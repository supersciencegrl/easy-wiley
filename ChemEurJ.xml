         <title>Contrasting the Mechanism of H2 Activation by Monomeric and Potassium&#8208;Stabilized Dimeric Al(I) Complexes: Do Potassium Atoms Exert any Cooperative Effect?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminyl anions are low valent, anionic and carbenoid aluminum species. Various research groups have detected that the potassium atoms play a stabilization role via electrostatic and cation  &#8230;  &#960; interactions with nearby (aromatic)&#8208;carbocyclic rings. In this work, the activation of H  2  utilizing a NON&#8208;xanthene&#8208;Al dimer (  D  ) and monomeric (  M  ) catalysts are studied to reveal the potential role of K  +&#160;  atoms during the activation of this gas.&#160; We aim to reveal whether if  D  is more reactive than  M  (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the  D  catalyst . The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric catalysts were found to be very close (around 33 kcal mol  &#8208;1  ). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the natures of the energy barriers are inherently different, the former being dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants. Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H  2  distorts the most, usually over 0.77&#916;E  dist  . Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies are the main stabilizing components of the interaction energy. The results suggest that the K  +  atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their catalytic role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H  2  . Cooperation between the two monomers in  D  is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H  2  is wholly disengaged.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing H2 Evolution Activity Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2 formed an S&#8208;type heterojunction. The mixed interface structure between them provided a new hydrogen&#8208;producing active center for each. In addition, the S&#8208;type heterojunction electron transfer mechanism not only promoted the separation of electrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+) between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2, but also retained electrons with strong reducibility, thereby promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S) of CoS2 nanospheres modified Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution was synthesized and studied. The H2 evolution rate of the composite catalyst reached 25.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which was 3.26&#8197;times that of single Zn0.5Cd0.5S, whereas pure CoS2 showed almost no hydrogen production activity. Moreover, CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S had excellent stability and the hydrogen production rate after six cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19&#8201;%. In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was better than CoS2 or Zn0.5Cd0.5S single catalyst. In this study, the synthesized CoS2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S were both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H+ protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8722;/C&#8722;Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular thiophene&#8208;arene C&#8722;C heterocoupling is successfully achieved in a set of topologically and electronically engineered bis(biaryl)thiophenes (BATs) under Scholl oxidative conditions to provide symmetric and unsymmetric diphenanthrothiophenes (DPTs), simple thiananographenes. The thia&#8208;edge of diphenanthrothiophenes are conveniently transformed into blue&#8208;emissive and electrochemically stable N&#8722;/C&#8722;edged congeners.







Abstract
While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8722;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene's reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8722;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes which are basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple's electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8722;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8722;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Between Cyclodextrins and Hybrid Hexavanadates: What are the Driving Forces?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic or chaotropic effect? Hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates self&#8208;assemble with cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;) in water to form a wide variety of host&#8208;guest complexes. Such a supramolecular process originates from the ability of the CD host to desolvate the hybrid guests, but the nature of this solvent effect depends on the cyclodextrins, inducing direct consequences on redox properties of the guest.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest complexes between native cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) and hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates (POVs) [V6O13((OCH2)3C&#8722;R)2]2&#8211; with R = CH2CH3, NO2, CH2OH and NH(BOC) (BOC = N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl) were studied in aqueous solution. Six crystal structures determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the nature of the functional R group strongly influences the host&#8211;guest conformation and also the crystal packing. In all systems isolated in the solid&#8208;state, the organic groups R are embedded within the cyclodextrin cavities, involving only a few weak supramolecular contacts. The interaction between hybrid POVs and the macrocyclic organic hosts have been deeply studied in solution using ITC, cyclic voltammetry and NMR methods (1D 1H NMR, and 2D DOSY, and ROESY). This set of complementary techniques provides clear insights about the strength of interactions and the binding host&#8208;guest modes occurring in aqueous solution, highlighting a dramatic influence of the functional group R on the supramolecular properties of the hexavanadate polyoxoanions (association constant K1:1 vary from 0 to 2 000&#8197;M&#8722;1) while isolated functional organic groups exhibit only very weak intrinsic affinity with CDs. Electrochemical and calorimetric investigations suggest that the driving force of the host&#8208;guest association involving larger CDs (&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) is mainly related to the chaotropic effect. In contrast, the hydrophobic effect supported by weak attractive forces appears as the main contributor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;containing host&#8208;guest complexes. In any cases, the origin of driving forces is clearly related to the ability of the macrocyclic host to desolvate the exposed moieties of the hybrid POVs.

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical oligophenylene: Chiral cyclic homologues with unique structures such as double helices and twisted triangles, have been synthesized as highly emissive chiroptical dyes. The twisted quaterphenyl units exhibited CPL with a high quantum yield (0.73&#8211;0.80), leading to relatively high CPL brightness.







Abstract
A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (2) and trimer (3) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in 2 adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore, 3 forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that 2 has a larger strain energy than 3 owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH2Cl2 solution. The spectra of both 2 and 3 are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety. These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (&#981;=0.70&#8211;0.83) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|gCPL|=1.6&#215;10&#8722;3) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Blue OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 7.5&#8201;% Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Better Constructions: By inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building block, two D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent blue emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI were designed and synthesized. Impressively, the doped deep&#8208;blue OLED based on IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI exhibited excellent performances with an unexpectedly high EQE of 7.5&#8201;% with the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which is one of the best among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12.







Abstract
Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, the authors successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI, featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high photo luminescent quantum yields and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 4.32&#8201;% and 5.41&#8201;%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI was achieved with an excellent CEmax of 5.83 cd A&#8722;1, EQEmax of 4.6&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly, IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI&#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQEmax of 7.51&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T7 to S2. Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.

         <title>Janus All&#8208;Cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;Pentafluorocyclohexyl Building Blocks Applied to Medicinal Chemistry and Bioactives Discovery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl building blocks have been incorporated into medicinal chemistry type products. These cyclohexanes have polarized faces and represent a unique motif for medicinal chemistry. The paper introduces a range of new accessible building blocks which can be elaborated into a diversity of drug type structures demonstrating their wider utility for exploration in bioactives discovery chemistry.







Abstract
Monoalkylated derivatives of the unusually polar all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorocyclohexyl (Janus face) motif are prepared starting from an aryl hydrogenation of 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorophenylacetate methyl ester 15. The method used Zeng's Rh(CAAC) carbene catalyst 4 in the hydrogenation following the protocol developed by Glorius. The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester 16 was converted to the corresponding alcohol 18, aldehyde 13, bromide 29 and azide 14 through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi&#8208;multicomponent and Cu&#8208;catalysed click reactions. NBoc protected pentafluoroarylphenylalanine methyl ester 35 was also subject to an aryl hydrogenation, and then deprotection to generate the Janus face &#946;&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl&#8208;alanine amino acid 15, which was incorporated into representative members of an emerging class of candidate antiviral compounds. Log&#8197;P measurements demonstrate that the all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl ring system is more polar than a phenyl ring.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Janus all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorocyclohexyl building blocks have been incorporated into medicinal chemistry type products. These cyclohexanes have polarized faces and represent a unique motif for medicinal chemistry. The paper introduces a range of new accessible building blocks which can be elaborated into a diversity of drug type structures demonstrating their wider utility for exploration in bioactives discovery chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoalkylated derivatives of the unusually polar all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; 2,3,4,5,6- pentafluorocyclohexyl (Janus face) motif are prepared starting from an aryl hydrogenation of 2,3,4,5,6- pentafluorophenylacetate methyl ester &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;. The method used Zeng's Rh(CAAC) carbene catalyst &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; in the hydrogenation following the protocol developed by Glorius. The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; was converted to the corresponding alcohol &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt;, aldehyde &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;, bromide &lt;b&gt;29&lt;/b&gt; and azide &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt; through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi-multicomponent and Cu-catalysed click reactions. NBoc protected pentafluoroarylphenylalanine methyl ester &lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; was also subject to an aryl hydrogenation, and then deprotection to generate the Janus face &#946;-pentafluorocyclohexyl-alanine amino acid &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;, which was incorporated into representative members of an emerging class of candidate antiviral compounds. Log&#8197;P measurements demonstrate that the all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorocyclohexyl ring system is more polar than a phenyl ring. In overview the paper introduces new building blocks containing this Janus ring and demonstrates their progression to molecules typically used in bioactives discovery programmes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Direct N&#8208;Trifluoropropenylation of Heterocycles with a Hypervalent Iodonium Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
E&#8208;selective trifluoropropenylation of versatile N&#8208;heterocycles was developed with the utilization of trifluoropropenyliodonium salts. The procedure enables the straightforward direct introduction of the trifluoroalkenyl moiety into heterocyclic scaffolds under simple and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The availability and synthesis of fluorinated enamine derivatives such as N&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropenyl)heterocycles are challenging, especially through direct functionalization of the heterocyclic scaffold. Herein, a stereoselective N&#8208;trifluoropropenylation method based on the use of a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropenyl iodonium salt is described. This reagent enables the straightforward trifluoropropenylation of various N&#8208;heterocycles under mild reaction conditions, providing trifluoromethyl enamine type moieties with high stereoselectivity and efficiency.

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity exploration by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT of a cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complex, as the first member of a new series of Au(III) complexes, has confirmed the low hydricity in dark and the high propensity to undergo substitution reactions leading to H2 release when irradiated. Computational photophysical characterization has allowed the identification of the excited singlet and triplet states involved in substitution reactions. Two&#8208;photon excitation feasibility has been also tested.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named 1&#8201;a, is reported. Complex 1&#8201;a low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H2 elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two&#8208;photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.

         <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere&#8211;Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon sphere&#8211;implanted graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet photocatalysts were prepared by a bottom&#8208;up method. The photocatalysts promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through special interface coupling and hollow carbon spheres as an electron acceptor, leading to remarkably improved photocatalytic efficiency. This work thus provides an efficient pathway for the design of efficient and low&#8208;cost cocatalysts for photocatalysis.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly was employed to manipulate inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular interaction of PBI&#8208;based complexes (trigonal prism and dicycle). Two complexes exhibit distinct different properties on excited state process and aggregation behaviour due to their geometrical arrangements. Trigonal prism to dicycle transformation could be tracked by fluorescence change. (Note: ISC and SB&#8208;CS in graphic are intersystem crossing and symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation, respectively.)







Abstract
Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (2) and a trigonal prism (3) were generated via using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent, cis&#8208;(PEt3)2Pt(OTf)2&#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an ortho&#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (1), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (&#8764;13&#8201;%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC). 2, however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of &#8764;41&#8201;%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of 3 is merely &#8764;6&#8201;% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly, 3 could be fully transformed into 2 by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover, 2 tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but 3 does not show the property. Therefore, controlling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared via organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>
Strongly activated halogen bond donors give rise to observable bound and unbound states in Raman spectroscopy when paired with good halogen bond acceptors. The two strongest halogen bond donors examined have almost identical electrostatic potentials, but differ vastly in theoretical binding affinity and experimental halogen bonding strength. The energy terms giving rise to this behavior are elucidated by energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.

         <title>Facile Conversion of Molecularly Complex (Hetero)aryl Carboxylic Acids into Alkynes for Accelerated SAR Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into the bioisostere world: A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation is reported that allows the synthesis of aryl alkynes from highly functionalized aryl and heteroaryl carboxylic acids. The reaction shows an unmatched substrate scope mainly thanks to its remarkably mild reaction conditions using a homogenous Pd/Cu bimetallic system. The utility of this protocol was showcased by the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8722;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization by copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8722;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation that allows the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labeled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of defect generation by thermal reduction on the structure and electrocatalytic performance of LaNiO3 has been examined in a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Surface defects, predominantly surface oxygen vacancies, promote oxygen evolution over LaNiO3 resulting in a significantly lower overpotential (380&#8197;mV) for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faster kinetics (70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope) and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes to conventionally prepared LaNiO3.

         <title>Formation and Structure of Hydrolytic Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling of kinetics using density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation, reveals that methylaluminoxane activators are sheets formed by assembly of linear oligomers, wherein the statistics and mechanism of aggregation favor formation of even&#8208;numbered sheets.







Abstract
Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me3Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterisation of Luminescent [CrIII2L(&#956;&#8208;carboxylato)]3+ Complexes with High&#8208;Spin S=3 Ground States (L=N6S2 donor ligand)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand chromium(III) complexes, [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+, where L represents a macrocyclic binucleating hexaamine&#8208;dithiophenolato ligand and R=Me or Ph, has been achieved. The complexes exhibit a relatively strong intramolecular ferromagnetic exchange interaction that leads to an S=3 spin ground state (J &#8764;24&#8211;34&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The complexes emit at 750&#8197;nm (&#934;L=45&#8201;%) by excitation into the intense LMCT and d&#8208;d* bands.







Abstract
The synthesis, structure, magnetic, and photophysical properties of two dinuclear, luminescent, mixed&#8208;ligand [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+ complexes (R=CH3 (1), Ph (2)) of a 24&#8208;membered binucleating hexa&#8208;aza&#8208;dithiophenolate macrocycle (L)2&#8722; are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals an edge&#8208;sharing bioctahedral N3Cr(&#956;&#8208;SR)2(&#956;1,3&#8208;O2CR)CrN3 core structure with &#956;1,3&#8208;bridging carboxylate groups. A ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the electron spins of the Cr3+ ions leads to a high&#8208;spin (S=3) ground state.

         <dc:description>The synthesis of novel (N&#8208;)acene&#8208;based cyclooligomers is reported. Glaser&#8208;Hay&#8208;coupling of the bisethynylated monomers results in cyclodimers and cyclotrimers, separable by column and gel permeation chromatographies. For the diazatetracene, the usage of  sec  &#8208;butyl&#8208;silylethynyl groups is necessary to achieve solubility. Diazatetracene&#8208;based cyclodimers and cyclotrimers were used as semiconductors in thin film transistors. Although their optoelectronic properties are quite similar, their electron mobilities in proof of concept thin film transistors differ by an order of magnitude.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Double C&#8212;H Bond Activation in a Germylene&#8208;Rhodium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal tetrylene complexes offer great opportunities for molecular cooperation due to the ambiphilic character of the group 14 element. Here we focus on the coordination of germylene [(Ar Mes2 ) 2 Ge:] (Ar Mes = C 6 H 3 &#8208;2,6&#8208;(C 6 H 2 &#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me 3 ) 2 ) to [RhCl(COD)] 2 (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), which yields a neutral germyl complex in which the rhodium center exhibits both &#951; 6 &#8208; and &#951; 2 &#8208;coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer&#8208;type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8212;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium&#8208;germyl species associated to three C&#8212;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.</dc:description>

The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D&#8208;coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid&#8208;state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields up to 74%. The emission is mainly based on ion specific lanthanide&#8208;dependent intra 4f&#8211;4f&#8208;transitions for Tb  3+  : green, Dy  3+  : yellow, Sm  3+  : orange&#8208;red, Eu  3+  : red. For the Gd  3+  containing compounds, yellow emission of ligand triplet&#8208;based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77 K. Co&#8208;doping of the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks with Eu  3+  and Tb  3+  allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we present a novel intermolecular radical addition/cyclization and Se&#8208;group transfer reaction of terminal alkynes and unsaturated alkyl selenide. The present strategy offers a straightforward, and facile approach for the synthesis of valuable Se&#8208;containing cyclopentenes. The remarkable features of this strategy include easily accessible starting materials, metal&#8208;free and peroxide&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, simple operation and broad substrate scope. More importantly, the reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and can be extended to the construction of six&#8208;membered carbon ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Dependent Dissolution of Non&#8208;Cubic Au Crystallites in Aqua Regia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqua regia readily dissolves the fcc tips of the Au bipyramidal crystallites and the core consisting of tetragonal and orthorhombic lattices, undergoes transformation to produce increased proportions of tetragonal lattices, before eventually giving up in dissolution. The study not only showcases the reactivity patterns associated with different Au lattices but also provides an insight into the lattice distribution within the crystallite.







Abstract
Properties of metal crystallites are governed by their morphologies and inherent crystal structures. In this work, bipyramidal Au microcrystallites hosting non&#8208;cubic lattices, body&#8208;centered orthorhombic and tetragonal (together termed as bc(o,t)), are investigated for their stability in aqua regia. Specifically, microcrystallites comprising 92&#8201;% of bc(o,t) have been subjected to aqua regia of different concentrations and the changes in morphology and lattice phases have been monitored using scanning electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The dissolution process was found to be crystal structure dependent and begin at the bipyramidal tips enriched with fcc lattice while retaining the bc(o,t) rich body. Interestingly, with increasing the reaction times, the remaining core was found to be highly reluctant to dissolution and instead, transformed to tetragonal lattices which with increasing treatment, exhibited lattice parameters closer to that of fcc. The study reveals the presence of a bc(o,t)&#8208;fcc core&#8208;shell structure with the tips enriched with fcc.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Benzylations and Allylations at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced C&#8722;H benzylation under ruthernium catalysis enabled exceedingly mild syntheses of diarylmethane compounds. The robustness of this approach was demonstrated by an ample scope, including photo C&#8722;H allylations and reactions on water.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of diarylmethane compounds was realized under exceedingly mild photoredox conditions without the use of exogenous photocatalysts. The versatility and robustness of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H benzylation was reflected by an ample scope, including multifold C&#8722;H functionalizations, as well as transformable pyrazoles, imidates and sensitive nucleosides. Mechanistic studies were indicative of a photoactive cyclometalated ruthenium complex, which also enabled versatile C&#8722;H allylations.

         <title>Trinuclear Cyanido&#8208;Bridged [Cr2Fe] Complexes: To Be or not to Be a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet, a Matter of Straightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanido&#8208;bridged trinuclear [CrIII2FeII] complexes were investigated in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical Fe&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on their SMM behaviors. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.







Abstract
Trinuclear systems of formula [{Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2}2M(H2LN3O2R)] (M=MnII and FeII, LN3O2R stands for pentadentate ligands) were prepared in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical M&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII derivatives and in turn on their Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviors. The cyanido&#8208;bridged [Cr2M] derivatives were obtained by assembling trans&#8208;dicyanido CrIII complex [Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2]&#8722; and divalent pentagonal bipyramid complexes [MII(H2LN3O2R)]2+ with various R substituents (R=NH2, cyclohexyl, S,S&#8208;mandelic) imparting different steric demand to the central moiety of the complexes. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the [Cr2Fe] complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects of the bending of the apical C&#8722;N&#8722;Fe linkages on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.

Iron power: A cyclometalated Fe(II) and Ir(III) complex based on the cationic (&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]imidazole skeleton is reported. Compared to its neutral analogue without the [CpFe]+ fragment, it is surprisingly active in the transfer hydrogenation of ketones. Mechanistic investigation on the reaction paths performed by DFT calculations provided a better understanding of the reaction mechanism, possible intermediates and the active species.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitution of [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;chlorobenzene)iron(II)] hexafluorophosphate with sodium imidazolate resulted in the formation of [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]imidazole hexafluorophosphate. The corresponding dicationic imidazolium salt, which was obtained by treating this imidazole precursor with methyl iodide, underwent cyclometallation with bis[dichlorido(&#951;5&#8208;1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl]iridium(III) in the presence of triethyl amine. The resulting bimetallic iridium(III) complex is the first example of an NHC complex bearing a cationic and cyclometallated [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]+ substituent. As its iron(II) precursors, the bimetallic iridium(III) complex was fully characterized by means of spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, it was investigated in a catalytic study, wherein it showed high activity in transfer hydrogenation compared to its neutral analogue having a simple phenyl instead of a cationic [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]+ unit at the NHC ligand.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformations of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxyketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium and enzyme catalysis were combined in a one&#8208;pot procedure to achieve efficient DYKAT of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones. This newly developed protocol offers straightforward access to enantiomerically pure and diastereomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;oxoacetates in high yields by employing a ruthenium&#8208;based racemization catalyst for efficient racemization&#8208;epimerization of substrates via formation of non&#8208;chiral 1,3&#8208;diketone intermediates.







Abstract
Herein we report on the development and application of chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DYKAT) of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones (&#946;&#8208;HKs), using Candida antartica lipase B (CALB) as transesterification catalyst and a ruthenium complex as epimerization catalyst. An operationally simple protocol allows for an efficient preparation of highly enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;oxoacetates. The products were obtained in yields up to 95&#8201;% with good diastereomeric ratios.

         <title>Plasmon Coupling Enhanced Micro&#8208;spectroscopy and Imaging for Sensitive Discrimination of Membrane Domains of a Single Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different cell&#160;membrane domains play different roles&#160;in many&#160;cell processes, and the discrimination of these domains is of considerable&#160;importance for the elucidation of cellular functions.&#160;However, the strategies&#160;available for distinguishing these cell membrane&#160;domains&#160;are limited.&#160;We propose a novel technique called plasmon coupling enhanced micro&#8208;spectroscopy and imaging&#160;to discriminate basal and lateral membrane domains of a single cell.&#160;This technology combines&#160;the application of an&#160;additional plasmonic silver film for&#160;surface plasmon&#160;(SP) excitation to selectively excite and enhance&#160;the basal membranes in the near&#8208;field with directional enhanced microscopic imaging and spectroscopy. The SP and critical evanescent fields are induced upon excitation&#160;through a&#160;silver&#8208;coated semitransparent coverslip at the SPR and critical&#160;angles, respectively. The basal and lateral membrane domains&#160;located within the SP and critical evanescent fields can be selectively excited and distinguished&#160;by adjusting the incident angle of laser&#160;irradiation. Moreover, the brighter images and more intense&#160;spectra of membrane&#8208;targeting fluorescence&#8208;Raman probes under directional excitation than in conventional EPI mode&#160;allow clear identification of the membrane domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Study of the Cycloaddition of CO2 with Styrene Oxide Over Six&#8208;Connected spn Topology MOFs (Zr, Hf) at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs with six Zr6 or Hf6 clusters were used for the catalytic CO2 and styrene oxide cycloaddition reactions. They all have the same spn topology skeletons, and ortho&#8208;octahedral morphology. MOF&#8208;818&#8208;Zr with higher acid site density exhibited good catalytic activity and stability at room temperature and an initial pressure of 1&#8197;bar CO2. DFT results showed that the metal was coordinated to the styrene oxide and the halogen attacked the &#946;&#8208;carbon of the styrene oxide (ND&#8208;ERO).







Abstract
A series of MOFs with a 6&#8208;connected spn topology were synthesized (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(Zr, Hf), PCN&#8208;777&#8208;(Zr, Hf), MOF&#8208;818&#8208;(Zr, Hf)). Through the in&#8197;situ DRIFTS of NH3 adsorption&#8208;desorption, we found that the activated catalyst mainly contains Lewis acid sites. The effects of different organic ligands on the Lewis acid of the Zr6 cluster were analyzed by XPS and NH3&#8208;TPD, and the relative Lewis acidity of the same metal was obtained: PCN&#8208;777&gt;MOF&#8208;808&gt;MOF&#8208;818. In the Py&#8208;FTIR results, we confirmed that MOF&#8208;818 has a higher acid site density. In the activity test, MOFs with mesoporous structure showed better catalytic activity under normal temperature and pressure. Among them, MOF&#8208;818 can still maintain a high degree of crystallinity after catalysis. Finally, we use density functional theory to propose the mechanism of the cycloaddition reaction of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. The results show that the metal is coordinated with styrene oxide and halogens attack the &#946; carbon of the epoxide.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Tri&#8208;/Difluoromethyl Ketones from Carboxylic Acids by Cross&#8208;Coupling with Acyloxyphosphonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advantageous synthetic route: Deoxytrifluoromethylation and difluoromethylation of carboxylic acids give access to di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl ketones. The key to the success of these transformations is the use of acyloxyphosphonium ions prepared in&#8197;situ as acyl electrophiles. The protocols use extremely mild reaction conditions and short reactions times and can tolerate a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
A simple and straightforward approach to the synthesis of trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl ketones from widely available carboxylic acids is disclosed. The transformation utilizes an acyloxyphosphonium ion as the active electrophile, conveniently generated in&#8197;situ from the carboxylic acid substrate by using commodity chemicals. The utility of the reaction system is exemplified by its chemoselectivity, with tolerance to a variety of important functional groups. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of carboxylic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and pharmaceutically relevant compounds is also discussed.

         <title>An Isolable Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanone and Its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone: bis(imino)germanone [IPrN]2Ge=O (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. Initial reactivity studies combined with experimental and computational bonding analysis revealed highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Moreover, transition metal oxide&#8208;like reactivity has been observed for the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide.







Abstract
A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone [IPrN]2Ge=O (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. The germanone has a rather high thermal stability in arene solvent, and no detectable change was observed at 80&#8201;&#176;C for at least one week. However, high thermal stability of [IPrN]2Ge=O does not prevent its reactivity toward small molecules. Structural analysis and initial reactivity studies revealed the highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Besides, the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide make it a mimic of nucleophilic transition&#8208;metal oxides. Mechanism for O&#8208;atom transfer reaction was investigated via DFT calculations, which revealed that the reaction proceeds via a [2+2] cycloaddition intermediate.

         <title>[(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ Complexes as a New Family of Anticancer Candidates: Synthesis, Characterization and Exploration of the Antiproliferative Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reorganization of the coordination sphere of the [(C&#8201;N&#8201;C)AuL]+ scaffold led to the establishment of the [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ family with a preserved redox stability but an enhanced reactivity toward biomolecules making it a new class of organogold anticancer agent.







Abstract
A library of eleven cationic gold(III) complexes of the general formula [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ when C&#8201;C is either biphenyl or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;ditertbutyldiphenyl and N&#8201;N is a bipyridine, phenanthroline or dipyridylamine derivative have been synthesized and characterized. Contrasting effects on the viability of the triple negative breast cancer cells MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 was observed from a preliminary screening. The antiproliferative activity of the seven most active complexes were further assayed on a larger panel of human cancer cells as well as on non&#8208;cancerous cells for comparison. Two complexes stood out for being either highly active or highly selective. Eventually, reactivity studies with biologically meaningful amino acids, glutathione, higher order DNA structures and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) revealed a markedly different behavior from that of the well&#8208;known coordinatively isomeric [(C&#8201;N&#8201;C)Au(NHC)]+ structure. This makes the [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ complexes a new class of organogold compounds with an original mode of action.

         <title>A Full Flexible NH4+ Ion Battery Based on the Concentrated Hydrogel Electrolyte for Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full flexible ammonium ion battery composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between a NH4V3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and a polyaniline anode is reported. The simple synthesis of the hydrogel using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water, allows to facilely tune and optimize the salt concentration in the electrolyte, to maximize its ionic conductivity and transport kinetics. It is found that the battery based on the electrolyte prepared using 3&#8197;M ammonium sulfate solution exhibits the best performance.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal ammonium (
) ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of 
 redox chemistry in batteries, particularly in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full 
 ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode, for enhanced performance. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference, the AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121&#8197;mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. On the other hand, the simple synthesis of the hydrogel electrolyte allows us to facilely tune and optimize the salt contents in the electrolyte, to maximize the ionic conductivity, transport kinetics, mechanical characteristics, and consequently the battery performance. It is found that the flexible battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3&#8197;M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance, i.&#8201;e., a capacity of 60&#8197;mAh g&#8722;1 while maintaining a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for developments of novel electrochemical energy storage technology with high safety and low cost.

         <title>Diastereoselective Double C&#8722;H Functionalization of Chiral Ferrocenes with Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;Complexes with N&#8208;Boc protected amino acids catalyze diastereoselective oxidative double C&#8722;H functionalization of chiral ferrocenyl amines with heteroarenes. A range of thiophene, pyrrole, furan and indole ferrocene derivative can be obtained in a single step and in high diastereomeric purities. C&#8722;H activation products can be transformed to corresponding phosphines. 19F NMR and DFT calculations helped elucidate reaction mechanism and reasons for stereoinduction.







Abstract
Diastereoselective double C&#8722;H heteroarylation of chiral ferrocenes provides valuable compounds with multiple functionalities using mild reaction conditions and simple reagents. Pd&#8208;Complexes with chiral mono&#8208;protected amino acids afforded corresponding heteroarylated ferrocenyl amines in good yields and high diastereomeric purities. In this way, a variety of indole, thiophene, pyrrole, or furan substituents were introduced to the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, a range of relevant functional groups, for example ketone, ester, chloro, nitro, or silyl, are tolerated by this method. An alternative combination of amino acid and ferrocenyl amine configurations was leveraged to provide the complementary diastereomeric products. The products of C&#8722;H heteroarylation can be transformed into corresponding phosphines. Absolute configurations of CH&#8208;activation products were confirmed by the combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and CD spectroscopy. 19F NMR kinetic study and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons governing stereoinduction.

         <title>On the Origin of the Non&#8208;Planarity in Biarylsilyloxonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the pyramidalization of the oxygen center in biarylsilyl oxoniums salts was studied through NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a series of biphenylsilyl oxonium salts, and supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The structure determination of a series of biphenylsilyloxonium cations through NMR and XRD studies, supported by DFT calculations was carried out, allowing to get insights into the origin of the oxygen pyramidalization in biphenyl and binaphthylsilyl oxoniums. Low barrier of inversion in the oxygenyl series points toward a key role of the biaryl axis in the inversion of configuration at the oxygen center.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentadienylmagnesium bromides are accessible with high yields by a fast and smooth one&#8208;pot synthesis. In hydrocarbons and in ethereal solvents a dissociative Schlenk equilibrium is operative interconverting heteroleptic compounds into homoleptic congeners.







Abstract
In the in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C5H6 (HCp), C5H5&#8208;Si(iPr)3 (HCpTIPS)] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et2O)Mg(CpR)(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 (CpR=Cp (1), CpTIPS (2)). The Schlenk equilibrium of 2 in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(CpR)2] (3) and [(Et2O)MgBr(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 (4). Interfering solvation and aggregation as well as ligand redistribution equilibria hamper a quantitative elucidation of thermodynamic data for the Schlenk equilibrium of 2 in toluene. In ethereal solvents, mononuclear species [(Et2O)2Mg(CpTIPS)Br] (2&#8217;), [(Et2O)nMg(CpTIPS)2] (3&#8217;), and [(Et2O)2MgBr2] (4&#8217;) coexist. Larger coordination numbers can be realized with cyclic ethers like tetrahydropyran allowing crystallization of [(thp)4MgBr2] (5). The interpretation of the temperature&#8208;dependency of the Schlenk equilibrium constant in diethyl ether gives a reaction enthalpy &#916;H and reaction entropy &#916;S of &#8722;11.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 60&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Emerging Yttrium Phosphides with Tetrahedron Phosphorus and Superconductivity under High Pressures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides have triggered growing interest for their exotic structures and striking properties. Hence, within advanced structure search and first&#8208;principle calculations, we identify several unprecedented Y&#8208;P compounds (e.g., Y  3  P, Y  2  P, Y  3  P  2  , Y  2  P  3  , YP  2  , and YP  3  ) under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain&#8208;like network, buckled layer, three&#8208;dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly,  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  can be viewed as assemblage of diamond&#8208;like Y structure and rare vertex&#8208;sharing tetrahedral P4 units. Impressively, electron&#8208;phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature  T  c  of 10.2 K among binary transition metal phosphides. Remarkably, the EPC of  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P mainly arises from the contribution of low&#8208;frequency soft phonon modes, whereas mid&#8208;frequency phonon modes of  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  dominate. These results strengthen knowledge of metal phosphides and pave a way for seeking superconductive transition metal phosphides.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion Chemistry of Lutetacyclopropene toward Unsaturated C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the reaction chemistry of transition metallacyclopropenes has been well&#8208;established in the last decades, the reactivity of rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopropenes remains elusive. Herein, we report the reaction of lutetacyclopropene  1  toward a series of unsaturated molecules. The reaction of  1  with one equiv of PhCOMe, Ar  1  CHO (Ar  1  = 2,6&#8208;Me  2  C  6  H  3  ), W(CO)  6  , and PhCH=NPh provided oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene,  and azalutetacyclopentene  via 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O, C&#8801;O, or C=N bonds into Lu&#8722;C  sp2  bond, respectively. However, the reaction between  1  and Ar  2  N=C=NAr  2  (Ar  2  = 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  ) gave an acyclic lutetium complex with a  diamidinate  ligand by the coupling of one molecule of  1  with two carbodiimides, irrespective of the amount of carbodiimide employed. More interestingly, when  1  was treated with two equiv of Ar  1  CHO, the reductive coupling of two C=O bonds was discovered to give a  lutetium pinacolate complex along with the release of tolan.&#160;  Remarkably, the reactivity of  1  is significantly different from that of scandacyclopropenes; these metallacycles derived from  1  all represent the first cases in rare&#8208;earth organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entacapone (ENT) is a powerful catechol&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl transferase inhibitor that is used for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s syndrome, but the amount used must be well controlled to avoid overtreatment and side effect. Fast and selective detection of ENT needs well&#8208;matched energy levels and well&#8208;designed sensor&#8208;ENT interaction which is highly challenging. In this work, a water stable europium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (  Eu&#8208;TDA  ) was synthesized to detect ENT by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity in the presence of main coexisting and interference species of plasma with a limit of detection of 5.01 &#956;M. The experimental results showed that the luminescence of  Eu&#8208;TDA  can be effectively quenched by ENT via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect mechanism in the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing Reaction Pathways in Heterogeneously Catalysed Hydrogenation of Allyl Cyanide: The Chemical Nature of Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a mechanistic study on the formation of an active ligand layer over Pd(111), turning the catalytic surface highly active and selective in partial hydrogenation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Specifically, we investigate the chemical composition of a ligand layer consisting of allyl cyanide deposited on Pd(111) and its dynamic changes under the hydrogenation conditions. On pristine surface, allyl cyanide largely retains its chemical structure and forms a layer of molecular species with the CN bond oriented nearly parallel to the underlying metal. In the presence of hydrogen, the chemical composition of allyl cyanide strongly changes. At 100 K, allyl cyanide transfers to unsaturated imine species, containing the C=C and C=N double bonds. At increasing temperatures, these species undergo two competing reaction pathways. First, the C=C bond become hydrogenated and the stable N&#8208;butylimine species are produced. In the competing pathway, the unsaturated imine reacts with hydrogen to fully hydrogenate the imine group and produce butylamine. The latter species are unstable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions and desorb from the surface, while the N&#8208;butylimine adsorbates formed in the first reaction pathway remain adsorbed and act as an active ligand layer in selective hydrogenation of acrolein.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size Instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically analyzed element&#8211;element bonds of archetypal HnX&#8211;YHn&#160;molecules (X, Y = C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I), using density functional theory. One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e.g., from C&#8211;C to C&#8211;F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C&#8211;F to C&#8211;I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electro&#173;negativity difference.&#160;Instead, we show that the effective atom size is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance.&#160;We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on The Application of The Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi Reaction to The Synthesis of Novel Fluorinated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New scaffolds obtained by Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich or fluorinated alkenes to give corresponding oxetanes. The uncommon regioselectivity with the fluorinated alkenes is explained by the relative stabilities of 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of this Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. A metathesis (photo&#8208;Wittig reaction) yields amide isosteres.







Abstract
In the context of new scaffolds obtained by photochemical reactions, Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich alkenes to give oxetanes are described. A comprehensive study has then been carried out on the reaction of aromatic ketones with fluorinated alkenes. Depending on the substitution pattern at the oxetane ring, a metathesis reaction is described as a minor side process to give mono fluorinated alkenes. Overall, this last reaction corresponds to a photo&#8208;Wittig reaction and yield amid isosteres. In order to explain the uncommon regioselectivity of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with these alkenes, electrostatic&#8208;potential derived charges (ESP) have been determined. In a second computational study, the relative stabilities of the typical 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction have been determined. The results well explain the regioselectivity. Further transformations of the oxetanes or previous functionalization of the fluoroalkenes open perspectives for oxetanes as core structures for biologically active compounds.

         <title>Study of a Stable &#8220;Trifluoromethoxide Anion Solution&#8221; Arising from 2,4&#8208;Dinitro&#8208;Trifluoromethoxybenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable solution of the trifluoromethoxide anion was readily obtained by mixing 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) and DMAP. A detailed study and characterization of this solution has been described, in particular highlighting the crucial role of the DNTFB/DMAP ratio. This &#8220;trifluoromethoxide anion solution&#8221; was applied to perform metal&#8208;free SN2 reactions on alkyl bomides with yields up to 77&#8201;%.







Abstract
Despite recent advances, trifluoromethoxylation remains a challenging reaction. Here we describe an efficient trifluoromethoxylative substitution, using an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagent. By mixing DMAP with a slight excess of 1,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB), a stable solution of trifluoromethoxide anion is obtained and can be used to perform a SN2 reaction without any silver additives. A precise study of the properties and behavior of this unusual stable solution of CF3O&#8722; species is also performed.

         <title>Structural and Photophysical Characterization of All Five Constitutional Isomers of the Octaethyl&#8208;&#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;bacterio&#8208; and &#8208;isobacteriochlorin Series</title>

         <dc:description>
The single crystal structures, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, fluorescence emission properties, MCD spectra, and their singlet oxygen photosensitization properties of all octaethyl&#8208;&#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;porphyrin isomers are presented. DFT Computations reveal the underlying tautomeric equilibria and the strong electronic interactions of the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;functionalities with the porphyrinic &#960;&#8208;system. This contribution adds to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;auxochrome and lays the foundation for their further utilization.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that treatment of &#946;&#8208;octaethylporphyrin with H2O2/conc. H2SO4 converts it to a &#946;&#8208;oxochlorin as well as all five constitutional isomers of the corresponding &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;derivatives: two bacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo groups at opposite pyrrolic building blocks) and three isobacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;groups at adjacent pyrrolic building blocks). By virtue of the presence of the strongly electronically coupled &#946;&#8208;oxo auxochromes, none of the chromophores are archetypical chlorins, bacteriochlorins, or isobacteriochlorins. Here the authors present, inter alia, the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of all free&#8208;base diketone isomers and a comparative description of their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, and fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen photosensitization properties, Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra, and singlet excited state lifetimes. DFT computations uncover underlying tautomeric equilibria and electronic interactions controlling their electronic properties, adding to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying &#946;&#8208;oxo functionalities. This comparative study lays the basis for their further study and utilization.

Butterfly&#8208;like triarylamine dyads were synthesized through modified Sonogashira coupling reactions, which exhibit good solubility, thermal stability, and high charge carrier mobilities in OFET.







Abstract
Highly &#960;&#8208;extended butterfly&#8208;shaped triarylamine dyads with aryleneethynylene spacer were constructed using an efficient synthetic route. These aryleneethynylene&#8208;bridged dyads are highly fluorescent and exhibited high HOMO levels, and low bandgaps, which are suitable for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OFETs. The field&#8208;effect transistors were fabricated through a solution&#8208;processable method and exhibited promising p&#8208;type performance with field&#8208;effect mobility up to 4.3&#8197;cm2/Vs and high Ion/off of 108 under ambient conditions.

         <title>On the Roles of Electron Transfer in Catalysis by Nanoclusters and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various roles and functions of electron transfer in nanocatalysis, from H2 generation to materials and sustainable energy production, are all the more crucial and better managed as heterogeneous catalysts (nanoparticles and nanoclusters) now increasingly involve well&#8208;defined atomic and molecular components. The various aspects discussed in this minireview include NC&#8211;NPs as electron reservoirs, hydrogen production from water photocatalysis, electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;chain catalysis, Ullmann coupling, plasmonic hot electrons in photocatalysis, and, briefly, redox/electrocatalysis in energy conversion, water depollution and sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
Electron transfer plays a major role in chemical reactions and processes, and this is particularly true of catalysis by nanomaterials. The advent of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts, recently including atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs) as parts of nanocatalyst devices has brought increased control of the relationship between NP and NC structures and their catalytic functions. Consequently, the molecular definition of these new nanocatalysts has allowed a better understanding and management of various kinds of electron transfer involved in the catalytic processes. This Minireview brings a chemist&#8216;s view of several major aspects of electron&#8208;transfer functions concerning NPs and NCs in catalytic processes. Particular focus concerns the role of NPs and NCs as electron reservoirs and light&#8208;induced antenna in catalytic processes from H2 generation to more complex reactions and sustainable energy production.

         <title>A Pseudorotaxane System Containing &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Formed via Chiral Recognition with an AuI6AgI3CuII3 Molecular Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudorotaxanes are created from an AuI6AgI3CuII3 complex with d&#8208;penicillamine combined with dicarboxylate and &#947;&#8208;CD via a solvent&#8208;mediated crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. In the structure, a &#947;&#8208;CD ring is threaded by a dicarboxylate axle such that the smaller opening of &#947;&#8208;CD faces an AuI6AgI3CuII3 complex cap in a largely distorted manner. The corresponding complex with l&#8208;penicillamine does not accept a &#947;&#8208;CD ring in the structure.







Abstract
Solvent&#8208;mediated crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformations of [Au6Ag3Cu3(H2O)3(d&#8208;pen)6(tdme)2]3+ (d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+; pen2&#8722;=penicillaminate, tdme=1,1,1&#8208;tris(diphenylphosphinomethyl)ethane) to form unique supramolecular species are reported. Soaking crystals of d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ in aqueous Na2bdc (bdc2&#8722;=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) yielded crystals containing d&#8208;[1(bdc)(H2O)2]+ due to the replacement of a terminal aqua ligand in d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ by a monodentate bdc2&#8722; ligand. When &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) was added to aqueous Na2bdc, d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ was transformed to d&#8208;[1(bdc@&#947;&#8208;CD)(H2O)2]+, where a &#947;&#8208;CD ring was threaded by a bdc2&#8722; molecule to construct a pseudorotaxane structure. While the use of dicarboxylates with an aliphatic carbon chain instead of bdc2&#8722; afforded analogous pseudorotaxanes, such pseudorotaxane species were not formed when crystals of [Au6Ag3Cu3(H2O)3(l&#8208;pen)6(tdme)2]3+ (l&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+) enantiomeric to d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ were soaked in aqueous Na2bdc and &#947;&#8208;CD, affording only crystals containing l&#8208;[1(bdc)(H2O)2]+.

         <title>Autotandem Catalysis: Inexpensive and Green Access to Functionalized Ketones by Intermolecular Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Amidoalkynylation/Hydration Cascade Reaction via N&#8208;Acyliminium Ion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autotandem catalysis: Iron(III) catalysts were shown to efficiently catalyze intermolecular alkynylation reactions of various alkoxy, acetoxylactams, and hydroxylactams. This chemistry broadens the scope of iron catalysis by highlighting new aspects of iron salts &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity. More importantly, this approach is amenable to an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence affording expedient access to a new carbonyl structures.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts were applied in cascade&#8208;type reactions for the synthesis of different carbonyl compounds. The reactions proceeded by a new iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade of alkynylation/hydration by using both the &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Lewis acid properties of iron salts. The alkynylation reactions of several endo and exocyclic acetoxylactams were achieved with three different catalysts including FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, FeCl3, and Fe(OTf)3 showing the efficiency of &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity of iron (III) salts in catalyzing the alkynylation reaction. We also demonstrated that the reaction sequence could be shortened by the direct use of hydroxylactams, leading to an environmentally friendly protocol, avoiding the need to perform unnecessary lengthy steps. A combination of the hard/soft iron Lewis acid properties was then used to implement an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence allowing expedient access to a new carbonyl structures from trivial materials.

A combination of the hard/soft iron Lewis acid properties was then used to implement an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence allowing expedient access to a new carbonyl structures from trivial materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed CO&#8208;free carbonylative synthesis of 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives was developed. This new method employed readily available N&#8208;(o&#8208;bromoaryl)amides as the starting materials and inexpensive benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl triformate (TFBen) as the stable solid CO surrogate, which would not cause hydrodehalogenation of the starting materials. Remarkably, this method featured a very broad substrate scope and was especially useful for incorporation benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one structure into drugs and naturally biologically active compounds.







Abstract
A facile synthesis of 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives by Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between N&#8208;(ortho&#8208;bromoaryl)amides and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl triformate (TFBen) was developed. This procedure does not require the toxic and flammable gas CO as the carbonyl source and tolerates a wide scope of functional groups. Remarkably, 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones incorporated to natural products and drugs can be constructed by this method.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Dependent Peroxidase Mimicking Enzyme Activity of Copper Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, three different morphology (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) of Cu&#8208;MOP assemblies were obtained by adjusting binary solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;Dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol. Experimental results revealed that the Cu&#8208;MOPs nanofibers morphology with the highest peroxidase mimetic activity among these three assemblies, which is benefited for establishing the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. The present study constitutes a facile step toward the development of modulation of morphology and functionality of MOP for biomedical application.







Abstract
The morphology of nanomaterials (geometric shape and dimension) play a significant role in its various physical and chemical properties. Thus, it is essential to link morphology with performance in specific applications. For this purpose, the morphology of copper metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (Cu&#8208;MOP) can be modulated through distinct assembly process, which facilitates the exploration of the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. In this work, the assemblies of Cu&#8208;MOP with three different morphologies (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) were facilely prepared by the variation of solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, revealed the important role of the interaction between the surface group and the solvent on the morphology of these assemblies. Cu&#8208;MOP nanofibers exhibited the highest mimetic peroxidase enzyme activity over the Cu&#8208;MOP nanosheets and nanorods, which have been utilized in the detection of glucose. Cu&#8208;MOPs assemblies with tunable morphology accompanied with adjustable mimic peroxidase activity, had great potential applications in the field of bioanalytical chemistry and biomedicals.

         <title>Rational Design of a Confacial Pentaoctahedron: Anisotropic Exchange in a Linear ZnIIFeIIIFeIIIFeIIIZnII Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first linear pentanuclear transition metal complex comprised of five face&#8208;sharing octahedra &#8211; a confacial pentaoctahedron &#8211; has been designed using a dinucleating nonadentate ligand providing an N3O3 and an O6 ligand compartments. The confacial pentaoctahedron ZnIIFeIIIFeIIIFeIIIZnII has been synthesized by using two in&#8197;situ generated dinuclear ZnIIFeIII metallo ligands. The face&#8208;sharing bridging motive enforces short ZnIIFeIII and FeIIIFeIII distances of 2.83 and 2.72&#8197;&#197;, respectively, resulting in anisotropic ferromagnetic interactions.







Abstract
The first confacial pentaoctahedron comprised of transition metal ions namely ZnIIFeIIIAFeIIIBFeIIIAZnII has been synthesized by using a dinucleating nonadentate ligand. The face&#8208;sharing bridging mode enforces short ZnII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;FeIIIA and FeIIIA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;FeIIIB distances of 2.83 and 2.72&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Ab&#8208;initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations provide significant negative zero&#8208;field splittings for FeIIIA and FeIIIB with |DA|&gt;|DB| with the main component along the C3 axis. Hence, a spin&#8208;Hamiltonian comprised of anisotropic exchange, zero&#8208;field, and Zeeman term was employed. This allowed by following the boundary conditions from the theoretical results the simulation in a theory&#8208;guided parameter determination with Jxy=+0.37, Jz=&#8722;0.32, DA=&#8722;1.21, EA=&#8722;0.24, DB=&#8722;0.35, and EB=&#8722;0.01&#8197;cm&#8722;1 supported by simulations of high&#8208;field magnetic M&#246;ssbauer spectra recorded at 2&#8197;K. The weak but ferromagnetic FeIIIAFeIIIB interaction arises from the small bridging angle of 84.8&#176; being at the switch from anti&#8208; to ferromagnetic for the face&#8208;sharing bridging mode.

         <title>Quenched Lewis Acidity: Studies on the Medium Dependent Fluorescence of Zinc(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new zinc(II) coordination units based on Schiff base&#8208;like ligands equipped with nitrile groups were synthesized. In non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as chloroform, a close&#8208;to&#8208;zero emission was observed; this increased drastically upon addition of the Lewis base pyridine (&#934;=15&#8201;%). Interestingly, DFT calculations indicate that the intrinsically high Lewis&#8208;acidity of the zinc(II) metal center is hidden through formation of highly stable dimers.







Abstract
Three new zinc(II) coordination units [Zn(1&#8211;3)] based on planar&#8208;directing tetradentate Schiff base&#8208;like ligands H2(1&#8211;3) were synthesized. Their solid&#8208;state structures were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing the tendency to overcome the square&#8208;planar coordination sphere by axial ligation. Affinity in solution towards axial ligation has been tested by extended spectroscopic studies, both in the absorption and emission mode. The electronic spectrum of the pyridine complex [Zn(1)(py)] has been characterized by MC&#8208;PDFT to validate the results of extended TD&#8208;DFT studies. Green emission of non&#8208;emissive solutions of [Zn(1&#8211;3)] in chloroform could be switched on in the presence of potent Lewis&#8208;bases. While interpretation in terms of an equilibrium of stacked/non&#8208;fluorescent and destacked/fluorescent species is in line with precedents from literature, the sensitivity of [Zn(1&#8211;3)] was greatly reduced. Results of a computation&#8208;based structure search allow to trace the hidden Lewis acidity of [Zn(1&#8211;3)] to a new stacking motif, resulting in a strongly enhanced stability of the dimers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three new zinc(II) coordination units&lt;/b&gt; based on Schiff base-like ligands equipped with nitrile groups were synthesized. In non-coordinating solvents, such as chloroform, a close-to-zero emission was observed; this increased drastically upon addition of the Lewis base pyridine (&#934;=15&#8201;%). Interestingly, DFT calculations indicate that the intrinsically high Lewis-acidity of the zinc(II) metal center is hidden through formation of highly stable dimers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three new zinc(II) coordination units &lt;b&gt;[Zn(1&#8211;3)]&lt;/b&gt; based on planar-directing tetradentate Schiff base-like ligands &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3)&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized. Their solid-state structures were investigated by single crystal X-ray diffraction, showing the tendency to overcome the square-planar coordination sphere by axial ligation. Affinity in solution towards axial ligation has been tested by extended spectroscopic studies, both in the absorption and emission mode. The electronic spectrum of the pyridine complex &lt;b&gt;[Zn(1)(py)]&lt;/b&gt; has been characterized by MC-PDFT to validate the results of extended TD-DFT studies. Green emission of non-emissive solutions of &lt;b&gt;[Zn(1&#8211;3)]&lt;/b&gt; in chloroform could be switched on in the presence of potent Lewis-bases. While interpretation in terms of an equilibrium of stacked/non-fluorescent and destacked/fluorescent species is in line with precedents from literature, the sensitivity of &lt;b&gt;[Zn(1&#8211;3)]&lt;/b&gt; was greatly reduced. Results of a computation-based structure search allow to trace the hidden Lewis acidity of &lt;b&gt;[Zn(1&#8211;3)]&lt;/b&gt; to a new stacking motif, resulting in a strongly enhanced stability of the dimers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Titanium and Tantalum Phosphate LiNaTiTa2P2O13 with An Open Framework hosting Li and Na Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiNaTiTa2P2O13 displays an open framework comprised of staggered [Ti1/3Ta2/3O3]&#8734; layers and PO4 tetrahedra with a herringbone&#8208;like stacking pattern, similar to monophosphate niobium bronzes. The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li+ and Na+ ions, endow LiNaTiTa2P2O13 a moderate ion transport capability (4.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 823&#8197;K). In addition, the layers constituted by corner&#8208;sharing TiO6 and TaO6 octahedra endow a possibility as being photo&#8208;catalyst. The successful substitution of Nb for Ta results in the optical absorption red&#8208;shifted towards visible range with a narrowing band gap comparable to that of TiO2 (3.2&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Herein, we report a detailed structural, electric, thermal and optical analysis of a titanium and tantalum phosphate LiNaTiTa2P2O13. The title compound is comprised of typical ReO3&#8208;type layers constituted by corner&#8208;sharing TiO6 and TaO6 octahedra, bridged by PO4 tetrahedra, and the structure is closely related to monophosphate niobium bronzes. The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li+ and Na+ ions, endows LiNaTiTa2P2O13 a moderate ion transportation behavior (4.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 823&#8197;K). In addition, the successful substitution of Nb for Ta in LiNaTiTa2P2O13 results in the optical absorption red&#8208;shift towards visible range with a narrowing band gap, which may provide a route of isomorphic replacement to band engineering for photo&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Supported CuII Single&#8208;Ion Catalyst for Total Carbon Utilization of C2 and C3 Biomass&#8208;Based Platform Molecules in the N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upgrading biomass without waste: Scientists from Rostock and Lanzhou have, for the first time, succeeded in directly converting C2&#8722;C3 biomass molecules with amines and H2O2 to industrially important formamides by valorizing all carbon atoms of the substrates without producing undesired by&#8208;products. The reaction is catalyzed under very mild conditions by a 5A zeolite with active CuII single sites; .NHPh and .OOH radicals play a key role. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Br&#252;ckner, F.&#8197;Shi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102300).

         <title>Hybrid EuIII Coordination Luminophore Standing on Two Legs on Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;legged, standing&#8208;up molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent EuIII&#8211;silica nanomaterials is demonstrated. By using a Eu(hfa)3 complex with TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)3 (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) covalently bonded to the silica nanoparticles at two binding sites, nanoluminophores Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8208;Si)2&#8211;SiO2 were developed that have an excellent intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93%) and long emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms).

Fiber gels made of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;decorated chitosan and incorporating IrO2 nanoparticles (see SEM image in the background) can effectively perform photoinduced water oxidation with better performance than isolated components. In particular, a significantly higher quantum yield for water oxidation and a better stability of the system are reported.

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of Tunable Aryl Alkyl Ionic Liquids (TAAILs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;alkyl imidazolium ionic liquids (tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids, TAAILs) with electron withdrawing and electron donating substituents on the phenyl ring of the cation, various alkyl chain lengths and the bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiNTf2) anion have been prepared.

Tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) based on the imidazolium cation were first reported in 2009. Since then, a series of TAAILs with different properties due to the electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing effect of the substituents at the aryl ring has been developed. Herein, a wide variety of those ionic liquids (ILs) is presented in terms of their cation structure. The authors synthesized ILs containing the bromide or bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide anion and 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;alkyl imidazolium cations with various substituents in the ortho and/ or para position of the phenyl ring and alkyl chains of different lengths varying from butyl to dodecyl. The differences of their physical properties (melting point, thermal decomposition, viscosity, electro&#8208;chemical window) of these ILs are reported according to their structure.

Explaining the oxidation&#8211;cyclization mechanism of heterocycles containing Te&#8722;O bonds. The structures of halogenated Te&#8208;containing heterocycles have been elucidated, and computational methods showed them to be prepared in a two&#8208;step oxidation&#8211;cyclization. The three compounds shown represent both the structural diversity and the biological application of these hypervalent compounds as leishmanicides.

An electrochemical enabled three component cascade phosphorylation of carbazoles, indoles,phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph2PH has been well developed. A variety of organophosphorus compounds containing P(O)&#8722;X ( X=N, O, S) bonds are produced in moderate to excellent yields (50 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
An electrochemical three component cascade phosphorylation reaction of various heteroatoms&#8208;containing nucleophiles including carbazoles, indoles, phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph2PH has been established. Electricity is used as the &#8220;traceless&#8221; oxidant and water and air are utilized as the &#8220;green&#8221; oxygen source. All kinds of structurally diverse organophosphorus compounds with P(O)&#8208;N/P(O)&#8208;O/P(O)&#8208;S bonds are assembled in moderate to excellent yields (three categories of phosphorylation products, 50 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield). A tentative free radical course is put forward to rationalize the reaction procedure.

         <title>SnS Nanosheets for Rapid and Effective Bacteria Sterilization Under Near&#8208;infrared Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively is very urgent. SnS nanosheets are synthesized using a simple solvothermal method. SnS nanosheets generate heat as well as reactive oxygen species such as .OH, .O2&#8722; and 1O2 under near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Therefore, SnS nanosheets effectively inhibit the growth of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through the synergistic effect of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Today, the threat of pathogenic bacterial infection worldwide that leads to the increase of mortality rate strongly demands the development of new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively. Although there are a lot of antibacterial agents that have been developed so far, few studies on the antibacterial performance of SnS have been investigated at 808&#8197;nm laser. Here, we synthesized SnS nanosheets with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption performance and excellent antibacterial performance via a simple solvothermal synthesis route. The as&#8208;prepared SnS nanosheets showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (38.7&#8201;%), photodynamic performance, and photostability, and at the same time 99.98&#8201;% and 99.7&#8201;% sterilization effect against Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) under near&#8208;infrared irradiation (808&#8197;nm, 1.5&#8197;W/cm2). This study suggests that SnS nanosheets could be a promising candidate for antibacterial therapy owing to the synergetic effects of photothermal and photodynamic performance.

         <title>Photophysics of Azobenzene Constrained in a UiO Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Effects of Pressure, Solvation and Dynamic Disorder</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putting the pressure on azobenzene photophysics: When locked in a UiO metal&#8211;organic framework, the azobenzene chromophore is geometrically constrained but exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. This is a unique and advantageous environment in which to explore fundamental photophysical properties. Optical spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell enables the photophysical consequences of pressure&#8208;induced changes in solvation and conformation of the chromophore to be observed and correlated with crystallographic data.







Abstract
Photophysical studies of chromophoric linkers in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are undertaken commonly in the context of sensing applications, in search of readily observable changes of optical properties in response to external stimuli. The advantages of the MOF construct as a platform for investigating fundamental photophysical behaviour have been somewhat overlooked. The linker framework offers a unique environment in which the chromophore is geometrically constrained and its structure can be determined crystallographically, but it exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure studies enable the photophysical consequences of controlled, incremental changes in local environment or conformation to be observed and correlated with structural data. This approach is demonstrated in the present study of the trans&#8208;azobenzene chromophore, constrained in the form of the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azobenzenedicarboxylate (abdc) linker, in a UiO topology framework. Previously unobserved effects of pressure&#8208;induced solvation and conformational distortion on the lowest energy, n&#960;* transition are reported, and interpreted the light of crystallographic data. It was found that trans&#8208;azobenzene remains non&#8208;fluorescent (with a quantum yield less than 10&#8722;4) despite the prevention of trans&#8208;cis isomerization by the constraining MOF structure. We propose that efficient non&#8208;radiative decay is mediated by the local, pedal&#8208;like twisting of the azo group that is evident as dynamic disorder in the crystal structure.

         <title>NMR Crystallography Enhanced by Quantum Chemical Calculations and Liquid State NMR for the Investigation of Se NHC Adducts.</title>

heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) are widely utilized in catalysis and material science. They are characterized by their steric and electronic properties. Steric properties are usually quantified on the basis of their static structure, which can be determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic properties are estimated in the liquid state; for example, via the 77Se liquid state NMR of Se&#8208;NHC adducts. We demonstrate that 77Se NMR crystallography can contribute to the characterization of the structural and electronic properties of NHC in solid and liquid states. Selected Se&#8208;NHC adducts are investigated via 77Se solid state NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography, supported by quantum chemical calculations. This investigation reveals a correlation between the molecular structure of adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts but also the other chemical shift tensor components. Afterwards, the liquid state 77Se NMR data is presented and interpreted in terms of the quantum chemistry modelling. The discrepancy between the structural and electronic properties, and in particular the &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities of adducts in the solid and liquid states is discussed. Finally, the 13C isotropic chemical shift from the liquid state NMR and the 13C tensor components are also discussed, and compared with their 77Se counterparts. 77Se NMR crystallography can deliver valuable information about NHC ligands, and together with liquid state 77Se NMR can provide an in&#8208;depth outlook on the properties of NHC ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;Diazapentalene: A Stable C=N&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System with Restored Antiaromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N&#8208;containing 4n&#960;&#8208;electron systems that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene moiety resulted in the much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the 8&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;periphery caused by the stabilization of the less&#8208;stable bond&#8208;shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H  2  &#8208;TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;&#8208;stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine(I) and Silver(I) Complexes of Benzoimidazole and Pyridylcarbazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of iodine(I) complexes with either benzoimidazole or carbazole&#8208;derived  sp  2  N  &#8208;containing Lewis bases is described, as well as their corresponding silver(I) complexes. The addition of elemental iodine to the linear two&#8208;coordinate Ag(I) complexes produces iodine(I) complexes with a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bond. The  1  H and  1  H&#8208;  15  N HMBC NMR studies unambiguously confirm the formation of the complexes in all cases via the [N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N]  +  &#8594; [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  cation exchange, with the  15  N NMR chemical shift change between 94 to 111 ppm when compared to the free ligand. The single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on four I  +  complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bonds with I &#8212; N bond distances of 2.21 &#8208; 2.26 &#197; and N &#8212; I &#8212; N angles of 177 &#8208; 180 &#176; , whilst some of the corresponding Ag  +  complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N angles of ca. 150 &#176; and Ag &#8212; N bond distances of 2.09 &#8208; 2.18 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>Push&#8210;Pull Stiff&#8208;Stilbene: Proton&#8208;Gated Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitching and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor substituted stiff&#8208;stilbene is shown to undergo isomerization induced by visible light avoiding the need for harmful UV light. This visible&#8208;light photoswitching is inhibited by protonation of the dimethylamino&#8208;donor unit, disrupting the push&#8208;pull character and thus, gating of the photochromic properties is allowed by acid/base addition. Remarkably, the addition of a mild acid also triggers fast thermal back isomerization, which is unprecedented for stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitches usually having a very high energy barrier for this process. These combined features offer unique orthogonal control over switching behavior by light and protonation, which is investigated in detail by  1  H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. In addition, TD&#8208;DFT calculations are used to gain further insight into the absorption properties. Our results will help elevating the level of control over dynamic behavior in stiff&#8208;stilbene applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Chiral Exciplexes with Sky&#8208;Blue and Green Circularly Polarized &#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorecence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent exciplexes based on a chiral electron donor molecule and achiral acceptor ones are reported as a new approach to design circularly polarized (CP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters.&#160; This innovative strategy results in rather high CP luminescence values with g lum up to 7 &#180; 10 &#8208;3 , almost one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the CPL signal recorded for the chiral donor alone ( g lum ~ 8 &#180; 10 &#8208;4 ). This increase occurs concomitantly to a CPL sign inversion, as a result of the strong charge&#8208;transfer emission character, as experimentally and theoretically rationalized using a covalent chiral Donor&#8208;Acceptor model. Interestingly, blue, green&#8208;yellow and red chiral luminescent exciplexes can be obtained by playing with the electron accepting character of the achiral unit while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks with novel catenane&#8208;like interlocking: metal&#8208;determined photoresponse and uranyl sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of two tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate ligands and different metal ions leads to seven isostructural MOFs, which show novel 2D&#174;2D supramolecular entanglement featuring catenane&#8208;like interlocking of tricyclic cages. The MOFs show tripyridinium&#8208;afforded and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties. The MOFs with d  10  metal centers (  1&#8208;Cd, 1&#8208;Zn, 2&#8208;Cd, 2&#8208;Zn)  show fast and reversible photochromism and concomitant fluorescence quenching,  1&#8208;Ni  displays slower photochromism but does not fluoresce, and  1&#8208;Co  and  2&#8208;Co  are neither photochromic nor fluorescent. We show that the network entanglement dictates donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which enable fluorescence originated from interligand charge transfer. The contacts also allow photoinduced electron transfer, which underlies photochromism and concomitant fluorescence response. The metal dependence in fluorescence and photochromism can be related to energy transfer through metal&#8208;centered  d&#8208;d  transitions. In addition,  1&#8208;Cd  is demonstrated to be a potential fluorescence sensor for sensitive and selective detection of UO  2  2+  in water</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high theoretical specific capacity, strong structural designability and relatively inexpensive manufacturing cost make the exploration of organic electrode materials more attractive in recent years. In this article, owing to the large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, plenty of nitrogen heteroatoms and multiring aromatic system, polyazaacene analogue poly(1,6&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,8&#8208;triyl&#8208;7&#8208;(2 H  )&#8208;ylidene&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethylidene) (PQL) was applied as the anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). PQL was almost insoluble in conventional liquid organic electrolyte (1 M NaClO 4  in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (v:v=1:1) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)), which strongly improved its cycle stability. The initial discharge capacity was obtained to be 1825 mAh g &#8208;1  at the current density of 100 mA g &#8208;1  and stabilized at 317 mAh g &#8208;1  after 400 cycles with the coulombic efficiency as high as 97%. It not only showed good rate capability at high current densities (202, 183 mAh g &#8208;1  at 1 A g &#8208;1  and 1.5 A g &#8208;1  ) but also had a superior energy density around 290 Wh kg &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

The (H  2  dapp) occupies a helical twisted pentagonal equatorial arrangement with two anionic ligands in the axial positions. Further influence on the electronic and magnetic structure is provided by a closely associated counterion interacting with the central N&#8208;H group of the (H  2  dapp). The slow relaxation of the magnetisation shows that the anionic acetates give the greatest slowing down of the magnetisation reversal. Further influence on the relaxation properties of compounds  (1)  and  (2)  is the presence of short nitrate&#8208;nitrate intermolecular ligand contact opening further lattice relaxation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; Halogen Bonding between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides an overview on halogen bonding (the noncovalent interaction between Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases) between ions of like charge. Next to theoretical studies, experimental examples in the solid state and in solution are covered and a comparison with other interactions is provided.







Abstract
Halogen bonding occurs between molecules featuring Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases. It is often rationalized as a predominantly electrostatic interaction and thus interactions between ions of like charge (e.&#8201;g., of anionic halogen bond donors with halides) seem counter&#8208;intuitive. Herein, we provide an overview on such complexes. First, theoretical studies are described and their findings are compared. Next, experimental evidences are presented in the form of crystal structure database analyses, recent examples of strong &#8220;anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonding in crystals, and the observation of such interactions also in solution. We then compare these complexes to select examples of &#8220;counter&#8208;intuitive&#8221; adducts formed by other interactions, like hydrogen bonding. Finally, we comment on key differences between charge&#8208;transfer and electrostatic polarization.

         <dc:description>
An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective hydroarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aryl halides and using silanes as hydride source is developed, affording functionalized arenes in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. The protocol shows a high tolerance to various functional groups on both the dienes and aryl coupling partners. Mechanism studies indicate that &#960;&#8208;allyl nickel species is likely to be involved in the catalysis.







Abstract
An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective hydroarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aryl halides and a silane has been developed, affording a range of allylic arenes in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. This method exhibits broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Late&#8208;stage modification of complex architectures was demonstrated.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Containing Carbadecaphyrins: Non&#8208;aromatic Expanded Porphyrins that Undergo Proton&#8208;Triggered Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of meso&#8208;free expanded carbaporphyrins containing carbazole as key structural elements have been prepared. By judicious choice of acid, access to three distinct structural forms in the solid state. No evidence of global aromaticity was observed in any of the forms. Notably, both macrocycles in their protonated forms exhibit substantial absorbance in the NIR region resulting in a panchromatic absorption that extends up to 1200&#8197;nm.







Abstract
A pair of meso&#8208;unsubstituted expanded carbaporphyrins containing two carbazole moieties were prepared in high isolated yields (82 and 76&#8201;%, respectively). The two macrocycles, namely 3 and 4, differ with respect to their substitution at the carbazole N&#8208;atoms i.&#8201;e. by H and i&#8208;Bu, respectively. As prepared in their free&#8208;base forms, macrocycles 3 and 4 adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformations and are best characterized as 40 &#960;&#8208;electron, non&#8208;aromatic species possessing a decaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) skeleton. Protonation of 3 with either trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or perchloric acid (HClO4) produces a parallelogram&#8208;shaped structure. A similar structure is produced when N&#8208;functionalized system 4 is treated with TFA. In contrast, protonation of 4 with HClO4 leads it to adopt a twisted M&#246;bius strip&#8208;like structure in the solid state, thus allowing access to three distinct conformational states as a function of the conditions.

         <title>Macrocyclic Inorganic Tin&#8208;Containing Oxo Clusters: Heterometallic Strategy for Configuration and Catalytic Activity Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented macrocyclic inorganic tin&#8208;containing oxo clusters have been successfully constructed, whose configuration, host&#8208;guest behaviors, supramolecular packing and catalytic activities are significantly modulated by the introduction of heterometals with different ionic radius.







Abstract
In this work, the first examples of inorganic macrocyclic tin&#8208;oxo clusters which are stabilized by sulfate ligands are reported. As determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, the prepared inorganic Sn10&#8208;oxo cluster displays interesting mixed valence behaviors, with 8 Sn4+ located at the cyclic skeleton and two Sn2+ encapsulated in the center. When further introducing Ti4+ and In3+ ions to the synthetic systems, heterometallic Sn2Ti6 and SnIn5Ti6 complexes with Ti6(SO4)9 and SnIn5(SO4)12 macrocyclic skeletons were prepared whose configuration and packing models were affected by the ionic radius of incorporated metals. Moreover, comparative CO2 reduction experiments confirm that such heterometallic composition can significantly improve the catalytic activities of these inorganic macrocyclic oxo clusters. This work represents a milestone in constructing inorganic tin complexes and also macrocyclic metal oxo clusters with tunable configurations and properties.

         <title>Tuning the Intrinsic Activity and Electrochemical Surface Area of MoS2 via Tiny Zn Doping: Toward an Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;doped MoS2 with S vacancies (Zn&#8722;Vs&#8722;MoS2, 1T phase) was developed for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Zn doping not only effectively increases the electrochemical specific surface area of MoS2 but also induces the formation of HER active 1T/2H&#8722;MoS2 phase and defects. Furthermore, it activates the in&#8208;plane sites of 1T&#8722;MoS2 so that the density of active sites and the intrinsic activity of reactive sites can be increased simultaneously. Therefore, the improved HER activity and stability are finally achieved.







Abstract
Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is considered as an alternative material for commercial platinum catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Improving the apparent HER activity of MoS2 to a level comparable to that of Pt is an essential premise for the commercial use of MoS2. In this work, a Zn&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to enhance the HER performance of MoS2. It is shown that tiny Zn doping into MoS2 leads to the enhancement of the electrochemical surface area, increases in proportion of HER active 1T phase in the material and formation of catalytic sites of higher intrinsic activity. These benefits result in a high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV(@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low Tafel slope of 58&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The origin for the excellent electrochemical performance of the doped MoS2 is rationalized with both experimental and theoretical investigations.

         <title>The Introduction of a Cysteine Residue Modulates The Mechanical Properties of Aromatic&#8208;Based Solid Aggregates and Self&#8208;Supporting Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels based on aromatic peptides can be generated taking advantages from &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bondings between the side chain of amino acids. The insertion of a crosslinkable cysteine residue in the middle of the peptide motif could allow the achievement of novel materials with improved mechanical properties for tissue engineering applications.







Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based hydrogels, originated by multiscale self&#8208;assembling phenomenon, have been proposed as multivalent tools in different technological areas. Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations pointed out the capability of completely aromatic peptides to gelificate if hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces are opportunely balanced. Here, the effect produced by the introduction of a Cys residue in the heteroaromatic sequence of (FY)3 and in its PEGylated variant was evaluated. The physicochemical characterization indicates that both FYFCFYF and PEG8&#8208;FYFCFYF are able to self&#8208;assemble in supramolecular nanostructures whose basic cross&#8208;&#946; motif resembles the one detected in the ancestor (FY)3 assemblies. However, gelification occurs only for FYFCFYF at a concentration of 1.5&#8197;wt%. After cross&#8208;linking of cysteine residues, the hydrogel undergoes to an improvement of the rigidity compared to the parent (FY)3 assemblies as suggested by the storage modulus (G&#8217;) that increases from 970 to 3360&#8197;Pa. The mechanical properties of FYFCFYF are compatible with its potential application in bone tissue regeneration. Moreover, the avalaibility of a Cys residue in the middle of the peptide sequence could allow the hydrogel derivatization with targeting moieties or with biologically relevant molecules.

Due to strict regulatory standards, it is unlikely that complex drug delivery systems can one day be translated into the clinic. The aim of this work is to develop a facile procedure for the preparation of a DDS based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the delivery of three anticancer drugs (doxorubicin (DOX), camptothecin (CPT), and zinc(II) phthalocyanine (Pc)) with different modes of action (combination chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)) following a convergent strategy.







Abstract
A pH&#8208;responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has been prepared for the delivery of three anticancer drugs with different modes of action. The novelty of this system is its ability to combine synergistic chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. A photoactive conjugate of a phthalocyanine (Pc) and a topoisomerase I inhibitor (topo&#8208;I), namely camptothecin (CPT), linked by a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain has been synthesized and then loaded into the mesopores of MSNs. Doxorubicin (DOX), which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor (topo&#8208;II), has also been covalently anchored to the outer surface of the MSNs through a dihydrazide PEG linker. In the acidic environment of tumor cells, selective release of the three drugs takes place. In vitro studies have demonstrated the endocytosis of the system into HeLa and HepG2 cells, and the subsequent release of the three drugs into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of DOX, CPT and Pc has been assessed in&#8197;vitro before and upon light irradiation.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Alkylidene Phthalides by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino C&#8722;H Acylation/Annulation of Benzamides with Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 8&#8208;aminoquinolin&#8208;derived benzamides with aliphatic carboxylic acids is described. This reaction goes through 8&#8208;aminoquinolin&#8208;directed C&#8722;H acylation of benzamides using acyl fluorides generated by carboxylic acids as carbonyl sources and concomitant conversion of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;derived amide into lactone. This synthetic method exhibited broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity for Z&#8208;isomers.







Abstract
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;derived benzamides with aliphatic acyl fluorides generated in&#8197;situ from the corresponding acids has been developed. This reaction initiated with 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation, which was accompanied by subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution of amide group to produce alkylidene phthalides This approach exhibits high stereo&#8208;selectivity for Z&#8208;isomer products, and tolerates a variety of functional groups as well as aliphatic carboxylic acids with diverse structural scaffolds.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic Materials for Cooperative Sodium Iodide Binding and Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic ion&#8208;pair receptors comprising of benzo15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 cation binding moieties and iodotriazole XB donors are covalently integrated into silica QuadraSilTM based solid supports. Investigations into their sodium halide extraction capabilities demonstrated their ability as NaI extraction agents from water. Comparison with HB analogues demonstrate the crucial role of XB&#8208;mediated NaI ion&#8208;pair binding in the extraction performance.







Abstract
A series of novel heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) receptor functionalised silica based materials, containing mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;iodotriazole benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 groups are investigated for the cooperative binding and extraction of sodium halide ion&#8208;pair species from aqueous solution. Characterisation of the XB materials by CHN elemental analysis, 13C CP/MAS&#8197;NMR and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopies confirms and quantifies the successful incorporation of the ion&#8208;pair receptor frameworks to the silica material. ICP&#8208;MS solid&#8208;liquid extraction studies demonstrate the bidentate XB functionalised material is capable of NaI extraction from water. Importantly, cooperative XB&#8208;mediated sodium halide ion&#8208;pair binding is determined to be crucial to the material's extraction capabilities, impressively demonstrating a two&#8208;fold enhancement in sodium iodide extraction efficiency relative to a heteroditopic hydrogen bonding receptor functionalised silica material analogue.

         <title>A Narrow Bandgap of 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Bilayer Perovskite with Giant Entropy Change and Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite: (IPA)2(FA)Pb2I7 (1, IPA+=C3H9NI+, FA+=CN2H5+), undergoes a solid reversible phase transition with Tc of 382&#8197;K accompanied by giant entropy change of 40&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Further optical investigations indicate that 1 reveals a narrow direct bandgap (2.024&#8197;eV) and a superior photoluminescence (PL) emission.







Abstract
The multifunctional two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have potential applications in many fields, such as, semiconductor, energy storage and fluorescent device etc. Here, a 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskite (IPA)2(FA)Pb2I7 (1, IPA+=C3H9NI+, FA+=CN2H5+) is determined for its photophysical properties. Strikingly, 1 reveals a solid reversible phase transition with Tc of 382&#8197;K accompanied by giant entropy change of 40&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Further optical investigations indicate that 1 reveals a narrow direct bandgap (2.024&#8197;eV) attributed to the slight bending of I&#8722;Pb&#8208;I edge and inorganic [Pb2I7]n layer and a superior photoluminescence (PL) emission with super long lifetime of 0.1607&#8197;ms. It is believed that this work will pave an avenue to further design multifunctional semiconductors that combines energy storage and photoelectric materials.

Through a new method of low&#8208;temperature (only 350&#8201;&#176;C) self&#8208;reduction, a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ was prepared, with a high PLQY of 95&#8201;% and a color purity of 97.6&#8201;%. Then, a WLED fabricated by the as&#8208;prepared CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ presents outstanding performance with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9&#8197;lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K.







Abstract
Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+). The crystal structure, morphology, chemical state, and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor have been investigated. By using the screened hybrid function (HSE06), the band gap (Eg) of CBH was calculated to be 7.48&#8197;eV, which is a necessary condition for achieving high quantum yield phosphors. The experiment results show that almost all the added raw materials of Eu3+ can be reduced to Eu2+ in CBH crystal under a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor shows a broad excitation spectrum centered at 277 and 327&#8197;nm in the range of 220 to 400&#8197;nm, and a narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428&#8197;nm in the range of 400 to 500&#8197;nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35&#8197;nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0&#8201;%), high external quantum efficiency (EQE=31.1&#8201;%), and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6&#8201;%). The PL intensity of CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ remains 62.6&#8201;% of the initial intensity at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+, excited by a 365&#8197;nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K. The above results show that CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ can be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to design and prepare other new types of highly efficient phosphors.

&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid-state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low-temperature self-reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue-emitting phosphor of Ca[B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13870-13878, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties by creating a &#960;&#8208;hole. In the adduct pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde the presence of fluorine atoms exchanges the electron donor&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to those observed in the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct.







Abstract
The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the 13C and 15N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions.

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;Zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13730-13738, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket mimicking the constrains induced by a proteic structure was probed by 1D EXSY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. Results highlight: i) the very high kinetic stability of a tetrahedral ZnII centre when coordination of a fifth ligand is precluded by the environment, ii) the necessary associative double&#8208;exchange mechanism for ligand exchange, and iii) the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing the exchange.







Abstract
In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic ZnII centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of ZnII in proteins.

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13840-13845, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The original molecular crystals containing cationic amphiphiles with azobenzene and disulfide groups showed different phase transitions depending on the application order of a reduction agent and light irradiation. The current molecular system can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.







Abstract
There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, molecular crystals were prepared that contained a cationic amphiphile bearing azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.

         <title>Electroresponsive Performances of Ecoresorbable Smart Fluids Consisting of Various Plant&#8208;Derived Carrier Liquids</title>

Vegetable and mineral: Ecoresorbable smart fluids consisting of various plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids and Mg&#8208;doped SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles exert superb electroresponsive properties with outstanding polarizability, wettability, and dispersion stability. By examining the performance of smart fluids composed of various oils, it is possible to provide deeper insights into the influence of medium on electroresponsive behavior. The proposed electrorheological fluids are nontoxic and can solve environmental problems.







Abstract
This paper proposes the fabrication of a new type of electrorheological (ER) fluid with ecoresorbable features as well as excellent electroresponsive performance. The proposed ER fluid consists of biocompatible Mg&#8208;doped silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (ST HNPs) suspended in vegetable oils (canola, grapeseed, olive, and soy). The effects of biodegradable plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids on the ER performance are analyzed. The polarizability and wettability of the fabricated ER fluids are studied. The high polarizability of the nanoparticles contributes to the highly electroresponsive performance by inducing electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles under electric fields; this enables the formation of a rigid and strong fibril structure. A suitable wettability, which represents the favorable interaction between the oil and the nanoparticles, allows the nanoparticles to disperse evenly in the oil and prevents their aggregation, thereby making the formation of a rigid and strong fibrillar structure under the electric field easier.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines through Aryne Three&#8208;Component Coupling</title>

Getting into position: Aryne multicomponent coupling triggered by pyridines allows the broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines bearing a &#8722;CF3 group by engaging &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be used as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway.







Abstract
The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol by using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated. The reaction allowed a broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives bearing the &#8722;CF3 group in good yields with &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway. Nucleophilic attack by the initially generated pyridylidene intermediate on the carbonyl followed by an SNAr process resembling the Smiles rearrangement affords the desired products.

         <title>Stepwise Stress&#8208;Induced Transformations of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedral Cluster&#8208;Based Assemblies: Where Conformational and Supramolecular Features Meet</title>

Squeezed to change: We demonstrate that a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered metal complex with remote phenyl rings can undergo reversible pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events.







Abstract
Understanding the factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity to the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergoing pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events. The observed phase transitions illustrate the key role of an interplay between the low&#8208;energy conformation perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.

Heterofullerene tailoring: The inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; bisadduct of azafullerene has been synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern, and 13C NMR spectroscopy showed C1 symmetry. The bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the enantiomers was probed by CD spectroscopy. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption and electrochemical data suggest that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct as compared to the equatorialface bisadduct.







Abstract
The multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C59N has been scarcely explored, and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral equatorialface bisadduct of C59N, we focused on the isolation of the first trans&#8208;4 bisadduct in a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the trans&#8208;4 bisadduct of C59N by using cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as a tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has C1 symmetry, as evidenced by 13C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; C59N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.

         <title>Ternary Hybrid Perovskite Solid Solution Single Crystals: Growth, Composition Determination and Phase Stability in Highly Moist Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13765-13773, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;centimeter&#8208;sized ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals have been grown. Wavelength disperse X&#8208;ray fluorescence is used as a quantitative elemental analysis method. The crystals with optimized composition show superior phase stability when they are stored in high&#8208;humidity environment for over two weeks, while those Cs&#8208;richer or Cs&#8208;poorer samples undergo various degrees of phase segregation induced by moisture.







Abstract
Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solutions have shown superior optoelectronic properties and better stability than their ABX3 simple perovskite counterparts under ambient conditions. However, crystal growth and identification of the accurate composition of these complex crystalline compounds remain challenging, and their stability under extreme conditions such as in highly moist atmosphere is unknown. Herein, large&#8208;size (up to 2&#8197;cm) single crystals of ternary perovskite 0.80FAPbI3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8242;FAPbBr3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;y&#8242;CsPbI3 (x&#8242;+y&#8242;=0.20) are grown. An elemental analysis method based on wavelength dispersive X&#8208;ray fluorescence is proposed to determine their accurate compositions. Among these single crystals, the composition with y&#8242;=0.12 shows the best moisture stability at 90&#8201;% relative humidity for 15&#8197;days. Other components with richer or poorer Cs+ ions undergo different phase segregation behaviours. The performance and stability of photodetectors based on these single crystals are tested. This work offers a deeper insight into phase stability of ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution crystals in highly moist atmosphere.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two-centimeter-sized ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals&lt;/b&gt; have been grown. Wavelength disperse X-ray fluorescence is used as a quantitative elemental analysis method. The crystals with optimized composition show superior phase stability when they are stored in high-humidity environment for over two weeks, while those Cs-richer or Cs-poorer samples undergo various degrees of phase segregation induced by moisture.

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13887-13893, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D on&#8208;surface assembly of isosteric phenazine derivatives was investigated by utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy on single&#8208;crystal gold, silver and copper surfaces. The strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerism were found to have a profound impact on the 2D assembly patterns, as evidenced by the variations in surface structure for the three derivative molecules used in this study.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives, DHP, DAP, and DBQD, to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While DHP exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies, DAP and DBQD show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.

         <title>Structure and Functional Differences of Cysteine and 3&#8208;Mercaptopropionate Dioxygenases: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13793-13806, October 1, 2021. </description>

Spheres of influence: Although cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase bind and react similar substrates, there are key differences in the first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination spheres that affect their catalytic reaction mechanism and reactivity, as highlighted by density functional theory studies on large enzyme clusters.







Abstract
Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health; they are involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine. As such, these enzymes have relevance to the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large, active&#8208;site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo&#8208;bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes in substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.

Breaking &#8216;hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill&#8217; bone cancer cells with gallium: Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) are linked to the poor prognosis of metastasised osteosarcoma. Here a gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complex is reported, containing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, diflunisal, capable of killing OSCs more effectively than frontline and secondary anti&#8208;osteosarcoma drugs. The complex evokes cell death by inhibiting cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series, 6 (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably, 6 exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that 6 downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore, 6 induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, 6 is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;Phase Structure</title>

Native mass spectrometry is now widely used in protein structural studies. We present a methodology for probing the importance of specific residues in the stabilization of compact protein structure in the gas&#8208;phase using a combination of chemical modification and collision induced unfolding ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.

         <title>Study of the Lithium Storage Mechanism of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Modified Cu2S Electrodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Ad LIB: In this study, thermal carbon reduction of CuS into Cu2S was monitored by high&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD). As LIB electrode material, Li+ storage intermediate Cu1.8S is confirmed by operando methods. The result shows that some original Cu2S remains unreacted after the first cycle, and carbon modification can improve the cycling stability of Cu2S for LIBs in the long&#8208;term cycle.







Abstract
Owing to their high specific capacity and abundant reserve, CuxS compounds are promising electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Carbon compositing could stabilize the CuxS structure and repress capacity fading during the electrochemical cycling, but the corresponding Li+ storage mechanism and stabilization effect should be further clarified. In this study, nanoscale Cu2S was synthesized by CuS co&#8208;precipitation and thermal reduction with polyelectrolytes. High&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction was used to monitor the thermal reduction process. During the first cycle, the conversion mechanism upon lithium storage in the Cu2S/carbon was elucidated by operando synchrotron radiation diffraction and in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;composited Cu2S (Cu2S/C) exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 425&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher, long&#8208;term capacity of 523&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles; in contrast, the bare CuS electrode exhibits 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. Multiple&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry proves that extra Li+ storage can mainly be ascribed to the contribution of the capacitive storage.

On a high: A series of phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;based fluorescent donor&#8211;acceptor molecules were designed and synthesized. They exhibited emissions ranging from green to red with high photoluminescence quantum yield in the solid state. These molecules also showed highly efficient electroluminescence at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application of any kind of light&#8208;emitting diode (LED). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP&#8208;, PIBzPCN&#8208;, and PIBzTPA&#8208;based devices showed EQEs of 8.27, 9.15, and 8.64&#8201;%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond</title>

Halogen bond&#8208;stabilized halonium ions are mild halenium transfer agents. The dependence of their reactivity on chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction has been evaluated using NMR, DFT and kinetics experiments. The mechanistic analysis of the transfer is expected to provide a handle in the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.







Abstract
[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]+ complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their 15N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.

Abstract
Combining different nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine&#8208;tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Here, 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4&#8208;triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3&#8208;(5&#8208;Amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) was designed and synthesized. Nitramino&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (6) and N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (7) were also obtained, and two series of corresponding nitrogen&#8208;rich salts were prepared, leading to the creation of new energetic compounds. All derivatives were fully characterized, and five of them were further confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials were studied. Compound 7 and its dihydroxylammonium salt (7&#8201;c) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to that of RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.

Among them, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(5-(5-(nitramino)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)nitramide and its dihydroxylammonium salt were screened as the most balanced energetic materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining different nitrogen-rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine-tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Here, 1,2,4-oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4-triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3-(5-Amino-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-amine (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) was designed and synthesized. Nitramino-functionalized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(5-(5-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)nitramide (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(5-(5-(nitramino)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)nitramide (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) were also obtained, and two series of corresponding nitrogen-rich salts were prepared, leading to the creation of new energetic compounds. All derivatives were fully characterized, and five of them were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4-triazole-1,2,4-oxadiazole-derived energetic materials were studied. Compound &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and its dihydroxylammonium salt (&lt;b&gt;7&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to that of RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>

Right Bipyramids. By separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow system, Pt right bipyramids containing one single twin plane were obtained in high yield.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br&#8722; ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.

Our role models and mentors are very important in our personal and professional development. However, in most cases, we do not spend enough time or pay enough attention choosing them. Herein, I explain how to select our role models and mentors, what characteristics they should have, and how to get the most out of them. Finally, I comment on the advantages of volunteering in an international scientific organization where you will find people with similar interests with whom to grow with purpose.







Abstract
Choosing the right mentors and role models has a profound impact in both our lives and professional careers; however, most often, not enough time or thought is given to this important decision. Because of that, we may miss some great opportunities and limit the potential benefits. In this invited contribution, I share my personal experience on nurturing the relationship with mentors and on choosing role models with my same values and a strong sense of service.

Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks: This review represents the progress made on the design principles and synthetic strategies for the construction of COFs and their composites for various energy applications such as different types of metal&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs), supercapacitors, water splitting (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER and oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and solar cells. Attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications. An understanding is developed of various strategies to tailor their performance towards desired applications, which will shed light on some possible modification aspects of COF structures with various conducting additives to greatly boost their properties.

A three&#8208;center halogen bond modulates the reactivity of a halonium ion and is thereby applicable for controlling the halogenation of alkenes. Chelation, strain, steric hindrance, and electrostatic interactions influence the halonium release rate. Combined experimental and theoretical analysis of the reaction mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and is expected to provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenation.

Mg&#8208;doped SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles and various plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids are used to make ecoresorbable electrorheological fluids. The particles are arranged perpendicular to the electrodes to form rigid fibril structures. The type of oil affects the wettability, resulting in differences in electrorheological performance and sedimentation behavior. The biocompatible smart fluids provide better commercial potential with diminishing concerns of environmental issues. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;Lee et&#8197;al.

         <title>Front Cover: A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;Zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins (Chem. Eur. J. 55/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13659-13659, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand&#8208;exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket was probed by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. These results are particularly relevant in the context of understanding the kinetic lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Bartik, O. Reinaud et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.20102184).

The understanding of multiple polymorphic phase transitions in molecular crystals is still in its infancy. With this in mind, single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were targeted at a polyhedral oxo cluster featuring phenyl rings in the outer sphere. Pressure evolution leads to a gradual relaxation of induced structural strains through stepwise conformational twisting of the phenyl rings with the reorganization of cooperative noncovalent interactions; this propagates the conformational isomerization. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak, J.&#8197;Lewi&#324;ski et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101732).

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>

Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) outline a resourceful illustration by uniting the remarkable properties of materials such as structural and chemical modulation, porosity and crystallinity, which can be productive for different types of metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting (Hydrogen evolution reaction, HER and Oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and solar cells.







Abstract
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of the crystalline porous materials family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.

         <title>Bifunctional Fluorophosphonium Triflates as Intramolecular Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Reversible CO2 Sequestration and Binding of Carbonyls, Nitriles and Acetylenes</title>

Extending the FLP library: Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl or imidazolyl substituents act as intramolecular N/P frustrated Lewis pairs that are capable of small molecule activation, that is, reversible CO2 sequestration and binding of carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes.







Abstract
Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl (3[OTf]) or imidazolyl (4[OTf])&#8208;substituents act as intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) and reversibly form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts with CO2 (5+ and 6+). An unusual and labile spirocyclic tetrahedral intermediate (72+) is observed in CO2&#8208;pressurized (0.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;bar) solutions of cation 4+ at low temperatures, as demonstrated by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies, which were confirmed crystallographically. In addition, cations 3+ and 4+ actively bind carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, as shown by selected examples.

Making a transfer: An iron&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic, biomimetic oxidation of various N&#8208;heterocycles by using the bifunctional hybrid catalyst Co(Salophen)&#8208;HQ as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) is reported. The reaction provides various important aromatic heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The dehydrogenation involves several electron&#8208;transfer steps that are inspired by biological oxidation processes in which molecular oxygen (O2) is used as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Herein, an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic oxidation of N&#8208;heterocycles under aerobic conditions is described. The dehydrogenation process, involving several electron&#8208;transfer steps, is inspired by oxidations occurring in the respiratory chain. An environmentally friendly and inexpensive iron catalyst together with a hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base hybrid catalyst as electron&#8208;transfer mediator were used for the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation reaction of various N&#8208;heterocycles. The method shows a broad substrate scope and delivers important heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.

         <title>Hexaphenylditetrels &#8211; When Longer Bonds Provide Higher Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13699-13702, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;Carbon bonds are exceptional as demonstrated for the hexaphenylditetrels where attractive London dispersion interactions are the decisive factor for the thermodynamic stabilities of tetrels other than carbon. Structural and energetic comparisons show that even though hexaphenylethane displays the largest dispersion energy between the two molecular halves, it has remained elusive because of even larger Pauli repulsion of the phenyl moieties that are forced in close contact due to the C&#8722;C bond that is the shortest in this series.







Abstract
We present a computational analysis of hexaphenylethane derivatives with heavier tetrels comprising the central bond. In stark contrast to parent hexaphenylethane, the heavier tetrel derivatives can readily be prepared. In order to determine the origin of their apparent thermodynamic stability against dissociation as compared to the carbon case, we employed local energy decomposition analysis (LED) and symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVP and sSAPT0/def2&#8208;TZVP levels of theory. We identified London dispersion (LD) interactions as the decisive factor for the molecular stability of heavier tetrel derivatives. This stability is made possible owing to the longer (than C&#8722;C) central bonds that move the phenyl groups out of the heavily repulsive regime so they can optimally benefit from LD interactions.

         <title>Agile Detection of Chemical Warfare Agents by Machine Vision: a Supramolecular Approach</title>

Smart(phone) recognition: A new fluorescent sensor able to interact noncovalently with DMMP, a CWA simulant, has been synthetized and tested both in solution and in the gas phase. The detection limit in solution is much lower than the toxicity values of CWAs; in the gas phase sensing can be performed on a simple smartphone. With acid/base treatment, the solid device can be reused. This prototype paves the way for the smart detection of nerve agents.







Abstract
The supramolecular detection by image analysis of a simulant chemical warfare agent on a solid device containing a selective molecular sensor based on a BODIPY scaffold is reported. The recognition properties were investigated in solution, demonstrating high affinity (log&#8201;K&#8197;6.60) and sensitivity (LOD 10&#8197;ppt). A test strip also confirmed the sensing properties in gas phase. Image analysis of the solid device allows quantitative information about the simulant to be obtained, recovering the sensor almost 5&#8197;times and thus confirming the goal of the supramolecular approach.

         <title>A Water Soluble Pd2L4 Cage for Selective Binding of Neu5Ac</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13719-13724, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that the cage binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied.







Abstract
The sialic acid N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its derivatives are involved in many biological processes including cell&#8208;cell recognition and infection by influenza. Molecules that can recognize Neu5Ac might thus be exploited to intervene in or monitor such events. A key obstacle in this development is the sparse availability of easily prepared molecules that bind to this carbohydrate in its natural solvent; water. Here, we report that the carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage 7. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that 7 binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied. Aided by molecular modeling, the selectivity for anionic carbohydrates such as Neu5Ac could be rationalized by the presence of charge assisted hydrogen bonds and/or the presence of a salt bridge with a guanidinium solubilizing arm of 7. Establishing that a simple coordination cage such as 7 can already selectively bind to Neu5Ac in water paves the way to improve the stability, affinity and/or selectivity properties of M2L4 cages for carbohydrates and other small molecules.

         <title>Diazophosphonates: Effective Surrogates for Diazoalkanes in Pyrazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 55, Page 13703-13708, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starring in a triple role&#8230; Diazophosphonates are excellent 1,3&#8208;dipoles in both inter&#8208; and intramolecular cycloadditions with alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles. The phosphoryl group has three key roles: its electron&#8208;withdrawing nature stabilizes the diazo compound, its unexploited propensity to migrate readily in sigmatropic rearrangements facilitates its transfer from C to N in the initial cycloadduct, and hence it is easily removed from the final pyrazole product.







Abstract
Diazophosphonates, readily prepared from &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates by oxidation of the corresponding hydrazones in batch or in flow, are useful partners in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles, including the first intramolecular examples of such a process. The phosphoryl group imbues a number of desirable properties into the diazo 1,3&#8208;dipole. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the phosphoryl stabilizes the diazo compound making it easier to handle, whilst the ability of the phosphoryl group to migrate readily in a [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enables its transfer from C to N to aromatize the initial cycloadduct, and hence its facile removal from the final pyrazole product. Overall, the diazophosphonate acts as a surrogate for the much less stable diazoalkane in cycloadditions, with the phosphoryl group playing a vital, but traceless, role. The cycloaddition proceeds more readily with alkynes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, and is regiospecific with asymmetrical alkynes. The potential of diazophosphonates for use in bioorthogonal cycloadditions is demonstrated by their facile addition to strained alkynes.

         <title>The Preparation of a Water&#8208;soluble Phospholate&#8208;based Macrocycle for Constructing Artificial Light&#8208;harvesting Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the basis of cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene ( CTX ), a novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based CTX derivative ( WPCTX ) was prepared with facile synthetic procedure and satisfying yield. Several model guest molecules were selected to investigate WPCTX 's host&#8208;guest properties. Based on the study of the host and model guest complexation, a tetraphenylethylene derivative from model guest was employed as a guest molecule ( G ) to form WPCTX &#8835; G nanoparticles (NPs) with WPCTX through further supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in water. Moreover, the hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Eosin Y ( ESY ) or Nile red ( NiR ), was encapsulated in WPCTX &#8835; G NPs, respectively, to construct two types of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems. Their high antenna effect demonstrated such NPs successfully mimicked light&#8208;harvesting system in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox isomerization/(3 + 2) allenoate annulation by auto&#8208;tandem phosphine catalysis.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine catalyzed approach to pyrrolines has been developed that involves two mechanistically unlinked catalytic processes. The first involves the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to provide access to aliphatic tosyl imines, which then engage in a (3 + 2) annulation with various allenoates. The reaction shows generality, with 24 examples established, along with a low yielding and moderately enantioselective variant. Mechanistic studies indicate that the viability of the process is linked to the selection of catalysts with similar propensity to add to the two coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>The Roles of Composition and Mesostructure of Cobalt&#8208;based Spinel Catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the crystalline precursor decomposition approach and direct co&#8208;precipitation the composition and mesostructure of cobalt&#8208;based spinels can be controlled. A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox&#8208;active iron and redox&#8208;inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co  3  O  4  , MgCo  2  O  4  , Co  2  FeO  4  , Co  2  AlO  4  and CoFe  2  O  4  . The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H  2  O  2  decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co  3  O  4  and CoFe  2  O  4  catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogs. For CAN&#8208;test and OER, Co  3+  plays the major role for high activity. In H  2  O  2  decomposition, Co  2+  reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions. A benefit of a predominant 111 surface termination depends on the cobalt oxidation state in the as&#8208;prepared catalysts and the investigated reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Boundaries between Lewis&#8208;Basic and Redox Behavior of a Parent Borylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parent borylene (CAAC)(Me3P)BH,  1  (CAAC = cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene), acts both as a Lewis base and one&#8208;electron reducing agent towards group 13 trichlorides (ECl3  , E = B, Al, Ga, In), yielding the adducts  1&#8208;ECl  3  and increasing proportions of the radical cation  [1]  &#8226;+  for the heavier group 13 analogues. With boron trihalides (BX3, X = F, Cl, Br, I)  1  undergoes sequential adduct formation and halide abstraction reactions to yield borylboronium cations and shows an increasing tendency towards redox processes for the heavier halides. Calculations confirm that  1  acts as a strong Lewis base towards EX3  and show a marked increase in the B&#8211;E bond dissociation energies down both group 13 and the halide group.</dc:description>

         <title>A Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of higher alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is an important reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals with added value. Though the process for primary alcohol oxidation is industrially established, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding considering the complexity of the catalysts and their dynamics under reaction conditions, especially when higher alcohols and liquid&#8208;phase reaction media are involved. Additionally, new materials should be developed offering higher activity, selectivity, and stability. This can be achieved by unraveling the structure&#8210;performance correlations of these catalysts under reaction conditions. In this regard, researchers are encouraged to develop more advanced characterization techniques to address the complex interplay between the solid surface, the dissolved reactants, and the solvent. In this mini&#8208;review, we report some of the most important approaches taken in the field and give a perspective on how to tackle the complex challenges for different approaches in alcohol oxidation while providing insight into the remaining challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Control of Perylene Supramolecular Polymers through Imide Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number and type of new supramolecular polymer (SMP) systems have increased rapidly in recent years. Some of the key challenges faced for these novel systems include gaining full control over the mode of self&#8208;assembly, the creation of novel architectures and exploring functionality. Here we provide a critical overview of approaches related to perylene&#8208;based SMPs and discuss progress to exert control over these potentially important SMPs through chemical modification of the imide substituents. Imide substitutions affect self&#8208;assembly behaviour orthogonally to the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of the perylene core, making for a valuable approach to tune SMP properties. Several recent approaches are therefore highlighted, with a focus on controlling 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208; aggregation, and 3) mechanism of growth and degree of aggregation using thermodynamic and kinetic control. Areas of potential future exploration and application of these functional SMPs are also explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid, highly reactive and stable DOTA&#8208;like tags containing a thiol&#8208;specific phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety for protein modification and NMR analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site specific labeling of paramagnetic NMR tags generate valuable structural restraints such as pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) that can be used to characterize structures, interactions and dynamics of protein&#8208;ligand or nucleic acid complexes. Herein, two single&#8208;armed DOTA&#8208;like tags, BrPSPy&#8208;DO3M(  S  )A&#8208;Ln and BrPSPy&#8208;6M&#8208;DO3M(  S  )A&#8208;Ln, each containing a thiol&#8208;specific reacting group, phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety, are demonstrated as rigid, reactive and stable paramagnetic tags for protein labeling by formation of a reductive resistant thiol&#8208;ether bond between the protein and the tag. The introduction of Br neighboring the 4&#8208;phenylsulfone group in pyridine enhances the reactivity towards the solvent exposed thiol group in a protein, whereas the methyl group in the sixth position in pyridine increases the rigidity of the tag in the protein conjugates. The high performance and tunable reactivity and rigidity of these two tags can be added in the toolbox of paramagnetic tags suitable for the high&#8208;resolution measurements of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton Coupling in Redox&#8208;Active Salen based Self&#8208;Assembled Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of a redox&#8208;active nickel salen complex into supramolecular structures was explored via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with homobimetallic ruthenium complexes (bridged by oxalato or 5,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinato ligands). The self&#8208;assembly resulted in the formation of a discrete rectangle using the oxalato complex and either a rectangle or a catenane employing the larger naphthoquinonato complex. The formation of the interlocked self&#8208;assembly was determined to be solvent and concentration dependent. The electronic structure and stability of the oxidized metallacycles was probed using electrochemical experiments, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, confirming ligand radical formation. Exciton coupling of the intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) ligand radical intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) bands provided further confirmation of the geometric and electronic structures in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Surface Curvature in Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive consumption of fossil fuels has caused unavoidable environmental problems. The development of renewable and clean alternatives is essential for the sustainable and green development of human society. Electrocatalysts are most important parts in these energy&#8208;related devices. Recently, scientists found that the surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for the improvement of catalytic performance and the optimization of intrinsic catalytic activity during electrocatalytic process. The role of surface curvature in electrocatalysts is still under investigating. In this minireview, we summarized the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy&#8208;related applications. This review mainly involves the strategies for preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, three typical electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures (curled surface, onion&#8208;like structure, and spiral structure), and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Dynamic Covalent Architectures by Multivalence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of imine bond is reversible. This feature has been taken advantage of by chemists for accomplishing high yielding self&#8208;assembly. On the other hand, it also jeopardizes the intrinsic stability of these self&#8208;assembled products. However, some recent discoveries demonstrate that some of these imine bond containing molecules could be rather stable or kinetically inert. A deep investigation indicated that such enhanced stability results from, at least partially, multivalence. Such results also inspire chemists to use imine condensation for self&#8208;assembly in water, a solvent that is considered not compatible with imine bond for a long time.</dc:description>

         <title>Presodiation Strategies for the Promotion of Sodium&#8208;Based Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years lots of progress has been made in the field of presodiation, herein we provide a schematic overview of presodiation in Na&#8208;based energy storage systems, illustrating various strategies to compensate for irreversible sodium loss as well as other functions.







Abstract
Nowadays sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems (Na&#8208;based ESSs) have been widely researched as it possesses the possibility to replace traditional energy storage media to become next generation energy storage system. However, due to the irreversible loss of sodium ions in the first cycle, development of Na&#8208;based ESSs is limited. Presodiation, as a strategy of adding excess sodium ions to the system in advance, accomplishes the enhancement of electrochemical performance. In this minireview, different presodiation strategies applied in sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems will be summarized in detail, their functions and corresponding mechanisms will be discussed as well. Furthermore, the current novel application of presodiation method in other aspects of Na&#8208;based ESSs will be mentioned additionally. At last, in the view of present research status of presodiation, issues that can be mitigated are put forward and guidelines are given on how to deliberate in&#8208;depth presodiation technology in the future, dedicating to promote the further development of Na&#8208;based ESSs.

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silica gardens are self&#8208;assembled tubular precipitates formed by a combination of osmosis, buoyancy, and chemical reaction, and thought to be capable of catalyzing prebiotic condensation reactions. In many cases, the tube wall is a bilayer structure with the properties of a diaphragm and/or a membrane. The interest of silica gardens in materials science as microreactors has increased over the past decade because of their ability to create long&#8208;lasting electrochemical potential. In this study, we have grown single macroscopic tubes based on calcium carbonate and monitored their time&#8208;dependent behavior by in&#8208;situ measurements of pH, ionic concentrations inside and outside the tubular membranes, and electrochemical potential differences. Further, we have characterized the composition and structure of the tubular membranes by using ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Based on the collected data, we propose a physicochemical mechanism for the formation and ripening of these peculiar CaCO  3  structures and compare the results to those of other chemical garden systems. We find that the wall of the macroscopic calcium carbonate tubes is a bilayer of texturally distinct but compositionally similar calcite showing high crystallinity. The resulting high density of the material prevents macroscopic calcium carbonate gardens to develop significant electrochemical potential differences. In the light of these observations, possible implications in materials science and prebiotic (geo)chemistry are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonheme Iron Imido Complexes Bearing a Non&#8208;Innocent Ligand: A Synthetic Chameleon Species in Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;imido complexes can perform C&#8211;H activation and sulfimidation reactions, but are far less studied than the more ubiquitous iron&#8208;oxo species. As case studies, we have looked at a recently published iron(V)&#8208;imido ligand &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex, which is formally an iron(VI)&#8208;imido complex [Fe  V  (NTs)(TAML  +&#183;  )] (  1  ; NTs = tosylimido), and an iron(V)&#8208;imido complex [Fe  V  (NTs)(TAML)]  &#8208;  (  2  ). Using a theoretical approach, we found that they have multiple energetically close&#8208;lying electromers, sometimes even without changing spin states, reminiscent of the so&#8208;called Compound I in Cytochrome P450. When studying their reactivity theoretically, it is indeed found that their electronic structures may change to perform efficient oxidations, emulating the multi&#8208;spin state reactivity in Fe  IV  O systems. This is actually in contrast to the known [Fe  V  (O)(TAML)]  &#8208;  species (  3  ), where the reactions occur only on the ground spin state. We also looked into the whole reaction pathway for the C&#8211;H bond activation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene by these intermediates to reproduce the experimentally observed products, including steps that usually attract no interest (neither theoretically nor experimentally) due to their non&#8208;rate&#8208;limiting status and fast reactivity. A new &#8220;clustering non&#8208;rebound mechanism&#8221; is presented for this C&#8211;H activation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy and High Efficiency Light&#8208;driven Hydrogen Evolution of a {Mo3S4}&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based System</title>

         <dc:description>Abstract:  Polyoxothiometalate ions (ThioPOM) are active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts based on modular assembly build from electrophilic clusters {MoS  x  } and vacant polyoxotungstates. Herein, the dumbbell&#8208;like anion [{(PW  11  O  39  )Mo  3  S  4  (H  2  O)  3  (OH)}  2  ]  8&#8208;  exhibits very high light&#8208;driven HER activity while the active cores {Mo  3  S  4  } do not contain any exposed disulfido ligands which were suspected at the origin of the HER activity. Moreover, in the catalyst architecture, the two central {Mo  3  S  4  } cores are sandwiched by two {PW  11  O  39  }  7&#8208;  subunits that act as oxidant resistant protecting groups and behave as electron&#8208;collecting units. A detailed photophysical study was carried out confirming the reductive quenching mechanism of the photosensitizer [Ir(ppy)  2  (dtbbpy)]  +  by the sacrificial donor triethanolamine (TEOA) and highlighting the very high rate constant of the electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the ThioPOM catalyst. Such results provide new insights in the field of molecular catalytic systems able to promote high HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Radical Desaturation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site&#8208;selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N&#8208;radical generates a translocated C&#8208;radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag&#8208;couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Cyclohexene Oxidation with O2 over Spray&#8208;Flame&#8208;Synthesized La1&#8208;xSrxCoO3 Perovskite Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>La  1&#8208;x  Sr  x  CoO  3  (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8209;flame synthesis and applied in liquid&#8209;phase oxidation of cyclohexene using molecular O  2  as oxidant under mild conditions. The catalysts were systematically characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques. With increasing Sr content, the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects increases, which is beneficial for cyclohexene oxidation, but the surface concentration of less active Co  2+  was also increased. However, Co  2+  cations have a superior activity towards peroxide decomposition, which also plays an important role in cyclohexene oxidation. A Sr&#8209;doping of 20&#160;at.% was found to be the optimum in terms of activity and product selectivity. It also showed excellent reusability over three catalytic runs, which can be attributed to its highly stable particle size and morphology. Kinetic investigations revealed first&#8209;order reaction kinetics for temperatures between 60 and 100&#160;&#176;C and an apparent activation energy of 68&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8208;1  for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the reaction was not affected by the applied O  2  pressure in the range from 10 to 20 bar.  In situ  attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion of cyclohexene and the formation of reaction products including the key intermediate 2&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;hydroperoxide, while spin trap electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided strong evidence for a radical reaction pathway by identifying the cyclohexenyl alkoxyl radical.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of a cobalt&#8208;dioxolene core that exhibits valence tautomerism (VT) with pyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid functionalized with the chains bearing two, four, or six oxyethylene units led to new complexes  Co  n  EGEspy  (  n  = 2, 4, and 6). These complexes commonly form violet crystals of the  low&#8208;spin  (  ls  )&#8208;[Co  III  (  n  EGEspy)  2  (3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)(3,6&#8208;DTBCat)] (  ls  &#8208;[Co  III  ], 3,6&#8208;DTBSQ = 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl semiquinonato, 3,6&#8208;DTBCat = 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl catecholato). Interestingly, violet crystals of  Co2EGEspy  in the  ls  &#8208;[Co  III  ] transitioned into a green liquid, accompanied by an almost complete VT shift (94%) to the  high&#8208;spin  (  hs  )&#8208;[Co  II  (  n  EGEspy)  2  (3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)  2  ] (  hs  &#8208;[Co  II  ]) upon melting. In contrast, violet crystals of  Co4EGEspy  and  Co6EGEspy  in the  ls  &#8208;[Co  III  ] exhibited partial VT (33%) and only a 9.3% VT shift after melting, respectively.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C 6 H 4 P 2 BPh] 2&#8211; ( 1 2&#8208; ), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C 6 H 4 {PH 2 }) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 1 2&#8208; , which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951; 5 &#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO) 3 (&#951; 5 &#8208; 1 )}{&#956;&#8208;&#951; 1 &#8208;Mo(CO) 3 (TMEDA)} 2 ].[Li(THF)][Li(TMEDA)].</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoS  x  hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45 min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. The results indicated that a fused indoline produced by photochemical intramolecular d&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. Since this substrate has an aminal skeleton, racemization involving a ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing equilibrium process occurred under suitable conditions. Efficient racemization was observed in acetone containing a catalytic base, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). Crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization by Viedma ripening from racemic indoline was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99% ee. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of the indoline was achieved by the photochemical reaction of achiral phthalimide followed by continuous attrition&#8208;enhanced deracemization converging to 99% ee of enantiomeric crystals. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by photochemical hydrogen abstraction and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Study in Red: The Overlooked Role of Azo&#8208;Moieties in Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Strongly Extended Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique optical and photoredox properties of heptazine&#8208;based polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials make them promising semiconductors for driving various productive photocatalytic conversions. However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430&#8208;450 nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting.  Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450 nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high&#8208;temperature (900 &#176;C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de&#8208;ammonification leads to the formation of azo&#8208;groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible&#8208;light (470 nm) for H  2  evolution even without any additional co&#8208;catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge&#8208;trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N &#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99.5% ee ) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers have been extensively studied in recent years. Some of these materials can exhibit several properties such as permanent porosity, high surface area, thermostability and light emission, as well as open sites for chemical functionalization. Concerning the fact that this kind of compounds are usually solids, the size and morphology of the particles are important parameters when an application is desired. Inside this context, there is a subclass of coordination polymers, named Infinite Coordination Polymers (ICPs), which auto&#8208;organize as micro&#8208; or nanoparticles with low crystallinity. Specifically, the particles exhibiting spherical shapes and reduced sizes can be better dispersed, enter cells much easier than bulk crystals and be converted to inorganic materials by topotactic transformation. Luminescent ICPs, in particular, can find applications in several areas, such as sensing probes, light&#8208;emitting devices and bioimaging. In this review, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of ICP&#8208;based spherical particles, including the growth mechanisms, some applications for luminescent ICPs and the challenges to overcome in future commercial usage of these materials.</dc:description>

The majority of presented compounds were produced in the context of project A3 &#8220;Di&#8208; to tetranuclear compounds incorporating highly anisotropic paramagnetic metal ions&#8221; within the SFB/TRR88 &#8220;3MET&#8221;. These contain {FeIII2Ln2} cores encapsulated in ligand shells which are easy to tune in a &#8220;test&#8208;bed&#8221; system. We identify the following advantages and variables in such systems: (i) the complexes are structurally simple usually with one crystallographically independent FeIII and LnIII, respectively. This simplifies theory and anaylsis; (ii) choosing Fe allows 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to be used as an additional technique which can give information about oxidation levels and spin states, local moments at the iron nuclei and spin&#8208;relaxation and, more importantly, about the anisotropy not only of the studied isotope, but also of elements interacting with this isotope; (iii) isostructural analogues with all the available (i.e. not Pm) 4f ions can be synthesised, enabling a systematic survey of the influence of the 4f ion on the electronic structure; (iv) this cluster type is obtained by reacting [FeIII3O(O2CR)6(L)3](X) (X = anion, L = solvent such as H2O, py) with an ethanolamine&#8208;based ligand L&#8217; and lanthanide salts. This allows to study analogues of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(L&#8217;)2(O2CR)6] using the appropriate iron trinuclear starting materials. (v) the organic main ligand can be readily functionalised, facilitating a systematic investigation of the effect of organic substituents on the ligands on the magnetic properties of the complexes. We describe and discuss 34 {MIII2Ln2} (M = Fe or in one case Al) butterfly compounds which have been reported up to 2020. The analysis of these gives perspectives for designing new SMM systems with specific electronic and magnetic signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation of mechanical properties of polymer materials with those of their molecular constituents is the foundation for their holistic comprehension and eventually for improved material designs and syntheses. Over the last decade, optical force probes (OFPs) were developed, shedding light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials. The properties of polymers are diverse, ranging from soft hydrogels to ultra&#8208;tough composites, from purely elastic rubbers to viscous colloidal solutions, and from transparent glasses to super black dyed coatings. Only very recently, researchers started to develop tailored OFP solutions that account for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. We here highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Slow&#8208;Magnetic Relaxation in Pristine Ferrocenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the spin dynamic properties of non&#8208;substituted ferrocenium complexes. Ferrocenium shows a field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in DMF solution while cobaltocene lacks of slow spin relaxation neither in powder nor in solution. Multireference quantum mechanical calculations give a non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation for ferrocenium with small first excitation energy that agrees with the relatively large measured magnetic anisotropy for a transition metal S=1/2 system. The analysis of the spin relaxation shows an important participation of quantum tunnelling, Raman, direct and local&#8208;mode mechanisms which depend on temperature and the external field conditions. The calculation of spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants for the vibrational modes shows that the first vibrational mode, despite having a low spin&#8208;phonon constant, is the most efficient process for the spin relaxation at low temperatures. In such conditions, vibrational modes with higher spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants are not populated. Additionally, the vibrational energy of this first mode is in excellent agreement with the experimental fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Glucocerebrosidase Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited deficiencies in &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Current treatments require rapid disease diagnosis and a means of monitoring therapeutic efficacy, both of which may be supported by the use of GBA&#8208;targeting activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). Here, we report the synthesis and structural analysis of a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs for GBA. We demonstrate their covalent mechanism&#8208;based mode of action and uncover binding of the new  N&#8208;  functionalised aziridines to the ligand binding cleft. These inhibitors became scaffolds for the development of ABPs; the O6&#8208;fluorescent tags of which bind in an allosteric site at the dimer interface. Considering GBA&#8217;s preference for O6&#8208; and  N  &#8208;functionalised reagents, we synthesised a bi&#8208;functional aziridine ABP which we hoped would offer a more powerful imaging agent. Whilst this ABP binds to two unique active site clefts of GBA, no further benefit in potency was achieved over our first generation ABPs. Nevertheless, such ABPs should serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to GD and inform the design of future probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reactions of thiophenolates with geminal bis(acceptor)&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in DMSO at 20 &#176;C was monitored by photometric methods. The determined second&#8208;order rate constants of the S  N  2 reactions followed linear relationships with Mayr nucleophilicity parameters (  N  /  s  N  ) and Br&#248;nsted basicities (p  K  aH  ) of the thiophenolates as well as with Hammett substituent parameters (&#963;) for groups attached to the thiophenolates. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted by up to a factor of 15 faster than their unsubstituted analogues, in accord with the known activating effect of adjacent &#960;&#8208;systems in S  N  2 reactions. Variation of electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, inherent S  N  2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;systems because of more advanced C1&#8208;C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, also electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Carbonyl and iminyl based radical anions are reactive intermediates in a variety of transformations in organic synthesis. Herein, the isolation of ketyl, and more importantly unprecedented ketiminyl and aldiminyl radical anions coordinated to cobalt and iron complexes is presented.

         <dc:description>The aromatic metallole dianions are important metallaaromatic compounds because of their various reactivities and extensive synthetic applications. Herein we report the reactions of dilithionickelole with MgCl  2  , EtAlCl  2  , Cp*ScCl  2  , Cp*LuCl  2  and Pt(COD)Cl  2  (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) affording a series of Ni/M heterobimetallic complexes of the general formula (  &#951;  4  &#8208;C  4  R  4  M)Ni(COD), in which the metalloles act as diene ligands, as suggested by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray, NMR and theoretical analyses. In these reactions, two electrons of the nickelole dianion transferred to Ni, representing different reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions.</dc:description>

         <title>Full&#8208;Atom Model of the Agonist LPS&#8208;bound Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 Dimer in a Membrane Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The innate immunity TLR4/MD&#8208;2 system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We here combine  ab&#8208;initio  calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies reveal functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular TIR domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)  2  architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Stabilised [SbF4]+: SbF5 as a Fluoride&#8208;Ion Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8211; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8211;N = bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#183;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2. The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;3CH3CN and [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;2SO2 were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations. DFT calculations and NBO analyses reveal that significant degree of electron&#8208;pair donation from N to Sb stabilizes [SbF4]+ with the Sb&#8211;N bond strength being ca. &#160;of that of the Sb&#8211;F bonds in these cations and the cationic charge being primarily ligand&#8208;centred.</dc:description>

         <title>Elastic organic crystals based on barbituric derivative: multifaceted bending and flexible optical waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multifaceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative  DBDT  , which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH  3  OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (  H  ) and elastic modulus (  E  ) were 0.28 &#177; 0.01 GPa and 4.56 &#177; 0.03 GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O) and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627 nm were 0.7 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 0.9 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 1.8 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state) at 567 nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Prospect and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein, we summarize the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Then, we also introduce the recent new insight about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High Fidelity Enzyme&#8208;Free Primer Extension with an Ethynylpyridone Thymidine Analog</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High fidelity base pairing is important for the transmission of genetic information. Weak base pairs can lower fidelity, complicating sequencing, amplification and replication of DNA.&#160; Thymidine 5'&#8208;monophosphate (TMP) is the most weakly pairing nucleotide among the canonical deoxynucleotides, causing high errors rates in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. &#160;Here we report the synthesis of an ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside analog of 3'&#8208;amino&#8208;2',3'&#8208;dideoxythymidine monophosphate and its incorporation in a growing strand by enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. The ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleotide accelerates extension more than five&#8208;fold, reduces misincorporation and readily displaces TMP in competition experiments. The results bode well for the use of the  C  &#8208;nucleoside as replacements for thymidine in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension &#8211; a facile path to extended perylenes and terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new method of synthesis of extended perylenes and terrylenes. The technique is based on the cascade dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) of aryl aldehydes, where stepwise annulations activate previously &#8220;dormant&#8221; substituents. Two&#8208;fold and four&#8208;fold cyclizations of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehydes offer a rapid path to unsymmetrical perylenes and elusive terrylene derivatives, respectively. DPEX of 3,3''&#8208;(phenanthrene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl)bis (([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)) leads to the biradical structure, which in situ proceeds into oxidative electrocyclization at room temperature. The described domino process complements and expands DPEX approach to a large family of fused acenes and related PAHs.</dc:description>
