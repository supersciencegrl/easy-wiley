         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Terpenoid Alkaloid&#8211;like Compounds Containing Medium&#8208;sized Rings via Reconstruction of the Humulene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of a chemical library based on natural products is a promising method for the synthesis of natural product&#8211;like compounds. In this study, we synthesized a terpenoid alkaloid&#8211;like compound library based on the humulene skeleton. Our strategy, which enables access to diverse ring systems such as 11&#8208;membered monocyclic, oxabicyclic, and medium&#8208;sized aza ring&#8211;containing scaffolds, involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom, an intermolecular C&#8211;O bond formation via Lewis acid&#8211;mediated epoxide&#8208;opening transannulation, and a ring&#8208;reconstruction strategy based on olefin metathesis. A cheminformatics analysis based on their structural and physicochemical properties revealed that the synthesized compounds have high three&#8208;dimensionality and high natural product likeness scores but with structural novelty. The usefulness of the terpenoid alkaloid&#8211;like compound library for drug discovery and the accessibility to structure&#8211;activity relationship studies were validated by performing an assay for osteoclast&#8208;specific tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase activity, resulting in the identification of a lead compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases such as osteoporosis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The confinement and high utilization of sulfur in the cathodes is critical for improved cycling performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this case one&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951 mAhg&#8208;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C with a low fading rate of 0.062% per cycle. The excellent cycling performance is correlated with highly oxidized MXene and in situ formed sulfate/thiosulfate complex layer in the long&#8208;term cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination/Dearomatization of C6F5 Groups: An FLP Route to an Electrophilic Borane and Non&#8208;Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic fluorination and de&#8208;aromatization of C6F5 rings in boranes and borate derivatives is achieved using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. Thus, the anions [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, and borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are reported.







Abstract
B(C6F5)3 and the corresponding anion [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; are ubiquitous in main group and transition metal chemistry. Known derivatives are generally limited to the incorporation of electron donating substituents. Herein we describe electrophilic fluorination and dearomatization of such species using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. In this fashion the anions [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and [(C6F5)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, are converted to [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, respectively. Similarly, the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are produced. These rare examples of electrophilic attack of electron deficient rings proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair effecting fluorination and dearomatization of C6F5 rings.

         <title>A Monometallic Bis(cyaphido) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(cyaphido) complex is achieved for the first time, demonstrating the viability of incorporating multiple cyaphido ligands at one metal center. Comparison with the heteroleptic C&#8801;N/C&#8801;P analogue offers the first direct experimental comparison of cyaphide with cyanide. A degree of cooperative delocalization within the bis(cyaphido) complex illustrates the cyaphido ligand exhibiting some &#960;&#8208;donor, in addition to its &#960;&#8208;acceptor, character.







Abstract
The first example of a bis(cyaphido) complex, trans&#8208;[Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;P)2], is described, unequivocally demonstrating the synthetic accessibility and stability of complexes that feature more than one cyaphido ligand. Synthesis is achieved from the precedent cation [Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;P)]+ via sequential coordination and desilylation of the phosphaalkyne Me3SiC&#8801;P. The heteroleptic analogue trans&#8208;[Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;N)(C&#8801;P)] is also prepared from the same cation and NaCN; both cyaphido complexes are structurally characterized, enabling the first direct comparison of cyaphide with cyanide, its isoelectronic and isolobal counterpart. This demonstrates an enhanced &#960;&#8208;acidity for &#8722;C&#8801;P over &#8722;C&#8801;N, while computational studies reveal also a higher &#960;&#8208;donor character for the cyaphido ligand.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of a bis(cyaphido) complex, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Ru(dppe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], is described, unequivocally demonstrating the synthetic accessibility and stability of complexes that feature more than one cyaphido ligand. Synthesis is achieved from the precedent cation [Ru(dppe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; via sequential coordination and desilylation of the phosphaalkyne Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC&#8801;P. The heteroleptic analogue &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Ru(dppe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;N)(C&#8801;P)] is also prepared from the same cation and NaCN; both cyaphido complexes are structurally characterized, enabling the first direct comparison of cyaphide with cyanide, its isoelectronic and isolobal counterpart. This demonstrates an enhanced &#960;-acidity for &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8801;P over &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8801;N, while computational studies reveal also a higher &#960;-donor character for the cyaphido ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Complete Assessment of Small Molecule and Peptidomimetic Inhibitors of Sortase A Towards Antivirulence Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA), where it is considered as a major target for antivirulence therapy. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells and are considered major virulence factors. Currently, many promising approaches to target SrtA are available, including naturally derived and synthetic small molecule inhibitors as well as peptidomimetic inhibitors, based on the SrtA recognition sequence.







Abstract
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA). Sortase A (SrtA) is a critical virulence factor, present ubiquitously in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria of which many are pathogenic. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells, by anchoring extracellular matrix&#8208;binding proteins to the bacterial outer cell wall. By targeting virulence factors, effective treatment can be achieved, without inducing antibiotic resistance to the treatment. This is a potentially more sustainable, long&#8208;term approach to treating bacterial infections, including ones that display multiple resistance to current therapeutics. There are many promising approaches available for SrtA inhibition, some of which have the potential to advance into further clinical development, with peptidomimetic and in&#8197;vivo active small molecules being among the most promising. There are currently no approved drugs on the market targeting SrtA, despite its promise, adding to the relevance of this review article, as it extends to the pharmaceutical industry additionally to academic researchers.

         <title>Unlocking Photocatalytic Activity of Acridinium Salts by Anion&#8208;Binding Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merge of anion&#8208;binding and photoredox catalysis for the modular, in&#8197;situ photocatalytic activation of acridinium salts is reported. This approach leads to an enhancement of the stability and selectivity of the photoactive ion pair species, which proved effective to promote several visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox reactions.







Abstract
The in&#8197;situ generation of active photoredox organic catalysts upon anion&#8208;binding co&#8208;catalysis by making use of the ionic nature of common photosensitizers is reported. Hence, the merge of anion&#8208;binding and photocatalysis permitted the modulation of the photocatalytic activity of simple acridinium halide salts, building an effective anion&#8208;binding &#8211; photoredox ion pair complex able to promote a variety of visible light driven transformations, such as anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to olefins, Diels&#8208;Alder and the desilylative C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Anion&#8208;binding studies, together with steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy analysis, supported the postulated ion pair formation between the thiourea hydrogen&#8208;bond donor organocatalyst and the acridinium salt, which proved essential for unlocking the photocatalytic activity of the photosensitizer.

         <title>Stable CAAC&#8208;Triazenes: A New Nitrogen Ligand System With Donor and Conformational Flexibility, and With Application in Olefin Activation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusually stable: Triazenes stabilized with a cyclic (amino)(alkyl)carbene are readily accessible, remarkably stable towards thermal N2 loss and undergo partially reversible E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization. They offer a large &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and through all three nitrogens and, when used as ligand to palladium, impart high catalytic activity in olefin oligomerization and double bond migration.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic imines such as pyridylidene amines impart high catalytic activity when coordinated to a transition metal, largely imposed by their electronic flexibility. Here, this donor flexibility has been applied for the first time to CAAC&#8208;based systems through the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;triazenes. These new ligands offer a larger &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene through three nitrogens rather than just one, as observed in N&#8208;heterocyclic imines. We demonstrate the straightforward synthesis of three new CAAC&#8208;triazenes containing different substituents on the terminal triazene nitrogen. These compounds are remarkably stable up to 120&#8201;&#176;C without loss of N2 as typically observed with similar triazenes. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization within the triazene is instigated by UV light and is partially reversible dependent on the triazene substituent. The quinoline&#8208;substituted CAAC&#8208;triazene 1&#8208;Q has been applied as an L,L&#8217;&#8208;type ligand in the synthesis of [PdCl2(1&#8208;Q)], [PdCl(Me)(1&#8208;Q)] and [Pd(Me)(H2O(1&#8208;Q)]+. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z ligand isomerization also occurs when coordinated to PdCl2, providing access to on&#8208;metal manipulation. The cationic complex [PdMe(H2O)(1&#8208;Q)]+ is a precatalyst for oligomerization of ethylene to form initially 2&#8208;butene and subsequently linear and branched C8&#8722;C12 products from butene activation. Moreover, isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene takes place efficiently with exceptionally low catalyst loading (10&#8197;ppm) and up to 74,000 turnover numbers.

         <title>An Efficient and Scalable &#8220;Second Generation&#8221; Total Synthesis of the Marine Polyketide Limaol Endowed with Antiparasitic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The apparently non&#8208;thermodynamic cluster of skipped exo&#8208;methylene substituents on the &#8220;northern&#8221; wing of limaol is not the Achilles heel of this unique dinoflagellate&#8208;derived marine natural product; rather, the proper choice of protecting groups on the spiroketal core proved to be key for an efficient synthesis. In consideration thereof, a &#8220;second generation&#8221; synthesis was devised that is practical, robust, efficient and scalable.







Abstract
The cluster of four skipped exo&#8208;methylene substituents on the &#8220;northern&#8221; wing of limaol renders this dinoflagellate&#8208;derived marine natural product unique in structural terms. This arguably non&#8208;thermodynamic array gains kinetic stability by virtue of populating local conformations which impede isomerization to a partly or fully conjugated polyene. This analysis suggested that the difficulties encountered during the late stages of our first total synthesis of this polyketide had not been caused by an overly fragile character of this unusual substructure; rather, an unfavorable steric microenvironment about the spirotricyclic core was identified as the likely cause. To remedy the issue, the protecting groups on this central fragment were changed; in effect, this amendment allowed all strategic and practical problems to be addressed. As a result, the overall yield over the longest linear sequence was multiplied by a factor of almost five and the material throughput increased more than eighty&#8208;fold per run. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success was a gold&#8208;catalyzed spirocyclization reaction; the reasons why a Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalyst is needed and the origin of the excellent levels of selectivity were delineated. The change of the protecting groups also allowed for much improved fragment coupling processes; most notably, the sequence of a substrate&#8208;controlled carbonyl addition reaction followed by Mitsunobu inversion that had originally been necessary to affix the southern tail to the core could be replaced by a reagent controlled asymmetric allylation. Finally, a much&#8208;improved route to the &#8220;northern&#8221; sector was established by leveraging the power of asymmetric hydrogenation of a 2&#8208;pyrone derivative. Limaol was found to combine appreciable antiparasitic activity with very modest cytotoxicity.

         <title>Synthesis and Performance of Bio&#8208;Based Amphoteric Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of sustainable bio&#8208;based surfactants was explored derived from biomass monosaccharides. Amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide containing surfactants were prepared through a simple oxidation process. These carbohydrate&#8208;based surfactants showed comparable properties performance to their commercially applied benchmarks. These bio&#8208;based alternatives offered a reduced skin irritation potential rapid biodegradability, increased viscosity, making them good candidates for the formulation of bio&#8208;based personal care products.







Abstract
As the global surfactant market continues to expand, there is an increasing need to develop bio&#8208;based alternatives in the shift towards a circular economy. This study focuses on the synthesis of polar, amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide surfactants starting from biomass&#8208;derived monosaccharides and demonstrating their potential in various applications. The synthesis involved a reductive amination of the sugars with an alkylamine and formaldehyde followed by oxidation to produce N&#8208;oxide surfactants. These bio&#8208;based surfactants exhibited promising properties, including high solubility, foamability, surface tension reduction, and critical micelle concentration. In particular, N&#8208;GalA1.10 and N&#8208;GalA1.12 showed comparable performance to commercial surfactants. Furthermore, these bio&#8208;based surfactants demonstrated significantly lower skin irritation potential when compared to petrochemical&#8208;derived counterparts like sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), making them potentially suitable for personal care products. The biodegradability assessment revealed that N&#8208;GalA1.12 exhibited good biodegradation, indicating its potential environmental compatibility. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of bio&#8208;based N&#8208;oxide surfactants derived from monosaccharides as sustainable and skin&#8208;friendly alternatives to traditional amphoteric surfactants, like cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB).

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes of a Sterically Encumbered Anionic Pyridylborate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically loaded anionic pyridyl borate ligand has been utilized successfully to stabilize two&#8208;coordinate gold, silver, and copper phosphine complexes and a gold isocyanide complex, and to probe their solid&#8208;state structures, bonding, and spectroscopic features.







Abstract
Sterically loaded, anionic pyridine has been synthesized and utilized successfully in the stabilization of a isoleptic series of coinage metal complexes. The treatment of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]K (Trip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) with CuBr(PPh3), AgCl(PPh3) or AuCl(PPh3) (Py=pyridine) afforded the corresponding [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]M(PPh3) (M=Au, Ag, Cu) complexes, via salt metathesis, as isolable, crystalline solids. Notably, these reactions avoid the facile single electron transfer chemistry reported with the less bulky ligand systems. The X&#8208;ray structures revealed that they are two&#8208;coordinate metal adducts. The M&#8722;N and M&#8722;P bond distances are longest in the silver and shortest in the copper adduct among the three group 11 family members. Computational analysis revealed an interesting stability dependence on steric bulk of the anionic pyridine (i.&#8201;e., pyridyl borate) ligand. A comparison of structures and bonding of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3) to pyridine and m&#8208;terphenyl complexes, {[2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3)}[SbF6] and [2,6&#8208;Trip2Ph]Au(PPh3) are also provided. The Au(I) isocyanide complex, [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(CNBut) has been stabilized using the same anionic pyridylborate illustrating that it can support other gold&#8208;ligand moieties as well.

         <title>Bispidine Based Hg(II) 1D Coordination Polymers of Helical Topology: Stability, Selective Adsorption and 1D to 2D Dimensionality Change Via SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two remarkably similar coordination polymers made of bispidine ligand 1 and Hg(II) ions behave in a completely different way as one provides selective adsorption capabilities towards MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures while the other a 1D to 2D dimensionality change in a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC fashion.







Abstract
Bispidine based Hg(II) coordination polymers of helical topology CP&#8208;MeOH and CP&#8208;EtOH are almost isostructural (they mainly differ for the solvent included in their lattice and by a small % in unit cell parameters) but they differ for everything else: i) their intrinsic stability, ii) their ability to adsorb solvents upon prior evacuation, iii) their accessible structural transformations. In particular, one of the two starting materials, once evacuated, is capable to adsorb methanol from atmospheres containing binary and ternary mixtures of volatile organic compounds (MeOH, CHCl3 and EtOH) under ambient conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;atm) and with a marked selectivity. The other one is not, but undergoes a 1D to 2D dimensionality change which can be monitored in&#8197;situ by SC&#8208;XRD through a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC process.

A colorimetric sensor array based on homochiral metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework films in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities is presented. The sensor read&#8208;out is generated by recording the RGB values with a common smartphone camera, and the data are analyzed with a simple machine&#8208;learning algorithm. In addition to the enantioselective detection of chiral odor molecules, the sensor system enables the discrimination of a large number of commercial perfume scents.

         <title>Understanding Flexdispersion: Structure&#8211;Function Relationship Studies of Organic Amphiphilic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a schematic impression of our study on the &#8220;flexible&#8221; dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of alkyl chains and ethylene glycol chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. In this study, we have shown that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains alone does not define the dispersibility of nanoparticles in various solvents, but that the arrangement of individual chains also has an effect. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304324).

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;Pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Protected cysteine and its sulfoxide pairs allow stepwise disulfide bond formation, with the reaction increasing in acidity. This system enables an unprecedented synthesis of insulin possessing three disulfides and its lipidated analog. Stepwise formation of three disulfides generally requires three independent oxidation steps; however, the presented method has a single oxidation step. More information can be found in the Research by et al. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Otaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401003).

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones Initiated by Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cooperative Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis makes convergent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones through a three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water. Control experiments support that Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes and alkyl glyoxylates might be the initial step of this multicomponent annulation. Further chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydration of the alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis product and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition promoted by Br&#248;nsted acid results in the formation of two C&#8208;O bonds of the five&#8208;membered oxygen heterocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to Benzolactams and Benzolactones via Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylation with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling for accessing &#947;&#8208;lactams (isoindolinones) as well as &#947;&#8208;lactones (isobenzofuranones) via carbonylation with CO2 is documented. The protocol exploits the synergistic role of redox&#8208;active Ni(II) complexes and AlCl3 as a CO2 activator/oxygen scavenger, leading to the formation of a wide range of cyclic amides and esters (28 examples) in good to high yields (up to 87%). A dedicated computational investigation revealed the multiple roles played by AlCl3. In particular, the simultaneous transient protection of the pendant amino group of the starting reagents and the formation of the electrophilically activated CO2&#8208;AlCl3 adduct are shown to concur in paving the way for an energetically favorable mechanistic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in the Spectroscopic Spotlight of Hexaphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectroscopic properties are commonly used in the experimental evaluation of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity in expanded porphyrins. Herein, we investigate if the defining photophysical properties still hold for a diverse set of hexaphyrins with varying redox states, topologies, peripheral substitutions, and core&#8208;modifications. By combining TD&#8208;DFT calculations with several aromaticity descriptors and chemical compound space maps, the intricate interplay between structural planarity, aromaticity, and absorption spectra is elucidated. Our results emphasize that the general assumption that antiaromatic porphyrinoids exhibit significantly attenuated absorption bands as compared to aromatic counterparts does not hold even for the unsubstituted macrocycles. To connect the spectroscopic properties to the hexaphyrins&#8217; aromaticity behaviour, we analyzed chemical compound space maps defined by the various aromaticity indices. The intensity of the Q&#8208;band is not well described by the macrocyclic aromaticity. Instead, the degeneracy of the frontier molecular orbitals appears to be a better indicator to identify hexaphyrins with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing abilities in the near&#8208;infrared region. Regions with highly planar (anti)aromatic hexaphyrin structuresare characterized by an intense B&#8208;band. Hence, we advise to use a combination of both global and local aromaticity descriptors rooted in different criteria to assess the aromaticity of expanded porphyrins instead of solely using the absorption spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Semisynthetic glycoconjugates as potential vaccine candidates against Haemophilus influenzae type a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoconjugate vaccines are based on chemical conjugation of pathogen&#8208;associated carbohydrates with immunogenic carrier proteins and are considered a very cost&#8208;effective way to prevent infections. Most of the licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are composed of saccharide antigens extracted from bacterial sources. However, synthetic oligosaccharide antigens have become a promising alternative to natural polysaccharides with the advantage of being well&#8208;defined structures providing homogeneous conjugates. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is responsible for a number of severe diseases. In recent years, an increasing rate of invasive infections caused by Hi serotype a (Hia) raised some concern, because no vaccine targeting Hia is currently available. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Hia is constituted by phosphodiester&#8208;linked 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol&#8208;5&#8208;(PO4&#8594;) repeating units and is the antigen for protein&#8208;conjugated polysaccharide vaccines. To investigate the antigenic potential of the CPS from Hia, we synthesized related saccharide fragments containing up to five repeating units. Following the synthetic optimization of the needed disaccharide building blocks, they were assembled using the phosphoramidite approach for the installation of the phosphodiester linkages. The resulting CPS&#8208;based Hia oligomers were conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein and evaluated in vivo for their immunogenic potential, showing that all glycoconjugates were capable of raising antibodies recognizing Hia synthetic fragments.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Sustainable Materials: A Review of Acylhydrazone Chemistry for Reversible Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transitioning towards a circular economy, extensive research has focused on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to pave the way for more sustainable materials.

         <title>A Simply Synthesized Shaking&#8208;induced Small Molecule System with Repeatableand Instantaneous Discoloration Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Force&#8208;related discoloration materials are highly valuable because of their characteristics of visualization, easy operation, and environment friendliness. Most force&#8208;related discoloration materials focus on polymers and depend on bond scission, which leads to insensitivity and unrecoverable. Small&#8208;molecule systems based on well&#8208;defined molecular structures and simple composition with high sensitivity would exhibit considerable mechanochromic potential. However, to date, researches about force&#8208;related discoloration materials based on small molecule solution remain limited and are rarely reported. In this study, we developed a repeatable and instantaneous discoloration small molecule solution system by simple one&#8208;pot synthesis method. It exhibited an instantaneous chromic change from yellowish to dark green under shaking and reverting back to yellow within 1 minute after removal of the shaking. Experimental results confirmed that the discoloration mechanism is attributed to the oscillation accelerating the production of unstable ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical. The newly developed shaking&#8208;induced discoloration small molecule system (SDSMS) promises in field of mechanical force sensing and optical encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Effects on Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance in Flat&#8208;Lying Phenanthrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous results identified a 20&#8208;fold difference in conductance between phenanthrene derivatives with different anchoring group positions when measured upright between a gold surface and STM tip. This variation disappears when the phenanthrene derivatives lie flat between the tip and gold surface, all derivatives exhibit a conductance around 0.1 G0.







Abstract
A previous combined experimental and theoretical study found that the position of anchoring groups on a phenanthrene (PHE) backbone played a large role in determining the single&#8208;molecule conductance of the PHE derivative. However, a consistent 0.1 G0 feature was found across all PHE derivatives. To understand this, the previously investigated PHE derivatives were placed flat on a simulated Au substrate with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip over PHE and conductance was calculated using the non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function technique in conjunction with density functional theory (NEGF&#8208;DFT). The location of the tip was varied to find the most conductive and most energetically favorable arrangements, which did not coincide. Furthermore, the variation in conductance found in erect junctions was not present when PHE derivatives were lying flat, with all derivatives calculated to have conductance values around 0.1 G0.

         <title>Engineering Amino Acid and Peptide Supramolecular Architectures through Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination of amino acids deeply affects their self&#8208;assembly, enhancing, for instance, their tendency to aggregate into fibrils and gels. The conformational changes induced by fluorine can also change their functions, as well as the bioactivity of the deriving peptides and proteins, allowing to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable properties.







Abstract
Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are attracting considerable research interest, especially in the biomedical field and in materials science, thanks to their ability to self&#8208;assemble into peculiar supramolecular structures. The conformational changes induced by the presence of fluorine atoms obviously affect their functions, as well as the biological activity of the deriving peptides and proteins. Here, we will briefly describe the main effects of fluorination on the aggregation behavior of such building blocks, focusing in particular on their improved tendency to form fibrils, and gels therefrom. Our aim is to underline the promising potential of fluorination as a tool to affect the self&#8208;assembly features of amino acids, both when used alone and when inserted into polypeptide sequences. The ability of fluorine to influence physical, chemical, and structural properties of these substrates offers the possibility to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable functions.

         <title>Controlling Diastereoselectivity in Dearomatizing Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Nitroarenes with 2&#8208;Trimethylsilyloxycyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions between simple nitroarenes and cyclic silyloxydienes are carried out under high pressure at room temperature in the absence of any chemical promoter to generate 3D&#8208;scaffolds with exquisite exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity, the exo approach being characterized by a lower distortion of the substrates and by more favorable orbital interactions presumably between the nitro group and the dienic part.







Abstract
Dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions between nitroarenes and 2&#8208;trimethylsilyloxycyclohexadiene are carried out under high pressure at room temperature in the absence of any chemical promoter. Reactions are performed with different arenes, including the highly aromatic naphthalenes and quinolines. They lead to 3D&#8208;scaffolds with exquisite exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The exo approach is characterized by lower distortion of the substrates in a late TS and by more favorable orbital interactions presumably between the nitro group and the dienic part, explaining the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Boosting Excited&#8208;State Energy Transfer by Anchoring Dipole Orientation in Binary Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence/J&#8208;Aggregate Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchoring dipole orientation: In a binary nano&#8208;assembly, an anchoring effect between the energy donor (thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter (2CzPN)) and the energy acceptor (J&#8208;aggregate of a cyanine dye (Cy&#8208;J)), has boosted the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. This was achieved through fixing the parallel orientation of their transition dipole moments to enhance the orientation factor (&#954;2).







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been widely applied in fluorescence imaging, sensing and so on, while developing useful strategy of boosting FRET efficiency becomes a key issue that limits the application. Except optimizing spectral properties, promoting orientation factor (&#954;2) has been well discussed but rarely utilized for boosting FRET. Herein, we constructed binary nano&#8208;assembling of two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters (2CzPN and DMAC&#8208;DPS) with J&#8208;type aggregate of cyanine dye (C8S4) as doping films by taking advantage of their electrostatic interactions. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicated that 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films exhibit an order of magnitude higher kFRET than DMAC&#8208;DPS/Cy&#8208;J films. Further quantitative analysing on kFRET and kDET indicated higher orientation factor (&#954;2) in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films play a key role for achieving fast kFRET, which was subsequently confirmed by anisotropic measurements. Corresponding DFT/TDDFT calculation revealed strong &#8220;two&#8208;point&#8221; electrostatic anchoring in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films that is responsible for highly orientated transitions. We provide a new strategy for boosting FRET in nano&#8208;assemblies, which might be inspired for designing FRET&#8208;based devices of sensing, imaging and information encryption.

&lt;sub&gt;FRET&lt;/sub&gt;, which was subsequently confirmed by anisotropic measurements. Corresponding DFT/TDDFT calculation revealed strong &#8220;two-point&#8221; electrostatic anchoring in 2CzPN/Cy-J films that is responsible for highly orientated transitions. We provide a new strategy for boosting FRET in nano-assemblies, which might be inspired for designing FRET-based devices of sensing, imaging and information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silyliumylidene Ion Stabilized by Two &#963;&#8208;Donating Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silyliumylidene ion stabilized by two Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;donating ligands was synthesized. Its particular coordination mode was characterized by a pyramidalized silicon center with a lone pair. Interestingly, a ligand exchange reaction leads to a significant change in the coordination mode to form a metal&#8208;based donor/acceptor&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ion, characterized by a vacant orbital at the Si center. Despite the stabilization by the two metal ligands, the silyliumylidene complex remains highly reactive.







Abstract
A silyliumylidene ion 2 stabilized by two &#963;&#8208;donating Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;fragments was successfully synthesized. Due to the &#963;&#8208;donation of M&#8594;Si interactions, 2 presents a pyramidalized cationic silicon center with a localized lone pair. The additional coordination of basic Pd(0) fragment to the mono&#8208;Ni(0)&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene 1 results in a higher HOMO level and an unchanged HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and thus, 2 remains highly reactive. Interestingly, the coordination mode at the Si center is closely related to the nature of M&#8208;ligands. Indeed, the donor/donor&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ion 2 has been transformed into a donor/acceptor&#8208;stabilized ion 13, featuring a trigonal planar Si center with a vacant orbital, just via a ligand exchange reaction from PCy3/NHC toward PMe3.

         <title>Classical versus Collective Interactions in Asymmetric Trigonal Bipyramidal Alkaline Metal&#8211;Boron Halide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>

C3v&#8208;M2BX3 complexes (M=Li, Na, and K; X=F, Cl, and Br) may form in reduction of BX3 via alkali metals. In M2BX3 species a collective and a normal bond form simultaneously. Bond dissociation energies prove that the collective bond is more stable than the normal bond. Here, isodensity surface of Laplacian of electron density shows electron concentration regions in K2BBr3.







Abstract
Collective interactions are a novel type of chemical bond formed between metals and electron&#8208;rich substituents around an electron&#8208;poor central atom. So far only a limited number of candidates for having collective interactions are reported. In this work, we extend the newly introduced concept of collective bonding to a series of neutral boron complexes with the general formula M2BX3 (M=Li, Na, and K; X=F, Cl, and Br). Our state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ab initio computations suggest that these complexes form trigonal bipyramidal structures with a D3h to C3v distortion along the C3 axis of symmetry. The BX3 unit in the complexes distorts from planar to pyramidal akin to a sp3 hybridized atom. Interestingly, the interaction of the metals with the pyramidal side of BX3, where the lone pair in a hypothetical [BX3]2&#8722; should be located, is weaker than the interactions of metals with the inverted side, i.&#8201;e., the middle of three halogen atoms. The origin of this stronger interaction can be explained by the formation of collective interactions between metals and halogen atoms as we explored via energy decomposition within the context of the theory of interacting quantum atoms, IQA.

Stuck two&#8208;gether: The tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand stabilizes a dicopper carbene complex by enforcing its dinuclear core. This dinuclear copper core stabilizes a Fischer carbene through &#960;&#8208;backdonation to such an extent that it is unreactive even towards oxygen. However, we show that carbene transfer from this dinuclear complex towards PPh3 is still possible.







Abstract
The synthesis of a well&#8208;defined dicopper carbene complex supported by the PNNP (2,7&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine) expanded pincer ligand is reported. This carbene complex is remarkably stable, even in the presence of air and water. The reactivity of this complex was explored towards typical carbene transfer substrates and its electronic structure was investigated. Using a combination of experiments and DFT calculations, the principles that underly the stability of dinuclear carbene complexes are probed.

         <title>Exploring the Magnetic Interactions in Two Novel Cyanide&#8208;Bridged Homo&#8208; and Heterometallic Hexadecanuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a prototype of the in&#8208;depth analysis of the origin of magnetic interactions in two novel hexadecanuclear discrete multivalent [Fe16] and heterometallic [Fe6Ni10] PBAs possessing low symmetry structures. Ab initio and BS&#8208;DFT calculations justify the magnetic behaviour caused due to the orthogonal arrangement of the interacting orbitals with a small contribution of the magnetic anisotropy.







Abstract
Two novel isostructural cyanide&#8208;bridged hexadecanuclear complexes with the general formula {[Fe(CN)6]6[M{en(Bn)py}]10}2+ [M=Fe (12+), Ni (22+)] have been synthesized. The structural analyses disclose the presence of multivalent Fe centres with different spin states in complex 12+ whereas all the Fe centres share a conserved oxidation state in complex 22+. The DC magnetic study revealed antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent metal centres and ferrimagnetic behaviour in 12+. On the other hand, ferromagnetic interactions were observed in complex 22+ due to nearly orthogonal orientation of the interacting orbitals and poor spatial overlap as observed in BS&#8208;DFT calculations.

         <title>Pyrene Functionalized Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Fluorescent Photoswitches: Characterization of their Spectral Properties and Application in Imaging of Amyloid Beta Plaques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study we synthesize and characterise two novel fluorescent norbornadiene derivatives bearing pyrene moieties. In depth spectral and physico&#8208;chemical characterisation is presented; moreover, their application as dyes for imaging of amyloid beta aggregates in Alzheimer's mice models is investigated, with implications for bioimaging and protein aggregate studies.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of two fluorescent norbornadiene (NBD) photoswitches, each incorporating two conjugated pyrene units. Expanding on the limited repertoire of reported photoswitchable fluorescent NBDs, we explore their properties with a focus on applications in bioimaging of amyloid beta (A&#946;) plaques. While the fluorescence emission of the NBD decreases upon photoisomerization, aligning with what has been previously reported, for the first time we observed luminescence after irradiation of the quadricyclane (QC) isomer. We deduce how the observed emission is induced by photoisomerization to the excited state of the parent isomer (NBD) which is then the emitting species. Thorough characterizations including NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence, X&#8208;ray structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems. Notably, one NBD&#8208;QC system exhibits exceptional durability. Additionally, these molecules serve as effective fluorescent stains targeting A&#946; plaques in&#8197;situ, with observed NBD/QC switching within the plaques. Molecular docking simulations explore NBD interactions with amyloid, unveiling novel binding modes. These insights mark a crucial advancement in the comprehension and design of future photochromic NBDs for bioimaging applications and beyond, emphasizing their potential in studying and addressing protein aggregates.

         <title>Hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 Encapsulated Pd Catalysts for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>

Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited satisfactory selectivity and stability in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFA) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) is regarded as attractive transformation to achieve the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass resources. However, the conventional supported catalysts are significantly restricted by their narrow pore size, ununiform dispersion and easy leaching or aggregation of catalytic sites. Herein, we designed hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as the support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) to achieve the highly active and selective conversion of FFA to FA. Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited 96.8&#8201;% conversion of FFA with satisfactory selectivity reaching up to 92.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C, 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 in isopropanol solvent within 6&#8197;h. More importantly, as&#8208;prepared Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 catalyst exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, as well as good universality toward a series of hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>Variation in Catalytic Efficacies of a 2D pH&#8208;Stable MOF by Altering Activation Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust 2D MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, has been strategically designed and developed, which showed excellent catalytic activity in three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction under solvent&#8208;free condition. The significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances is specifically highlighted.







Abstract
Although it is well&#8208;known that the Lewis acidity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can effectively enhance their catalytic activity in organic transformations, access to these Lewis&#8208;acidic sites remains a key hurdle to widespread applications of Lewis&#8208;acidic catalysis by MOFs. Easy accessibility of strong Lewis acidic sites onto 2D MOFs by using proper activation methods can be a cornerstone in attaining desired catalytic performance. Herein, we report a new 2D chemically stable MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, which displayed excellent framework robustness over a wide pH range (2&#8211;12). Benefiting from the abundant open metal sites (OMSs) and framework robustness, the catalytic activity of the developed material was explored in one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Moreover, the developed catalyst is superior in catalyzing the reactions involving sterically hindered substrate (1&#8208;naphthaldehyde) with high turnover number. A comparative catalytic study was conducted using different activation methods (chloroform and methanol exchanged activated samples), highlighting the significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances. The sustainable synthetic pathway under solvent&#8208;free conditions for a broad scope of substrates using low catalyst loading and excellent recyclability made the developed pH&#8208;stable framework a promising heterogeneous catalyst.

         <title>Polymorphism of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Coordination Polymers: Impact of a Lead&#8211;Sulfur Network on Photoconductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8722;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties resulting from inorganic (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n network structures. However, these structures have never been correlated with their electronic properties. We reveal the impact of the (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity by comparing S&#8722;CP crystal polymorphs.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8722;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties that originate from infinite M&#8722;S bond networks. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two polymorphs of a two&#8211;dimensional (2D) Pb(II) S&#8722;CP with a formula of [Pb(tzdt)(OAc)] (Htzdt=1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, OAc=acetate). Our findings revealed that the thermodynamic product (KGF&#8208;26) possesses quasi&#8208;2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with weak nonbonded Pb&#8722;S bonds, whereas the kinetic product (KGF&#8208;27) has intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with Pb&#8722;S bonds. The results of time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity measurements and first&#8211;principles calculations confirmed that KGF&#8208;27 exhibits higher photoconductivity than KGF&#8208;26, which establishes that the inorganic (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks with Pb&#8722;S bonds are crucial for achieving high photoconductivity. This is the first experimental demonstration of the impact of the (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity through the comparison of crystal polymorphisms.

         <title>Tuning the Emission Properties of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzothiadiazoles via Regioselective Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective mono&#8208; and disubstitution of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) can result in long&#8208;lived fluorescence and overcome strong fluorescence quenching in polar protic solvents, addressing a limitation of many previously described BTD derivatives.







Abstract
The 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit is a prominent building block commonly used in various research areas such as optoelectronics and bioimaging. Despite its great versatility, the development of strategies to elaborate BTD has been largely neglected, including exploring its reactivity and understanding how regioselective functionalization can be used to tune the fluorescence emission. Previous focus has primarily been on C4&#8208; or C4,C7&#8208;substitutions. Here, a series of unsymmetrical mono &#8211; and disubstituted BTDs was synthesized and characterized for their photophysical properties. The reaction scope includes all six possible substituent patterns on the BTD benzoid ring (C4&#8208;, C5&#8208;, C4,C5&#8208;, C4,C6&#8208;, C4,C7&#8208; and C5,C6&#8208;substitution), which comprise arrangements that previously been synthetically challenging to access. By introducing a methoxy and/or a phenyl group we demonstrate that the emissive behavior of BTD derivatives strongly depends on the position of the substituent&#8197;(s). We show that regioselective substitution on BTD can engender long&#8208;lived fluorescence and circumvent strong fluorescence quenching in polar protic solvents, which is a limitation of many previously described BTD derivatives.

         <title>Comparison of Classical and Green RPLC Methods in the Determination of pKa Values of Some Piperazine Group Antihistamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the environmentally friendly green RPLC method was used as an alternative to classical RPLC methods in the determination of the pKa values of some antihistamines of the piperazine group and compared with the data obtained with other methods. In addition, the greenness of the RPLC methods used was determined using green metric tools.







Abstract
In this study, protonation constant values and liquid chromatographic behaviors of hydrophobic cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, hydroxyzine, cinnarizine, cetirizine, meclizine, and buclizine in some water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures were examined for the first time using classical and green reverse phase liquid chromatography methods. In the isocratic study, the relationship of the retention time and mobile phase pH in water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures containing acetonitrile (45, 50, 55, 60, 65%, v/v), methanol (60, 65, 70, 75%, v/v) and ethanol (45, 50, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 65%, v/v) were determined at 37&#8201;&#176;C. In the study, XBridge C18 and Gemini NX C18 columns suitable for the chemical properties of basic compounds were used. The obtained liquid chromatographic data were analyzed using the linear solvation energy relationship methodology and the SOLVER program. The aqueous protonation constant values of the investigated compounds were calculated using the linear relationship between the protonation constant data calculated in studied binary mixtures and some macroscopic constant values of the solvents used. The greenness of methods developed using three different solvents was evaluated with the Analytical Greenness Metric Approach, the Green Analytical Procedures Index, and the Green Solvent Selection Tool approaches.

         <title>Indenoannulated Tridecacyclene: An All&#8208;Carbon Seven&#8208;Stage Redox&#8208;Amphoter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenoannulated tridecacyclene, an unprecedented saddle&#8208;shaped non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon, has been synthesized. Under electrochemical conditions, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid subunits in the charged states. Chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the corresponding dication and dianion, which were comprehensively characterized both in experiment and theory.







Abstract
We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization

         <title>Multiple Bonding in AeN&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative bond in the 10 valence&#8208;electron species AeN&#8722; has a multireference character with high bond multiplicity in the triplet (3&#928;) ground state of CaN&#8722; and SrN&#8722; and singlet (1&#931;+) ground state of BaN&#8722;.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels as well as using density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeN&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba). The anions CaN&#8722; and SrN&#8722; have electronic triplet (3&#928;) ground states with nearly identical bond dissociation energies De ~57&#8197;kcal/mol calculated at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD level. In contrast, the heavier homologue BaN&#8722; has a singlet (1&#931;+) ground state, which is only 1.1&#8197;kcal/mol below the triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state. The computed bond dissociation energy of (1&#931;+) BaN&#8722; is 68.4&#8197;kcal/mol. The calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;full/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and BP86&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels are in reasonable agreement with the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD data, except for the singlet (1&#931;+) state, which has a large multireference character. The calculated atomic partial charges given by the CM5, Voronoi and Hirshfeld methods suggest small to medium&#8208;sized Ae&#8592;N&#8722; charge donation for most electronic states. In contrast, the NBO method predicts for all species medium to large Ae&#8594;N&#8722; electronic charge donation, which is due to the neglect of the (n)p AOs of Ae atoms as genuine valence orbitals. Neither the bond orders nor the bond lengths correlate with the bond dissociation energies. The EDA&#8722;NOCV calculations show that the heavier alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their (n)s and (n&#8208;1)d orbitals for covalent bonding.

Abstract
Diversified molecular information&#8208;processing methods have significant implications for nanoscale manipulation and control, monitoring and disease diagnosis of organisms, and direct intervention in biological activities. However, as an effective approach for implementing multifunctional molecular information processing, DNA reaction networks (DRNs) with numerous functionally specialized molecular structures have challenged them on scale design, leading to increased network complexity, further causing problems such as signal leakage, attenuation, and cross&#8208;talk in network reactions. Our study developed a strategy for performing various signal&#8208;processing tasks through engineering modular DRNs. This strategy is based on a universal core unit with signal selection capability, and a time&#8208;adjustable signal self&#8208;resetting module is achieved by combing the core unit and self&#8208;resetting unit, which improves the time controllability of modular DRNs. In addition, multi&#8208;input and &#8208;output signal cross&#8208;catalytic and continuously adjustable signal delay modules were realized by combining core and threshold units, providing a flexible, precise method for modular DRNs to process the signal. The strategy simplifies the design of DRNs, helps generate design ideas for large&#8208;scale integrated DRNs with multiple functions, and provides prospects in biocomputing, gene regulation, and biosensing.

&lt;p&gt;Diversified molecular information-processing methods have significant implications for nanoscale manipulation and control, monitoring and disease diagnosis of organisms, and direct intervention in biological activities. However, as an effective approach for implementing multifunctional molecular information processing, DNA reaction networks (DRNs) with numerous functionally specialized molecular structures have challenged them on scale design, leading to increased network complexity, further causing problems such as signal leakage, attenuation, and cross-talk in network reactions. Our study developed a strategy for performing various signal-processing tasks through engineering modular DRNs. This strategy is based on a universal core unit with signal selection capability, and a time-adjustable signal self-resetting module is achieved by combing the core unit and self-resetting unit, which improves the time controllability of modular DRNs. In addition, multi-input and -output signal cross-catalytic and continuously adjustable signal delay modules were realized by combining core and threshold units, providing a flexible, precise method for modular DRNs to process the signal. The strategy simplifies the design of DRNs, helps generate design ideas for large-scale integrated DRNs with multiple functions, and provides prospects in biocomputing, gene regulation, and biosensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Lattice Doping Enables a Low&#8208;Cost, High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Lasting Potassium Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium and Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel P3&#8208;type oxide, K0.57Cu0.1Fe0.1Mn0.8O2, is proposed to enhance KxMnO2 cathodes by addressing intrinsic issues and optimizing electrochemical properties. The co&#8208;doping strategy of multifunctional Cu and Fe element makes potassium&#8208;ion batteries more competitive for sustainable, low&#8208;cost energy storage. Additionally, the cathode can be adapted for sodium ion storage, offering a promising pathway for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides are highly promising host materials for K ions, owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate operational potentials. To address the intrinsic issues of KxMnO2 cathodes and optimize their electrochemical properties, a novel P3&#8208;type oxide doped with carefully chosen cost&#8208;effective, electrochemically active and multi&#8208;functional elements is proposed, namely K0.57Cu0.1Fe0.1Mn0.8O2. Compared to the pristine K0.56MnO2, its reversible specific is increased from 104 to 135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, the Cu and Fe co&#8208;doping triples the capacity under high current densities, and contributes to long&#8208;term stability over 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 68&#8201;%. Such endeavor holds the potential to make potassium&#8208;ion batteries particularly competitive for application in sustainable, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. In addition, the cathode is also extended for sodium storage. Facilitated by the interlayer K ions that protect the layered structure from collapsing and expand the diffusion pathway for sodium ions, the cathode shows a high reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, fast kinetics and a long lifespan over 1000&#8197;cycles. The findings offer a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>14&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;Diiminato Gold(II) &#8211; A New Member for the Gold(II) Complex Family?</title>

One&#8208;electron reduction of the macrocyclic gold(III) complex yields an elusive transient gold(II) species as shown by experimental (cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis, NMR, EPR spectroscopy) and quantum chemical methods (density functional theory).







Abstract
The chemistry of molecular gold compounds is dominated by the oxidation states +I and +III. For the intermediate oxidation state +II with 5d9 electron configuration, dimerization or disproportionation of the gold(II) radicals is favored, so that only a few mononuclear gold(II) complexes have been isolated to date. The present study addresses the one&#8208;electron reduction of the macrocyclic gold(III) complex [AuIIIL]+ of the innocent &#946;&#8208;diiminato ligand L2&#8722; with a 14&#8208;membered macrocycle (L2&#8722;=5,7,12,14&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradeca&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraenato). Electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and chemical reduction of [AuIIIL]+ monitored by UV/Vis, NMR and EPR spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations reveal disproportionation of the initially generated but elusive gold(II) complex AuIIL and provide guidelines for prospective stable mononuclear tetraazamacrocyclic gold(II) complexes.

         <title>Synthesis of Calix[4]arene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages and Their Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two octahedral porous organic cages with a significantly high specific surface area have been synthesized and their potential application in gas adsorption investigated by evaluating their capacity to adsorb SO2, CO2, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6. They also proved successful in efficiently adsorbing static iodine (I2) vapor.







Abstract
Two crystalline large&#8208;sized porous organic cages (POCs) based on conical calix[4]arene (C4A) were designed and synthesized. The four&#8208;jaw C4A unit tends to follow the face&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly law with the planar triangular building blocks such as tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) to generate a predictable cage with a stoichiometry of [6+8]. The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI&#8208;TOF/TOF spectra. The protonated molecular ion peaks of C4A&#8208;TAPA and C4A&#8208;TAPB were observed at m/z 5109.0 (calculated for C336H240O24N32: m/z 5109.7) and m/z 5594.2 (calculated for C384H264O24N24: m/z 5598.4). C4A&#8208;POCs exhibit I&#8208;type N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption isotherms with the BET surface areas of 1444.9&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1014.6&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. The CO2 uptakes at 273&#8197;K are 62.1&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 52.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a pressure of 100 KPa. The saturated iodine vapor static uptakes at 348&#8197;K are 3.9&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 3.5&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. The adsorption capacity of C4A&#8208;TAPA for SO2 reaches to 124.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;bar. Additionally, the adsorption capacities of C4A&#8208;TAPA for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were evaluated.

         <title>Reductions of Arenes using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>

Diene from a Birching. A magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductions of an array of unfunctionalized and functionalized arenes. The former proceed via &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reductions, while the latter typically result in reductive C&#8722;E (E=O, F or P) cleavage reactions.







Abstract
In this contribution, we present &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221;, and other reductions of simple arenes by the potassium salt of an anionic magnesium dinitrogen complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] (TCHPNON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), which acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in these reactions. This reagent is non&#8208;hazardous, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and in some cases provides access to 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene reduction products under relatively mild reaction conditions. This system works effectively to reduce benzene, naphthalene and anthracene through magnesium&#8208;bound &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates. Cyclohexadiene products can be subsequently released from the magnesium centres by protonolysis with methanol. In contrast, the reduction of substituted arenes is less selective and involves competing reaction pathways. For toluene and 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, the structural authentication of &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates is conclusive, although the formation of corresponding 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives was low yielding. Reduction of anisole did not yield an isolable &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; intermediate, but instead gave a C&#8722;O activation product. Treating triphenylphosphine with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] resulted in the extrusion of both biphenyl and dinitrogen to afford a magnesium(II) phosphanide [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)}2]. Reduction of fluorobenzene proceeded via C&#8722;F activation of the arene, and isolation of the magnesium(II) fluoride [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}2]. Finally, the two&#8208;electron reduction of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] yielded a complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;COT)], incorporating the aromatic dianion (COT2&#8722;).

         <title>Effect of Co&#8208;Adsorbed Guest Adsorbates on the Separation of Ethylene/Ethane Mixtures on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Open Metal Sites</title>

1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR renders the direct determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in the presence of guest adsorbates (H2O, CO2 and O2) on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions in the ternary mixture systems were unraveled from 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation MAS&#8197;NMR and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments.







Abstract
Direct determination of the equilibrium adsorption and spectroscopic observation of adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction is crucial to evaluate the olefin/paraffin separation performance of porous adsorbents. However, the experimental characterization of competitive adsorption of various adsorbates at atomic&#8208;molecular level in the purification of multicomponent gas mixtures is challenging and rarely conducted. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is employed to examine the effect of co&#8208;adsorbed guest adsorbates on the separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. 1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR facilitates the determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in ternary mixtures. The co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2 significantly leads to the degradation of ethylene uptake and ethylene/ethane selectivity. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions are unraveled by 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments. The experimental results verify H2O coordinated on open metal sites can supply a new adsorption site for ethylene and ethane. The effects of guest adsorbates on the adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane mixtures are in the following order: H2O&gt;CO2&gt;O2. This work provides a direct approach for exploring the equilibrium adsorption and detailed separation mechanism of multicomponent gas mixtures using MOFs adsorbents.

Herein, we describe B(C6F5)3/CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;indoles with unactivated dienes to access chiral 10,10&#8208;difluoro&#8208;tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indoles in good yields with good to excellent ee. The resulting cycloadducts containing an CF2 unit could be further transformed into other important building blocks.

This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities. Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the 10,10&#8208;difluoro&#8208;tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole skeleton was successfully achieved without any reduction in both yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Investigation of Isolated IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; Anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) Ion Pairs by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum&#8208;Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IR spectra of molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. The closed&#8208;shell IrF6&#8722; anion with Oh symmetry stabilized by SOC effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrices. The M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry feature coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms.







Abstract
The molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated alkali metal fluorides MF with IrF6 and isolated in solid neon or argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. The free anions were obtained as well by co&#8208;deposition of IrF6 with laser&#8208;ablated metals (Ir or Pt) as electron sources. The products were characterized in a combined analysis of matrix IR spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations using two&#8208;component quasi&#8208;relativistic DFT methods accounting for spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effects as well as multi&#8208;reference configuration&#8208;interaction (MRCI) approaches with SOC. Inclusion of SOC is crucial in the prediction of spectra and properties of IrF6&#8722; and its alkali&#8208;metal ion pairs. The observed IR bands and the computations show that the IrF6&#8722; anion adopts an Oh structure in a nondegenerate ground state stabilized by SOC effects, and not a distorted D4h structure in a triplet ground state as suggested by scalar&#8208;relativistic calculations. The corresponding &#8220;closed&#8208;shell&#8221; M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry are stabilized by coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms, and their structural change in the series from M=Na to Cs was proven spectroscopically. There is no evidence for the formation of IrF7, IrF7&#8722; or M[IrF7] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs in our experiments.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Cyclohepta[b]indoles and Cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;Indoline Conjugates via RCM, Hydrogenation, and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Expansion: A Biomimetic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient catalytic assembly for cyclohepta[b]indoles is achieved through sequential transformations: ring&#8208;closing metathesis, catalytic hydrogenation, and acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion. Ring closing metathesis (RCM) and hydrogenation of oxindoles yield spirocyclohexane&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles. A subsequent spontaneous ring expansion&#8208;aromatization sequence, catalyzed by either Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, results in cyclohepta[b]indoles or cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;indoline conjugates.







Abstract
Cyclohepta[b]indoles, prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals, are conventionally accessed via metal or Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cycloadditions with prefunctionalized substrates. Our study introduces an innovative sequential catalytic assembly for synthesizing cyclohepta[b]indoles from readily available isatin derivatives. The process involves three catalytic sequences: ring&#8208;closing metathesis, catalytic hydrogenation, and acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion. The RCM of 2,2&#8208;dialkene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles, formed by butenyl Grignard addition to 3&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, yields versatile spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole derivatives. These derivatives undergo further transformations, including dibromination, dihydroxylation, epoxidation, Wacker oxidation at the double bond. Hydrogenation of spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole yields spirocyclohexane&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles. Their subsequent acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion/aromatization, dependent on the acid catalyst, results in either cyclohepta[b]indoles or cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;indoline conjugates, adding a unique synthetic dimension. The utility of this methodology is exemplified through the synthesis of an A&#8208;FABP inhibitor, showcasing its potential in pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>Tetraanionic Oligo&#8208;Dioxaborines: Strongly Absorbing Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>

         <dc:description>
Strongly absorbing NIR polymethines of tetraanionic nature bearing 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine rings and different electron&#8208;accepting end&#8208;groups were synthesized and characterized. Due to a highly symmetric electronic structure of tetraanionic chromophore, the obtained dyes possess exceptionally high molar absorption coefficients (exceeding half a million) and good fluorescence quantum yields (up to 0.13).







Abstract
Polymethine dyes of tetraanionic nature comprising 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine rings in the polymethine chain and end&#8208;groups of different electron&#8208;accepting abilities have been synthesized. They can be considered as oligomeric polymethines, where a linear conjugated &#960;&#8208;system passes through three 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine units and a number of tri&#8208; and dimethine &#960;&#8208;bridges between two end&#8208;groups. The obtained dyes exhibit near&#8208;infrared absorption and fluorescence, with molar absorption coefficients reaching as high as 564000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF, rendering them among the strongest absorbers known. The novel compounds are bright NIR fluorophores, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.13 in DMF. A comparative analysis of the electronic structure of the obtained dyes with respective dianionic and trianionic oligomers was conducted through quantum chemical calculations.

         <dc:description>
Linkage of two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties was achieved to form a series of carboranyldithioester bridging ligands. Direct B(3)&#8208;H activation on these ligands without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was realized with half&#8208;sandwich [Cp*IrCl2]2 and confirmed by single crystal structure analysis. Their SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives further confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation.







Abstract
A method was developed to link two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties to form a series of carboranyl dithioester bridging ligands via in&#8197;situ substitution of haloalkanes by tetraphenylphosphonium carboranyldithiocarboxylates. Based on these ligands, direct B&#8722;H activation without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was successfully achieved with half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) substrate [Cp*IrCl2]2 to yield corresponding bimetallic or trimetallic complexes. Single crystal structure analyses of the B&#8722;H activated complexes and corresponding SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation in these complexes.

         <dc:description>
The attempted synthesis of a phosphaalumene is described. Due to the weak nature and high polarity of the P=Al &#960;&#8208;bond, this species undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand. The deleterious decomposition of this compound can be prevented by complexation with tetrahydrofuran, allowing for isolation of the Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, which retains the reactivity of the P=Al &#960;&#8208;bond toward polar and non&#8208;polar substrates.







Abstract
We describe our efforts to access a compound with an Al=P double bond by reaction of Al(Nacnac) towards [H2CN(Dipp)]2P(PCO) (Nacnac=HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Our observations are consistent with the formation of a transient phosphanyl&#8208;phosphaalumene at low temperatures (&#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C), however this species was found to readily undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H activation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand upon warming to room temperature. The reactivity of the transient complex toward small molecules including dihydrogen, carbon dioxide, phosphaketenes, amines and silanes could be explored at low temperatures, showcasing that the target compound can react as both a frustrated Lewis pair (via the pendant phosphanyl moiety) or in hydroelementation reactions of the Al=P bond. The elusive target molecule could be trapped by addition of a Lewis base (tetrahydrofuran) affording an isolable molecular species that reacts in an analogous fashion to the base&#8208;free compound.

         <title>Generation and Identification of the Trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs and Isomeric Perfluorinated Arsasilene FAsSiF2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel silylarsinidene F3SiAs and its isomer arsasilene FAsSiF2 are generated via the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated silicon atoms with AsF3 in low&#8208;temperature matrices and identified by matrix isolation IR spectroscopy as well as theoretical calculations. The isomerization of arsasilene FAsSiF2 to silylarsinidene F3SiAs under UV light (&#955; = 275&#8197;nm) was also observed.







Abstract
The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs in the triplet ground state has been generated through the reaction of laser&#8208;ablated silicon atoms with AsF3 in cryogenic Ne&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices. The reactions proceed with the initial formation of perfluorinated arsasilene FAsSiF2 in the singlet ground state by two As&#8722;F bonds insertion reaction on annealing. The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs was formed via F&#8208;migration reactions of FAsSiF2 under irradiation at UV light (&#955; = 275&#8197;nm). The characterization of FAsSiF2 and F3SiAs by IR matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopy is supported by computations at CCSD(T)&#8208;F12/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory.

Charge it up: Indenoannulation of tridecacyclene afforded a saddle&#8208;shaped nanocarbon with one octagonal and multiple pentagonal rings. The compound can undergo seven reversible redox events (highlighted as electron flashes), facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties in charged states (glowing non&#8208;hexagonal rings). The colors of the circles around the electrons are based on the color of the dication and dianion in solution. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kivala and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400696).

The cover picture shows two polymorphs of a 2D PbII coordination polymer with Pb&#8722;S bonds. The thermodynamic product features a 2D architecture composed of quasi&#8208;2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with weak, nonbonded Pb&#8722;S bonds, whereas the kinetic product forms a 2D structure containing intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with Pb&#8722;S bonds. Moreover, the kinetic product exhibits higher photoconductivity than the thermodynamic product owing to the presence of the intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Tanaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400618).

         <dc:description>
Structural and electronic chirality in inorganic crystals from conceptualization to practical applications is described in this work. Chirality can be engineered across various scales, ranging from macrostructures down to atomic arrangements and even individual electrons. The interplay between structural and electronic chirality not only facilitates the design of highly efficient devices and chemical reactions but also offers insights into the origins of life. For further details, see the Review authored by W. Li, G. Li, and their collaborators (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400436).

Lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PersLSs) are promising luminescent materials for many emerging applications. This review summarizes the latest development of PersLSs, including their persistent luminescence mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of optical properties, and their applications in the field of information security, bioimaging, as well as sensing.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators have the ability to convert the absorbed X&#8208;ray irradiation into ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators with excellent persistent luminescence (PersL) are emerging as a new class of PersL materials recently. They have attracted great attention due to their unique &#8220;self&#8208;luminescence&#8221; characteristic and potential applications. In this review, we comb through and focus on current developments of lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PersLSs), including their PersL mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of PersL properties (e.&#8201;g. emission wavelength, intensity, and duration time), as well as their promising applications (e.&#8201;g. information storage, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, bio&#8208;imaging, and photodynamic therapy). We hope this review will provide valuable guidance for the future development of PersLSs.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Chirality in Inorganic Crystals: from Construction to Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 34, June 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring chirality in inorganic crystals is a fascinating endeavor, encompassing both structural and electronic chirality. This work offers a comprehensive review of the classification and construction of chirality in inorganic crystals. Additionally, it delves into the potential applications of these crystals within the realms of chemistry and physics, providing a thorough insight into their multifaceted implications and uses.







Abstract
Chirality represents a fundamental characteristic inherent in nature, playing a pivotal role in the emergence of homochirality and the origin of life. While the principles of chirality in organic chemistry are well&#8208;documented, the exploration of chirality within inorganic crystal structures continues to evolve. This ongoing development is primarily due to the diverse nature of crystal/amorphous structures in inorganic materials, along with the intricate symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships in the geometry of their constituent atoms. In this review, we commence with a summary of the foundational concept of chirality in molecules and solid states matters. This is followed by an introduction of structural chirality and electronic chirality in three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials. The construction of chirality in inorganic materials is classified into physical photolithography, wet&#8208;chemistry method, self&#8208;assembly, and chiral imprinting. Highlighting the significance of this field, we also summarize the research progress of chiral inorganic materials for applications in optical activity, enantiomeric recognition and chiral sensing, selective adsorption and enantioselective separation, asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, and chirality&#8208;induced spin polarization. This review aims to provide a reference for ongoing research in chiral inorganic materials and potentially stimulate innovative strategies and novel applications in the realm of chirality.

         <dc:description>
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) is a popular material at present. Its preparation methods are various, mainly can be divided into direct synthesis and indirect synthesis. Because of its special structural advantages, it has been widely used in Enantiomer recognition, Enantiomer separation, Circularly polarized luminescence and Asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) is a kind of material with great application value in recent years. Formed by the coordination of metal ions or metal clusters with organic ligands. It has ordered and adjustable pores, multi&#8208;dimensional network structure, large specific surface area and excellent adsorption properties. This material structure combines the properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with the chiral properties of chiral molecules. It has great advantages in catalysis, adsorption, separation and other fields. Therefore, it has a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, medicine and materials science. In this paper, various synthesis strategies and preparation methods of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks are reviewed from different perspectives, and the advantages of each method are analyzed. In addition, the applications of chiral metal&#8208;organic framework materials in enantiomer recognition and separation, circular polarization luminescence and asymmetric catalysis are systematically summarized, and the corresponding mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the development of chiral metal&#8208;organic frame materials are analyzed in detail.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes: Halogen&#8208;Doped Anthracene as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ElectrochemicaTransistor set&#8208;up proposed in this paper features the peculiar characteristics that a suitable functionalized materials acts both as the working electrode (in an electrochemical cell) and the gate (in the transistor source/gate/drain layout). Allowing for simultaneous potential control and electrical impedance measurement of the working/gate (anthracene is used as working/gate electrode).







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) crystals exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties with interesting applications. We present a rational and easy guide which allows to foresee the effective charge transfer co&#8208;crystal production and that is based on the comparison of the frontier molecular orbital (MO) energies of a donor and acceptor couple. For the sake of comparison, theoretical calculations have been carried out by using the cheap and fast PM6 semiempirical Hamiltonian and pure HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ level of the theory. The results are then compared with experimental results obtained both by chemical (bromine and iodine were used as the acceptor) and electrochemical doping (exploiting an original experimental set&#8208;up by this laboratory: the electrochemical transistor). Infra&#8208;red vibrational experimental results and theoretically calculated spectra are compared to assess both the effective donor&#8208;acceptor (D/A) charge&#8208;transfer and transport mechanism (giant IRAV polaron signature). XPS spectra have been collected (carbon (1&#8197;s) and iodine (3d5/2)) signals, yielding further evidence of the effective formation of the CT anthracene:iodine complex.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lanthanide&#8211;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Cycloaddition of CO2 with Epoxides and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8211;organic framework (HE&#8208;LnMOF) heterogeneous catalyst toward sustainable CO2 conversion reactions. The five rare earth metals were well&#8208;dispersed and randomly distributed in the structure. The HE&#8208;LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, abundant Lewis acid and base interaction sites at the same time. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;metallic Ln3+ ions endow it with outstanding catalytic performance.







Abstract
Multimetallic synergistic effects have the potential to improve CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reaction processes, outperforming monometallic MOFs. The results demonstrate superior performance in these processes. To investigate this, we created and characterized a selection of single&#8208;component Ln(III)&#8208;MOFs (Ln=Eu, Tb, Gd, Dy, Ho) and high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8208;organic framework (HE&#8208;LnMOF) using solvent&#8208;thermal conditions. The experiments revealed that HE&#8208;LnMOF exhibited heightened catalytic efficiency in CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reactions compared to single&#8208;component Ln(III) MOFs. Moreover, the HE&#8208;LnMOF displayed significant stability, maintaining their structural integrity after five cycles while sustaining elevated conversion and selectivity rates. The feasible mechanisms of catalytic reactions were also discussed. HE&#8208;LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, acting as Lewis acid sites, with oxygen atoms connecting the metal, and hydroxyl groups on the ligand serving as base sites. This study introduces a novel method for synthesizing HE&#8208;LnMOF and presents a fresh application of HE&#8208;LnMOF for converting CO2.

         <title>Unusual Photochemistry in Aromatic Dithioimides: Quantitative Thione Reduction Promoted by Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the photochemical reaction of dithioimide (2SS) in ether&#8208;containing solvents. While 2SS undergoes photooxidation in the presence of oxygen (forming 2OO), under glove&#8208;box conditions it undergoes an unusual but efficient photoreduction to form 2SH2. Reaction product studies and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving the THF radical.







Abstract
We report a mechanistic investigation of an aromatic dithioimide (2SS) displaying puzzling yet efficient photochemistry in ether solvents. Perplexingly, 2SS dissolved in ether solvents in a sealed and degassed vial was photochemically converted to the corresponding diimide (2OO), as determined by 1H NMR following product extraction. With no external sources of oxygen in the sample, could the oxygen in 2OO be from the ether itself? To study this unprecedented proposition, we attempt to uncover the ether's involvement in this reaction. As seen by laser&#8208;flash photolysis, 2SS appears to first react with the solvent from its singlet excited state. Following the reaction by NMR under rigorously oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;free conditions led to the identification of a photoreductive pathway that quantitatively transformed one thione into a methylene to yield 2SH2. Subsequent oxidation of 2SH2 or irradiation of 2SS under air proved that molecular oxygen was indeed necessary to observe an oxidative pathway leading to 2OO, ruling out the initially proposed involvement of an ether oxygen. An explanation of 2SS desulfurization was further revealed through the study of solvent by&#8208;products by GC&#8208;MS analysis. Supported by DFT calculations, a mechanism is proposed to involve a chain reaction initiated by photochemically generated ether radical.

         <title>Gaining Insights into the Interplay between Optical and Magnetic Properties in Photoexcited Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article explores the understanding of the interplay of electronic and magnetic properties on the optical signatures of 3d&#8211;4f single molecule magnets (SMMs). It presents a combination of multiple time and frequency domain techniques including transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer measurements.







Abstract
We describe early and recent advances in the fascinating field of combined magnetic and optical properties of inorganic coordination compounds and in particular of 3d&#8211;4f single molecule magnets. We cover various applied techniques which allow for the correlation of results obtained in the frequency and time domain in order to highlight the specific properties of these compounds and the future challenges towards multidimensional spectroscopic tools. An important point is to understand the details of the interplay of magnetic and optical properties through performing time&#8208;resolved studies in the presence of external fields especially magnetic ones. This will enable further exploration of this fundamental interactions i.&#8201;e. the two components of electromagnetic radiation influencing optical properties.

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline) Amphiphilicity Tunes the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer of Pyrenol&#8208;Based Polyphotoacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photo&#8208;responsive nature of polyphotoacids for their applicability in targeted release of cargo depends on an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) step and therefore on the hydration of the local environment. Hence this contribution provides a mechanistic understanding of ESPT in polyoxazoline&#8208;based polymers with varying degrees of hydration with pyrenol as the photoacid of choice.







Abstract
The ability of light to change the properties of light&#8208;responsive polymers opens avenues for targeted release of cargo with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. Recently, we established photoacid polymers as light&#8208;switchable macromolecular amphiphiles. In these systems, light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) causes changes in amphilicity. However, as the intermolecular process itself critically depends on the local environment of the photoacid unit within the polymer, the overall amphiphilicity directly influences ESPT. Thus, understanding the impact of the local environment on the photophysics of photoacidic side chains is key to material design. In this contribution we address both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of ESPT in oxazoline&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers with pyrenol&#8208;based photoacid side chains. We will compare the effect of polymer design, i.&#8201;e. statistical and block arrangements, i.&#8201;e. in poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;(6/8&#8208;hydroxyperene)sulphonylaziridine)] and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;block&#8208;poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(2&#8208;(3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxypyrene)sulphonamide)propyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), on the intermolecular proton transfer reaction by combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. ESPT appears more prominent in the statistical copolymer compared to a block copolymer with overall similar pyrenol loading. We hypothesize that the difference is due to different local chain arrangements adopted by the polymers in the two cases.

         <title>Mechanochemical Regioselective [3+3] Annulation of 6&#8208;Amino Uracil with Propargyl Alcohols Catalyzed by a Br&#248;nsted Acid/Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first mechanochemical annulation of 6&#8208;amino uracil with tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols by milling with p&#8208;TSA/HFIP. This regioselective annulation proceeds through the allenylation of uracil and subsequent 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. Interestingly, sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols furnished the propargylation of amino uracil.







Abstract
A mechanochemistry approach is developed for regioselective synthesis of functionalized dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines by milling propargylic alcohols and 6&#8208;aminouracils with HFIP/p&#8208;TsOH. In the case of tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols, this [3+3] cascade annulation proceeded through allenylation of uracil followed by a 6&#8208;endo trig cyclization. With sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols, the reaction furnished the propargylation of uracil. This atom economy ball milling reaction allows access to a broad range of dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine derivatives in excellent yields. We demonstrated the gram scale synthesis of 3&#8201;g and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to effect the cyclization of 5 to 6.

         <title>Poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Artificial Organelles for Biomimetic Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(ferrocenylmethylethylthiocarboxypropylsilane) (PFC), a kind of novel polymer possesses excellent redox property, was employed to fabricate microcapsules via self&#8208;assembly at the interface of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets. Within these PFC MCs, enzymatic cascades are induced through active molecular exchange across the membrane to mimic the functions of enzymes in mitochondria. We anticipate that the functional PFC MCs have the potential to serve as innovative platforms for artificial organelles capable of executing specific cellular functions.







Abstract
Artificial organelles serve as functional counterparts to natural organelles, which are primarily employed to artificially replicate, restore, or enhance cellular functions. While most artificial organelles exhibit basic functions, we diverge from this norm by utilizing poly(ferrocenylmethylethylthiocarboxypropylsilane) microcapsules (PFC MCs) to construct multifunctional artificial organelles through water/oil interfacial self&#8208;assembly. Within these PFC MCs, enzymatic cascades are induced through active molecular exchange across the membrane to mimic the functions of enzymes in mitochondria. We harness the inherent redox properties of the PFC polymer, which forms the membrane, to facilitate in&#8208;situ redox reactions similar to those supported by the inner membrane of natural mitochondria. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFC MCs and living cell including extended lifespans within various cell types. We anticipate that functional PFC MCs have the potential to serve as innovative platforms for organelle mimics capable of executing specific cellular functions.

We harness the inherent redox properties of the PFC polymer, which forms the membrane, to facilitate in-situ redox reactions similar to those supported by the inner membrane of natural mitochondria. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFC MCs and living cell including extended lifespans within various cell types. We anticipate that functional PFC MCs have the potential to serve as innovative platforms for organelle mimics capable of executing specific cellular functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Br&#248;nsted Acids on the Activation of Mixed Anhydride/Mixed Carbonic Anhydride and C&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Methylated Peptide Synthesis in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison between amidations using mixed carbonic anhydride and mixed anhydride in the presence of tertiary amine and Br&#248;nsted acids revealed a significant difference in the anhydrides. A rapid micro&#8208;flow C&#8208;terminal&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis via acyl imidazolium without severe racemization has been developed. Unexpectedly, epimerization of the C&#8208;terminal&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated dipeptide was observed.







Abstract
Amidations employing mixed (carbonic) anhydrides have long been favoured in peptide synthesis because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness and less waste generation. Despite their long history, no study has compared the effects of additives on the activation of mixed anhydrides and carbonic anhydrides. In this study, we investigated the amidation of mixed (carbonic) anhydride in the presence of a base and/or Br&#248;nsted acids. The use of NMI&#8901;HCl significantly improved the conversion of the mixed carbonic anhydride, while expediting nucleophilic attacks on the desired carbonyl group. In contrast, in the case of mixed anhydrides, neither the conversion nor the desired nucleophilic attack improved significantly. We developed a C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis method using mixed carbonic anhydrides in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. Fourteen N&#8208;alkylated peptides were synthesized in moderate to high yields (55&#8211;99&#8201;%) without severe racemization (&lt;1&#8201;%). Additionally, a significant enhancement in the amidation between mixed carbonic anhydrides and bis&#8208;TMS&#8208;protected N&#8208;methyl amino acids with the inclusion of NMI&#8901;HCl was observed for the first time. In addition, we observed unexpected C&#8208;terminal epimerization of the C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methyl peptides.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Alcohols to &#946;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Vinylsulfones by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric organocatalytic oxa&#8208;Michael reaction has been developed to synthesize chiral secondary alcohol derivatives with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Particularly noteworthy is the utilization of aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles in the asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael step, overcoming obstacles associated with their direct utilization as Michael donors. Furthermore, a sequential process offers a novel synthetic strategy for constructing essential fluorinated chiral alcohols from readily available materials.







Abstract
Chiral secondary alcohols, serving as essential structural motifs, hold significant potential for diverse applications. The exploration of effective synthetic strategies toward these compounds is both attractive and challenging. Herein, we present an asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael reaction involving aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles and &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl vinylsulfones catalyzed by bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS), achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Additionally, a sequential process including asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael and debenzylation, facilitated by BPS/Lewis acid cooperation, was revealed for synthesizing diverse chiral secondary alcohol compounds in high yields (81&#8211;88&#8201;%) with consistent stereoselectivities. Furthermore, mechanistic explorations and subsequent results unveiled that the enantioselectivity originates from hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair interactions between the BPS catalyst and the substrates.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Novel Water&#8208;Soluble Cationic Platinum(II) Organometallic Complexes with Phenanthroline and Imidazolic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the synthesis of monofunctional platinum(II) complexes for anticancer evaluation. Remarkably, complex 4 demonstrated the most pronounced cytotoxicity across both cancer (HeLa and Caki&#8208;1) and normal cell lines (HK&#8208;2). In contrast, complex 3 displayed superior selectivity for tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2) among the examined complexes. So, complex 3 signifies a lead entity in a promising class of antitumor agents.







Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents are widely used in the treatment of cancer. However, their effectiveness is limited by severe adverse reactions, drug resistance, and poor water solubility. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of new water&#8208;soluble cationic monofunctional platinum(II) complexes starting from the [PtCl(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)] (1, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) precursor, specifically [Pt(NH3)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (2), [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (3), and [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (4), which deviate from traditional requirements for antitumor activity. These complexes were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects in comparison to cisplatin, using immortalized cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), human renal carcinoma cells (Caki&#8208;1), and normal human renal cells (HK&#8208;2). While complex 2 showed minimal effects on the cell lines, complexes 3 and 4 demonstrated higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin. Notably, complex 4 displayed the highest cytotoxicity in both cancer and normal cell lines. However, complex 3 exhibited the highest selectivity for renal tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) among the tested complexes, compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2). This resulted in a significantly higher selectivity than that of cisplatin and complex 4. Therefore, complex 3 shows potential as a leading candidate for the development of a new generation of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, utilizing biocompatible imidazole ligands while demonstrating promising anticancer properties.

         <title>Interaction of C60 with Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Surfaces: Unveiling the Role of C60 in Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of C60 on MAPbI3 perovskite surfaces has been systematically explored by means of periodic density functional simulations. The charge transfer from the perovskite to the C60 to increases due to the presence of defects like Pb vacancies or I antisites, and C60 is able to promote the surface reconstruction.







Abstract
Understanding the interaction between fullerene (C60) and perovskite surfaces is pivotal for advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior of C60 on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations. We explore various surface terminations and defect configurations to elucidate the influence of surface morphology on the C60&#8208;perovskite interaction, computing the adsorption energy and transfer of charge. Our results reveal distinct adsorption energies and charge transfer mechanisms for different surface terminations, shedding light on the role of surface defects in modifying the electronic structure and stability of perovskite materials. Furthermore, we provide insights into the potential of C60 to passivate surface defects, playing a relevant role in the surface reconstruction after the formation of defects. This comprehensive understanding of C60&#8208;perovskite interactions offers valuable guidelines about the role of fullerenes on surface structure and reconstruction.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Molecular Processes in DNA: A Perspective on Gas&#8208;Phase Interaction Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective explores the technical developments towards crossed&#8208;beam studies of ionizing radiation with mass&#8208;selected and conformationally pure beams of oligonucleotide ions. It reviews key developments in the field and highlights challenges. The relevance of expected future results as benchmarks for quantum chemical calculations and for multiscale&#8208;modelling of radiation therapy is outlined.







Abstract
Studying the direct effects of DNA irradiation is essential for understanding the impact of radiation on biological systems. Gas&#8208;phase interactions are especially well suited to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying these direct effects. Only relatively recently, isolated DNA oligonucleotides were irradiated by ionizing particles such as VUV or X&#8208;ray photons or ion beams, and ionic products were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This article provides a comprehensive review of primarily experimental investigations in this field over the past decade, emphasizing the description of processes such as ionization, fragmentation, charge and hydrogen transfer triggered by photoabsorption or ion collision, and the recent progress made thanks to specific atomic photoabsorption. Then, we outline ongoing experimental developments notably involving ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, crossed beams or time&#8208;resolved measurements. The discussion extends to potential research directions for the future.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Carbofluorination of Olefins and &#945;&#8208;Fluoroolefins with Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of silver oxide (Ag2O) catalyst, potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) and SelectfluorTM was identified to perform radical carbofluorination reactions of olefin and &#945;&#8208;fluoroolefin substrates with carbamoyl radicals generated in&#8197;situ from sodium oxamate salts. Both transformations proceed under mild conditions and provide respectively a straightforward access to &#946;&#8208;fluoroamides and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoroamides.







Abstract
The reactivity of carbamoyl radicals, generated in&#8197;situ from sodium oxamate salts, has been investigated in the context of radical carbofluorination reactions of olefins and &#945;&#8208;fluoroolefins, respectively. Both transformations are catalyzed by silver salts and required the presence of potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) and SelectfluorTM as a radicophilic fluorine source. The reported methods provide a direct access to &#946;&#8208;fluoroamides and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoroamides.

         <title>Keplerate&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Higher Performance via the Morphology Modulation of Blackberry Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keplerate&#8208;type Polyoxometalates (POMs) can self&#8208;assemble to form larger black strawberry structures. We prepare the larger roughness and higher surface potential of film through spin&#8208;coating, which is first used as the positive tribe&#8208;material in the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The TENG has a higher heat resistance and stability and has been applied in the wearable era with better output performance.







Abstract
The tribe&#8208;material is the key factor affecting the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Inorganic materials have higher heat resistance and stability than widely used organic materials. However, the weaker tribe&#8208;property limits the application of TENGs. Modulating surface roughness by changing particle shape and size is a simple way to increase performance for TENGs. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have unrivalled structural diversity and can self&#8208;assemble to form different nanostructures. In this study, we propose [{(NH4)42[Mo72VIMo60VO372(CH3COO)30 (H2O)72]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ca.300H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ca.CH3COONH4)}&#8208;Mo132] and [{Na8K14(VO)2[{(MoVI) (Mo5VIO21)(H2O)3]}10{(MoVI)Mo5VIO21(H2O)3 (SO4)}2{VIVO(H2O)20} {VIVO}10({KSO4}5)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;150H2O)}&#8208;Mo72V30] with blackberry structure which are cured and prepared into film by spin&#8208;coating technique, are used as positive tribe&#8208;materials for the first time in the field of TENGs. Keplerate&#8208;type POMs can form blackberry structures with higher dispersibility and flexibility, which can be used to control surface roughness by regulating the size of particles. The discovery proves that the particle size influences the surface roughness, which adjusts the output of TENGs. According to our findings, Mo132&#8208;h&#8208;TENG generates an output voltage of 29.3&#8197;V, an output charge of 8 Nc, which is 2&#8211;3 folds higher than Mo132&#8208;TENG, and a maximum power density of 6.25&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2 at 300&#8197;M&#937;. Our research provides that altering the dimensional size can be an available way to raise the output of TENGs.

         <title>The Role of Lysozyme in the Formation of Bioinspired Silicon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of formation of silica templated by lysozyme is here interrogated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results strongly suggest that the &#8211; densely charged &#8211; protein electrostatically attracts the precursor and can thus accelerate the polycondensation reaction by increasing its concentration.







Abstract
Several organisms are able to polycondensate tetraoxosilicic(IV) acid to form silicon(IV) dioxide using polycationic molecules. According to an earlier mechanistic proposal, these molecules undergo a phase separation and recent experimental evidence appears to confirm this model. At the same time, polycationic proteins like lysozyme can also promote polycondensation of silicon(IV) dioxide, and they do so under conditions that are not compatible with liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. In this manuscript we investigate this conundrum by molecular simulations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of low&#8208;energy sunlight to produce renewable fuels is a subject of great interest. Here we report the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) capped with a pyridinethiolate carboxylic acid (pyS&#8208;COOH) for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production in water. The precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free system is robust over 240 h, and achieves a turnover number (TON) of 43910 &#177; 305 (vs Ni) with a rate of 31570 &#177; 1690 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for hydrogen production. In contrast to the inactive QDs capped with other thiolate ligands, the CdSe&#8208;pyS&#8208;COOH QDs give a significantly higher singlet oxygen quantum yield [&#934;&#916; (1O2)] in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Gold(I)&#8208;Distorted Porphyrin Dinuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between gold&#8208;based materials and dioxygen (O2) have motivated researchers to understand reaction mechanisms for O2 activation by homo&#8208; and heterogeneous gold catalysts. In this work, gold(I) porphyrin dinuclear complexes were synthesized with a saddle&#8208;distorted porphyrin ligand. The gold(I) porphyrin complexes showed unprecedented O2 activation in the presence of protic solvents to form gold(III) tetradentate porphyrin complexes. Mechanistic insights into the O2 activation by the gold(I) center were elucidated by spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations, revealing that dissociation of halides on the gold(I) center by alcohol solvents and hydrogen bonding of an N&#8211;H proton in the distorted porphyrin with dioxygen played important roles in establishing the unique reactivities of gold(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type and Ambipolar Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have drawn great attention in the field of organic electronics due to the planar structure, decent solubilizing capability, and high crystallinity. However, the electron&#8208;deficient capacity of DPP derivatives are not strong enough, leading to relatively high&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the corresponding polymers. As a result, n&#8208;type and ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers are rare and their electron mobilities also lag far behind the p&#8208;type counterparts, which limits the development of important p&#8208;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based electronic devices. Therefore, new design strategies have been proposed recent years to develop n&#8208;type/ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers with improved performances. In this view, these molecular design strategies are summarized, including copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization. The relationship between the chemical structures and organic thin&#8208;film transistor performances is intensively discussed. Finally, a perspective on future trends in the molecular design of DPP&#8208;based n&#8208;type/ambipolar polymers is also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>An in&#8208;depth exploration of six decades of the Kr&#246;hnke pyridine synthesis &#8211; a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis has been discovered about six decades ago (1961), by Fritz Kr&#246;hnke and Wilfried Zecher at the University of Giessen. The original method involved the reaction of &#945;&#8208;pyridinium methyl ketone salts with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of a nitrogen source, frequently ammonium acetate. Since its discovery, the Kr&#246;hnke methodology has been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;pyridines, with important applications in several research fields. Over the years, a number of modifications to the original approach have been developed and reported, enabling for the broad applicability of these methods even in modern days, also for the synthesis of non&#8208;pyridine compounds. In this critical and tutorial review, we will thoroughly explore and discuss the potential of the original method, the refinements that have been made over the years, as well as some applications arising from each type of pyridine and/or non&#8208;pyridine compounds produced by Kr&#246;hnke&#8217;s approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Reactions Enabled by Mechanical Force&#8208;Induced&#160;Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical reactions, achieved through milling, grinding, or other mechanical actions, have emerged as a solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Mechanochemistry not only provides the opportunity to eliminate bulk solvent use, reducing waste generation, but also unveils a new reaction strategy which enables the realization of reactions previously inaccessible in solution. While the majority of organic reactions facilitated by mechanical force traditionally follow two&#8208;electron transfer pathways similar to their solution&#8208;based counterparts, the field of mechanochemically induced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions has witnessed rapid development. This review outlines examples of mechanochemical reactions facilitated by the SET process, focusing on the reagents that initiate SET, thereby positioning mechanochemistry as a burgeoning field within the realm of single&#8208;electron chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing the Oligomers Distribution along the Aggregation Pathway of Amyloid A&#946;1&#8208;40 by NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#946;1&#8208;40 seed&#8208;free sample is recovered after rapid isomerization of 26&#8208;O&#8208;acyl isoA&#946;1&#8208;40 at neutral pH. NMR 1D 1H spectra and diffusion measurements collected over time, coupled with their analysis through the Inverse Laplace Transform reconstruction method, detect changes in the oligomeric distribution along the aggregation pathway of amyloid A&#946;1&#8208;40. The presented approach emerges as a valuable tool in drug discovery.







Abstract
This study delves into the early aggregation process of the A&#946;1&#8208;40 amyloid peptide, elucidating the associated oligomers distribution. Motivated by the acknowledged role of small oligomers in the neurotoxic damage linked to Alzheimer's disease, we present an experimental protocol for preparing 26&#8208;O&#8208;acyl isoA&#946;1&#8208;40, a modified A&#946;1&#8208;40 peptide facilitating rapid isomerization to the native amide form at neutral pH. This ensures seed&#8208;free solutions, minimizing experimental variability. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of coupling NMR diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) with the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) reconstruction method, for effective characterization of early aggregation processes. This innovative approach efficiently maps oligomers distributions across a wide spectrum of initial peptide concentrations offering unique insights into the evolution of oligomers relative populations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach assessing the impact of Epigallocathechin gallate, a known remodeling agent of amyloid fibrils, on the oligomeric distributions of aggregated A&#946;1&#8208;40. The DOSY&#8208;ILT proposed approach stands as a robust and discriminating asset, providing a powerful strategy for rapidly gaining insight into potential inhibitors&#8217; impact on the aggregation process.

         <title>Aggregation mechanisms and molecular structures of amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid plaques&#160;are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and consist of&#160;deposits of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can&#160;undergo liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation.&#160;In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the&#160;regulatory&#160;role of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of A&#946; oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. The structural variations of A&#946; aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure&#8208;based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Tripodal BODIPY&#8208;Tagged and Functional Molecular Probes: Synthesis, Computational Investigations and Explorations by Multiphoton Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: A range of novel BODIPY derivatives with a tripodal aromatic core was synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. These new fluorophores showed promising features as probes for in vitro assays in live cells and offer strategic routes for further functionalization towards hybrid nanomaterials. Incorporation of biotin tags facilitated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept access to targeted bioconjugates as molecular probes. Computational explorations using DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations identified the most stable tripodal linker conformations and predicted their absorption and emission behavior. The uptake and speciation of these molecules in living prostate cancer cells was imaged by single&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excitation techniques coupled with two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P FLIM)</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an emerging technique to enhance the signal of stable isotope metabolic contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance (MR). The objective of this study is to continue establishing 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3, signal&#8208;enhanced via PHIP, as a hyperpolarized contrast agent, obtained in seconds, to monitor metabolism in human cancer. Our focus was on human pancreatic and colon tumor xenografts. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;vinylpyruvate&#8208;d6 was hydrogenated using parahydrogen. Thereafter, the polarization of the protons was transferred to 13C. Following a workup procedure, the free hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 was obtained in clean aqueous solution. After injection into animals bearing either pancreatic or colon cancer xenografts, slice&#8208;selective MR spectra were acquired and analyzed to determine rate constants of metabolic conversion into lactate and alanine. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 proved to follow the increased metabolic rate to lactate and alanine in the tumor xenografts.</dc:description>

         <title>Zn promoted GaZrOx Ternary Solid Solution Oxide Combined with SAPO&#8208;34 Effectively Converts CO2 to Light Olefins with Low CO Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, Zn was introduced into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. The ZnGaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2, thereby the ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 bifunctional catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance.







Abstract
We proposed a new strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to prepare light olefins by introducing Zn into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 to prepare a high&#8211;performance ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. By optimizing the Zn doping content, the ratio and mode of the two&#8211;phase composite, and the process conditions, the 3.5&#8201;%ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance and good high&#8211;temperature inhibition of the reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The catalyst achieved 26.6&#8201;% CO2 conversion, 82.1&#8201;% C2=&#8722;C4= selectivity and 11.8&#8201;% light olefins yield. The ZnGaZrOx formed by introducing an appropriate amount of Zn into GaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2. Importantly, the RWGS reaction was also significantly suppressed at high temperatures, with the CO selectivity being only 46.1&#8201;% at 390&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Directly&#8208;Fused Ni(II)Porphyrin Conjugated Polymers with Blocked meso&#8208;Positions: Impact on Electrocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the synthesis via chemical vapor deposition of directly fused porphyrins conjugated polymers from Ni(II)porphyrin with blocked meso&#8208;positions. The electrochemical findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (&#946;&#8208;&#946;/meso&#8208;meso/&#946;&#8208;&#946; or meso&#8208;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;meso) is essential for the Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymer to operate via a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling (ROC) mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and ensure durable catalytic properties.







Abstract
The oxidative coupling reaction of two Ni(II) porphyrins meso&#8208;substituted with three and four phenyl groups, Ni(II) 5,10,15&#8208;(triphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh3P) and Ni(II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetraphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh4P) respectively, was investigated in a oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) process. Irrespective of the number of meso&#8208;substituents, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry evidences the formation of oligomeric species containing up to five porphyrin units. UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and XPS analyses of the oCVD films highlighted a strong dependence of the intermolecular coupling reaction with the substrate temperature. Specifically, higher substrate temperatures yield lowering of valence band maxima and reduction of the band gap. The formation of conjugated polymeric assemblies results in increased conductivities as compared to their sublimed counterparts. Yet, electrocatalytic measurements exhibit water oxidation onset overpotentials (308&#8197;mV for pNiPh3P and 343&#8197;mV for pNiPh4P) comparatively higher than the onset overpotential measured for the oCVD film from Ni(II) 5,15&#8208;(diphenyl)porphyrin (pNiPh2P), i.&#8201;e. 283&#8197;mV. Although DFT and comparative oCVD studies suggest the formation of directly fused porphyrins involving &#8216;phenyl&#8208;mediated&#8217; and &#946;&#8208;&#946; linkages when reacting tetra&#8208;meso&#8208;substituted porphyrins, the present findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (&#946;&#8208;&#946;/meso&#8208;meso/&#946;&#8208;&#946; or meso&#8208;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;meso) is essential for Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers to enable a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling operating mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and durable catalytic activity.

         <title>Determining Structures of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Coated Zinc Dicarboxylate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of metal&#8208;organic thin films obtained from layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer spin&#8208;coating are determined by combining grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ab&#8197;initio density functional theory simulations. The Zn2+&#8208;to&#8208;dicarboxylic linker molar ratio used for spin&#8208;coating pivotally influences the resulting structure. High excess of Zn2+ generates dicarboxylate&#8208;intercalated layered zinc hydroxides, whereas equimolar ratios or slight excess of the linker yield metal&#8208;(hydroxide&#8208;)organic frameworks.







Abstract
Thin films of crystalline solids with substantial free volume built from organic chromophores and metal secondary building units (SBUs) are promising for engineering new optoelectronic properties through control of interchromophore coupling. Zn&#8208;based SBUs are especially relevant in this case because they avoid quenching the chromophore's luminescence. We find that layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer spin&#8208;coating using Zn acetate dihydrate and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) and biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC) linkers readily produces crystalline thin films. However, analysis of the grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) data reveals the structures of these films vary significantly with the linker, and with the metal&#8208;to&#8208;linker molar ratio used for fabrication. Under equimolar conditions, H2BPDC creates a type of structure like that proposed for SURMOF&#8208;2, whereas H2BDC generates a different metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework.

     alt="Determining Structures of Layer-by-Layer Spin-Coated Zinc Dicarboxylate-Based Metal-Organic Thin Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structures of metal-organic thin films obtained from layer-by-layer spin-coating are determined by combining grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and &lt;i&gt;ab&#8197;initio&lt;/i&gt; density functional theory simulations. The Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-to-dicarboxylic linker molar ratio used for spin-coating pivotally influences the resulting structure. High excess of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; generates dicarboxylate-intercalated layered zinc hydroxides, whereas equimolar ratios or slight excess of the linker yield metal-(hydroxide-)organic frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thin films of crystalline solids with substantial free volume built from organic chromophores and metal secondary building units (SBUs) are promising for engineering new optoelectronic properties through control of interchromophore coupling. Zn-based SBUs are especially relevant in this case because they avoid quenching the chromophore's luminescence. We find that layer-by-layer spin-coating using Zn acetate dihydrate and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC) and biphenyl-4,4&#8217;-dicarboxylic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BPDC) linkers readily produces crystalline thin films. However, analysis of the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data reveals the structures of these films vary significantly with the linker, and with the metal-to-linker molar ratio used for fabrication. Under equimolar conditions, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BPDC creates a type of structure like that proposed for SURMOF-2, whereas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC generates a different metal-hydroxide-organic framework. Large excess of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions causes the growth of layered zinc hydroxides, irrespective of the linker used. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide structural models with minimum total energy that are consistent with the experimentally observed diffractograms. In the broader sense, this work illustrates the importance in this field of careful structure determination, &lt;i&gt;e.&#8201;g&lt;/i&gt;., by utilizing GIWAXS and DFT simulations to determine the structure of the obtained crystalline metal-organic thin films, such that properties can be rationally engineered and explained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocompatible Synthesis of Macrocyclic Thiazol(in)e Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a biocompatible method to synthesize macrocyclic peptides with thiazoline heterocycles. Learn how a cleavable linker enables direct installation of a reactive nitrile group at the peptide C&#8208;terminus during solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Explore the transformation of the peptide's thiazoline into thiazole or cysteine through oxidation or hydrolysis, unlocking the potential of three classes of macrocyclic peptides in one synthesis.







Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides containing a thiazole or thiazoline in the backbone are considered privileged structures in both natural compounds and drug discovery, owing to their enhanced bioactivity, stability, and permeability. Here, we present the biocompatible synthesis of macrocyclic peptides from N&#8208;terminal cysteine and C&#8208;terminal nitrile. While the N&#8208;terminal cysteine is incorporated during solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, the C&#8208;terminal nitrile is introduced during cleavage with aminoacetonitrile, utilizing a cleavable benzotriazole linker. This method directly yields the fully functionalized linear peptide precursor. The biocompatible cyclization reaction occurs in buffer at physiological pH and room temperature. The resulting thiazoline heterocycle remains stable in buffer but hydrolyzes under acidic conditions. While such hydrolysis enables access to macrocyclic peptides with a complete amide backbone, mild oxidation of the thiazoline leads to the stable thiazole macrocyclic peptide. While conventional oxidation strategies involve metals, we developed a protocol simply relying on alkaline salt and air. Therefore, we offer a rapid and metal&#8208;free pathway to macrocyclic thiazole peptides, featuring a biocompatible key cyclization step.

The crosslinked Tyr&#8208;Leu&#8208;Trp peptide produced by the biarylitide crosslinking cytochrome P450Blt from Micromonospora sp. MW&#8208;13 has been reanalysed by NMR, computational and isotope labelling experiments and shown to contain a C&#8722;N rather than a C&#8722;O bond. In vivo experiments using this peptide show there is a general tolerance of biarylitide crosslinking P450 enzymes for histidine to tryptophan mutations within their minimal peptide substrate sequences.







Abstract
The structure of the sidechain crosslinked Tyr&#8208;Leu&#8208;Trp peptide produced by the biarylitide crosslinking cytochrome P450Blt from Micromonospora sp. MW&#8208;13 has been reanalysed by a series of NMR, computational and isotope labelling experiments and shown to contain a C&#8722;N rather than a C&#8722;O bond. Additional in&#8197;vivo experiments using such a modified peptide show there is a general tolerance of biarylitide crosslinking P450 enzymes for histidine to tryptophan mutations within their minimal peptide substrate sequences despite the lack of such residues noted in natural biarylitide gene clusters. This work further highlights the impressive ability of P450s from biarylitide biosynthesis pathways to act as biocatalysts for the formation of a range of sidechain crosslinked tripeptides.

         <title>Cold Pressing of Perovskite&#8208;ZIF Glass Interpenetrating Networks with Stable Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cold pressing synthesis: The (agZIF&#8208;62)0.5(CsPbBr3)0.5 composite material is prepared using a ball milling and cold pressing technique. The interpenetrating network of perovskite&#8208;ZIF glass within the composite material contributes to enhanced fluorescent emission and lifetime. The optoelectronic device fabricated from this composite material exhibits excellent air stability, retaining 97.6&#8201;% of the initial current after 2000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The protection of lead halide perovskite within a stable matrix normally leads to the loss of semiconducting properties. Here, we report the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;ZIF glass interpenetrating networks via a cold pressing method, which allows the advantages of bright photoluminescence, high photoconductivity and environmental stability. This hybrid architecture has provided a novel design strategy for the real&#8208;world application of perovskite&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Nitrogen Fixation by Manganese Complexes &#8211; Waiting for the Rush?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of nitrogen fixation, manganese complexes seem to be set back when compared to other early&#8208;to&#8208;mid transition metals. This does not reflect the rush this metal has experienced in homogeneous hydrogenation catalysis and related processes. Giving an overview of the relevant literature, the authors attempt to answer why this metal has not yet made its breakthrough in N2 activation.







Abstract
Manganese is currently experiencing a great deal of attention in homogeneous catalysis as a sustainable alternative to platinum group metals due to its abundance, affordable price and low toxicity. While homogeneous nitrogen fixation employing well&#8208;defined transition metal complexes has been an important part of coordination chemistry, manganese derivatives have been only sporadically used in this research area. In this contribution, the authors systematically cover manganese organometallic chemistry related to N2 activation spanning almost 60&#8197;years, identify apparent pitfalls and outline encouraging perspectives for its future development.

         <title>Ionic Porous Aromatic Frameworks Embedding Polyoxometalates for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate ionic porous aromatic framework (MTV&#8208;iPAFs) material (PAF&#8208;270) was synthesized from a multivariable synthesis strategy, which specific surface area was 724&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and had hierarchical structure. Leveraging its physical and chemical properties, PAF&#8208;270 was availability for polyoxometalates loading and heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are highly promising functional porous solids known for their feasible amenability and extraordinary stability. When the framework was modified by ionic functional groups, these ionic PAFs (iPAFs) exhibited charged channels for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, the surface areas of ionic porous frameworks are usually lower than that of neutral frameworks, and their synthesis is limited by specific strategies and complex modification processes. To address these challenges, an intuitive route to construct ionic porous framework with high specific surface area was proposed. Herein, a multivariate ionic porous aromatic framework (MTV&#8208;iPAFs, named PAF&#8208;270) was synthesized using readily available building units with ionic functional groups through a multivariable synthesis strategy. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited hierarchical structure with the highest specific surface area among reported imidazolium&#8208;functionalized PAFs. Utilizing its physical and chemical properties, the availability for polyoxometalate loading and heterogeneous catalysis of PAF&#8208;270 were explored. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited a high adsorption capacity up to 50&#8201;% for both H3O40PW12 (HPW) and (NH4)5H6PV8Mo4O40 (V8). HPW@PAF&#8208;270 and V8@PAF&#8208;270 exhibited excellent catalytic abilities for oleic acid esterification and extractive oxidative desulfurization, respectively. Due to the stability of PAFs, these materials also showed remarkable resistance to temperature and pH changes. Overall, these results underscore the potential application of MTV&#8208;iPAFs as versatile functional porous materials.

         <title>A Prebiotic Pathway to Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes play a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. A wide range of enzymes require the presence of complementary coenzymes and cofactors to function properly. While coenzymes are believed to have been part of the last universal ancestor (LUCA) or have been present even earlier, the syntheses of crucial coenzymes like the redox&#8208;active coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) remain challenging. Here, we present a pathway to NAD+ under prebiotic conditions starting with ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal and sugar&#8208;forming precursors, yielding in situ the nicotinamide riboside. Regioselective phosphorylation and water stable light activated adenosine monophosphate derivatives allow for topographically and irradiation&#8208;controlled formation of NAD+. Our findings indicate that NAD+, a coenzyme vital to life, can be formed non&#8208;enzymatically from simple organic feedstock molecules via photocatalytic activation under prebiotically plausible early Earth conditions in a continuous process under aqueous conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Is the E/Z Iminium Ratio a Good Enantioselectivity Predictor in Iminium Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new enantioselective reactions is an important part of chemical discovery but requires time and resources to test large arrays of potential reaction conditions. New techniques are required to analyse many different reactions quickly and efficiently. Mass spectrometry is a high&#8208;throughput method; when combined with ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4&#8208;addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions. The prediction matches well for one reaction but does not predict the obtained results for the second. This finding confirms that the E/Z ratio of the iminium intermediates can be used as a predictor for some reactions, but the kinetics of the following steps can dramatically change the true enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Helix&#8208;preference of an Axially&#8208;twisted Molecular Scaffold Through Diastereomeric Salt Formation with Tartaric Acid Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we designed a chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) using pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) unit as pivot, chiral trans&#8208;cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) residues as linkers, and pyrene residues as fluorescent reporters. R,R&#8208;ATMS exclusively adopted M&#8208;helicity and produced differential response in UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked&#8208;eye detection and enantiomeric excess determination. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of R,R&#8208;ATMS underwent unique changes during titration with TA stereoisomers &#8211; while loss of CD signal at 345 nm was observed with equimolar D&#8208;TA and meso&#8208;TA, inversion was seen with equimolar L&#8208;TA. Temperature increase weakened these interactions to partially recover the original CD signature of R,R&#8208;ATMS. 2D NMR studies also indicated the significant structural changes in R,R&#8208;ATMS in the solution state upon addition of L&#8208;TA. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies on the crystals of the R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;D&#8208;TA salt revealed the interacting partners stacked in arrays and ATMS molecules stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between its PDC and pyrene residues. Contrastingly, tightly&#8208;packed supramolecular cages comprised of four molecules each of R,R&#8208;ATMS and L&#8208;TA were seen in R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;L&#8208;TA salt, and the ATMS molecules contorted to achieve CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between its pyrene residues. These results may have implications in modulating the helicity of topologically&#8208;similar larger biomolecules.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we designed a chiral, axially-twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) using pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide (PDC) unit as pivot, chiral trans-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) residues as linkers, and pyrene residues as fluorescent reporters. R,R-ATMS exclusively adopted M-helicity and produced differential response in UV-vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked-eye detection and enantiomeric excess determination. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of R,R-ATMS underwent unique changes during titration with TA stereoisomers &#8211; while loss of CD signal at 345 nm was observed with equimolar D-TA and meso-TA, inversion was seen with equimolar L-TA. Temperature increase weakened these interactions to partially recover the original CD signature of R,R-ATMS. 2D NMR studies also indicated the significant structural changes in R,R-ATMS in the solution state upon addition of L-TA. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies on the crystals of the R,R-ATMS&#8835;D-TA salt revealed the interacting partners stacked in arrays and ATMS molecules stabilized by &#960;-&#960; stacking between its PDC and pyrene residues. Contrastingly, tightly-packed supramolecular cages comprised of four molecules each of R,R-ATMS and L-TA were seen in R,R-ATMS&#8835;L-TA salt, and the ATMS molecules contorted to achieve CH-&#960; interactions between its pyrene residues. These results may have implications in modulating the helicity of topologically-similar larger biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unimolecular Decomposition Mechanism of Trimethyl Phosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trimethyl phosphate (TMP), an organophosphorus compound (OPC), is a promising fire&#8208;retardant candidate for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrolytes to mitigate fire spread. This study aims to understand the mechanism of TMP unimolecular thermal decomposition to support the integration of a TMP chemical kinetic model into a LIB electrolyte surrogate model. Reactive intermediates and products of TMP thermal decomposition were experimentally detected using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation and double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectroscopy. Phosphorus&#8208;containing intermediates such as PO, HPO and HPO2 were identified. Sampling effects could successfully be obviated thanks to photoion imaging, which also showed evidence for isomerization reactions upon wall collisions in the ionization chamber. Quantum chemical calculations performed for the unimolecular decomposition of TMP revealed for the first time that isomerization channels via hydrogen and methyl transfer (barrier heights of 65.9 and 72.6 kcal/mol, respectively) are the lowest&#8208;energy primary steps of TMP decomposition followed by CH3OH/CH3/CH2O or dimethyl ether (DME) production, respectively. We found an analogous DME production channel in the unimolecular decomposition of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), another important OPC fire&#8208;retardant additive with a similar molecular structure to TMP, which are not included in currently available chemical kinetic models.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging developments in artificial intelligence have opened infinite possibilities for material simulation. Depending on the powerful fitting of machine learning algorithms to first&#8208;principles data, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can effectively balance the accuracy and efficiency problems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, serving as powerful tools in various complex physicochemical systems. Consequently, this brings unprecedented enthusiasm for researchers to apply such novel technology in multiple fields to revisit the major scientific problems that have remained controversial owing to the limitations of previous computational methods. Herein, we introduce the evolution of MLIPs, provide valuable application examples for solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and present current challenges. Driven by solving multitudinous difficulties in terms of the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of MLIPs, this booming technique, combined with molecular simulation methods, will provide an underlying and valuable understanding of interdisciplinary scientific challenges, including materials, physics, and chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Generation of Oxygenated Quaternary Centers via EnT Enabled Singlet O2 Addition to C3&#8208;Maleimidated Quinoxaline: A Reagent&#8208;Less Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reagent&#8208;less sensitizer&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced access of oxygenated centers via hindered tertiary hydroxylation (Csp3&#8208;H) and intramolecular spiro&#8208;etherification (Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H) of photo&#8208;responsive C3&#8208;maleimidated quinoxaline has been demonstrated. This is an illustrative example of a tautomeric reacting substrate&#8208;induced singlet oxygen up&#8208;taken divergent photo&#8208;oxygenation, guided by the use of a suitable solvent.







Abstract
Demonstrated here is an external photo&#8208;sensitizer&#8208;free (auto&#8208;sensitized) singlet oxygen&#8208;enabled solvent&#8208;dependent tertiary hydroxylation and aryl&#8208;alkyl spiro&#8208;etherification of C3&#8208;maleimidated quinoxalines. Such &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; photo&#8208;oxygenation at Csp3&#8208;H and etherification involving Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H are unparalleled. Possibly, the highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;H tautomer allows the substrate to get excited by irradiation, and subsequently, it attains the triplet state via ISC. This excited triplet&#8208;state sensitized molecule then transfers its energy to a triplet&#8208;state oxygen (3O2) generating reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) for hydroxylation and spirocyclization depending on the solvent used. In HFIP, the generated alkoxy radical accepts a proton via HAT giving hydroxylated product. In contrast, in an aprotic PhCl it underwent a radical addition at the ortho&#8208;position of the C2 aryl to provide spiro&#8208;ether. An unprecedented orthogonal spiro&#8208;etherification was observed via the displacement of o&#8208;substitutents for ortho (&#8722;OEt, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;F, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br) substituted substrates. The order of ipso substitution follows the trend &#8722;OMe&gt;&#8722;OEt&gt;&#8722;F&gt;&#8722;H&gt;&#8722;Cl&gt;&#8722;Br. Both these oxygenation reactions can be carried out with nearly equal ease using direct sunlight without the requirement of any elaborate reaction setup. Demonstration of large&#8208;scale synthesis and a few interesting transformations have also been realized. Furthermore, several insightful control experiments and quantum chemical computations were performed to unravel the mechanism.

         <title>Oriented Metal&#8208;organic Framework Membranes for Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses recent progress made in oriented metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes for energy&#8208;efficient separation. Diverse synthetic protocols, including counter&#8208;diffusion interfacial synthesis, current&#8208;driven synthesis, and modular assembly, are systematically introduced. Furthermore, their emerging applications towards addressing environmental and industrial challenges, are highlighted.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes, which are recognized as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platforms applied in various separation processes, have attracted widespread attention. Nonetheless, to overcome the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, which is crucial for achieving efficient separation, it is important to rationally design and manipulate MOF membrane structure. Given remarkable advances in the past decade, a timely summary of recent advancement in this field has become indispensable. This review introduces major strategies for fabricating oriented MOF membranes, including in&#8197;situ growth, contra&#8208;diffusion method, interface&#8208;assisted approach, and laminated nanosheet assembly. New insights into their updated progress and potential are elucidated. Of particular note, recent development and emerging applications of oriented MOF membranes, illustrating their potential to address environmental and energy challenges, are highlighted. Finally, remaining challenges facing their bath production and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes with Benzoxazole Derivatives and Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Effective Antioxidants in Human Neuroblasts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of benzoxazole derivatives with non&#8208;innocent ligands in the same ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex is a suitable strategy to design new pharmacological tools with ROS&#8208;scavenging activity against pro&#8208;apoptotic/pro&#8208;oxidant molecules challenge in human differentiated neuroblasts. The antioxidant properties of such systems are likely the result of a non&#8208;trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures. The decrease of oxidative stress by these ruthenium(II) systems exerts both pro&#8208;survival effect and anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in human differentiated neuroblasts.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes continue to raise increasing interest for the encouraging results in several biomedical areas. Considering their vast chemical&#8208;physical repertoire, in particular the possibility to switch from the sensitization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to ROS&#8208;scavenging abilities by tuning the nature of their ligands, it is therefore surprising that their potential as antioxidants has not been largely investigated so far. Herein, we explored the antioxidant behaviour of the novel ruthenium compound [Ru(dbpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru1), featuring a benzoxazole derivative (dpby=2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;benzoxazolyl)pyridine) and the non&#8208;innocent 2,3&#8208;diamminonaftalene (2,3&#8208;DAN) ligand, along with the reference tpy&#8208;containing analogue [Ru(tpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru2) (tpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine). Following the synthesis and the electrochemical characterization, chemical antioxidant assays highlighted the beneficial role of dpby for the ROS&#8208;scavenging properties of Ru1. These data have been corroborated by the highest protective effect of Ru1 against the oxidative stress induced in SH&#8208;SY5Y human neuroblastoma, which exerts pro&#8208;survival and anti&#8208;inflammatory actions. The results herein reported highlight the potential of Ru1 as pharmacological tool in neurodegenerative diseases and specially prove that the antioxidant properties of such compounds are likely the result of a non&#8208;trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes continue to raise increasing interest for the encouraging results in several biomedical areas. Considering their vast chemical-physical repertoire, in particular the possibility to switch from the sensitization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to ROS-scavenging abilities by tuning the nature of their ligands, it is therefore surprising that their potential as antioxidants has not been largely investigated so far. Herein, we explored the antioxidant behaviour of the novel ruthenium compound [Ru(dbpy)(2,3-DAN)Cl]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Ru1&lt;/b&gt;), featuring a benzoxazole derivative (dpby=2,6-bis(4-methyl-2-benzoxazolyl)pyridine) and the non-innocent 2,3-diamminonaftalene (2,3-DAN) ligand, along with the reference tpy-containing analogue [Ru(tpy)(2,3-DAN)Cl]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Ru2&lt;/b&gt;) (tpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;-terpyridine). Following the synthesis and the electrochemical characterization, chemical antioxidant assays highlighted the beneficial role of dpby for the ROS-scavenging properties of &lt;b&gt;Ru1&lt;/b&gt;. These data have been corroborated by the highest protective effect of &lt;b&gt;Ru1&lt;/b&gt; against the oxidative stress induced in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma, which exerts pro-survival and anti-inflammatory actions. The results herein reported highlight the potential of &lt;b&gt;Ru1&lt;/b&gt; as pharmacological tool in neurodegenerative diseases and specially prove that the antioxidant properties of such compounds are likely the result of a non-trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Central Metals in Bulky Phthalocyanines for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II) and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy peripheral substituents were synthesized and tested as sensitizer in DSSCs to shed light on the role of central metals in photovoltaic performance. Regardless of peripheral substitution, the trend of photovoltaic efficiencies followed the order Zn(II)Pc&gt;Mg(II)Pc&#8811;H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc.







Abstract
Two series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II), and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and well&#8208;established bulky peripheral substituents (either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy) were synthesized and tested as sensitizers in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The trend of photovoltaic efficiencies (PCEs) for free&#8208;base and metallo Pcs followed the order Zn(II)Pc&gt;Mg(II)Pc&#8811;H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc regardless of the peripheral substitution. Higher efficiencies (4.95 versus 3.63 for the Zn(II) derivatives) were achieved with Pcs bearing the bulkier 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy group, indicating a lower aggregation and more suitable HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels. Furthermore, these derivatives showed a morelevant influence of the metal on the PCE values (from the highest 4.95 for the Zn(II)Pc to the lowest 0.23 for the Ru(II)Pc. In both series, the best PCEs observed with the Zn(II) derivatives were mainly due to their highest Jsc values. The lowest efficiencies found for the free&#8208;bases and Ru(II) derivatives were attributed to a mismatch between their LUMO levels and the conduction band of the TiO2,and lower light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, respectively. In conclusion, Zn(II) derivatives are still the best Pc candidates to use as sensitizers in molecular photovoltaics.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Dyes for Photoacoustic Imaging and their Use as Analyte&#8208;Responsive Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing near&#8208;infrared absorbing dyes tailored for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) applications will advance this emerging non&#8208;invasive deep&#8208;tissue imaging approach. Herein, we present strategies for tuning the classical xanthene scaffold for uses in PAI, and how activity&#8208;based sensing strategies can be applied to design xanthene&#8208;based, analyte&#8208;responsive probes to illuminate changes in disease biochemistry.







Abstract
Developing imaging tools that can report on the presence of disease&#8208;relevant analytes in multicellular organisms can provide insight into fundamental disease mechanisms as well as provide diagnostic tools for the clinic. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a light&#8208;in, sound&#8208;out imaging technique that allows for high resolution, deep&#8208;tissue imaging with applications in pre&#8208;clinical and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. The continued development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing small&#8208;molecule dyes promises to improve the capabilities of this emerging imaging modality. For example, new dye scaffolds bearing chemoselective functionalities are enabling the detection and quantification of disease&#8208;relevant analytes through activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS) approaches. Recently described strategies to engineer NIR absorbing xanthenes have enabled development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI probes using this classic dye scaffold. Herein, we present current strategies for red&#8208;shifting the spectral properties of xanthenes via bridging heteroatom or auxochrome modifications. Additionally, we explore how these strategies, coupled with chemoselective spiroring&#8208;opening approaches, have been employed to create ABS probes for in&#8197;vivo detection of hypochlorous acid, nitric oxide, copper (II), human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1, and carbon monoxide. Given the versatility of the xanthene scaffold, we anticipate continued growth and development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI imaging probes based on this dye class.

         <title>RuPHOX&#8208;Ru Catalyzed Asymmetric Cascade Hydrogenation of 3&#8208;Substituted Chromones for the Synthesis of Corresponding Chiral Chromanols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient RuPHOX&#8722;Ru catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been achieved under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. A dynamic kinetic resolution process occurs during the subsequent hydrogenation of the C=O double bond, which is responsible for the high performance of the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation.







Abstract
An efficient RuPHOX&#8722;Ru catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been achieved under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Control reactions and deuterium labelling experiments revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution process occurs during the subsequent hydrogenation of the C=O double bond, which is responsible for the high performance of the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation. The resulting products allow for several transformations and it was shown that the protocol provides a practical and alternative strategy for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols and their derivatives.

         <title>A Catalytic Approach for the Synthesis of Peptide&#8722;Oligonucleotides Conjugates in Aqueous Solution or On&#8208;Column</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the preparation of peptide&#8722;oligonucleotide conjugates is presented herein. A catalytic DABCO/chlorotriazine system allowed the synthesis both on solid support in anhydrous media and in aqueous solution. More than 35 examples showcased the utility of the method with wide varieties of acid partners, peptides, and oligonucleotides, as well as an iterative process for DEL application.







Abstract
Peptide&#8722;oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs) are covalent architectures composed of a DNA or RNA molecules linked to a peptide. These constructs have found widespread applications ranging from hybrid nanomaterials to gene&#8208;targeted therapies. Considering the important role of POCs, a new catalytic approach for their preparation is reported here, that could be applied either on solid support in anhydrous media, or post&#8208;synthetically in aqueous buffer. Single amino acids, peptides and cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) were conjugated to various oligo(ribo)nucleotides with high conversions and good isolated yields. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on more than 35 examples including an analogue of a commercial therapeutic oligonucleotide. Other conjugation partners, such as deoxycholic acid and biotin were also successfully conjugated to oligonucleotides. To highlight the potential of this catalytic approach, these conditions have been applied to iterative processes, which is of high interest for the development of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries.

In this concept, we address the current understanding about the alkaline HOR mechanism and summarize recent advances of Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts with enhanced alkaline HOR activity. We also discuss the perspectives and challenges on Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts in the future.







Abstract
The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs) are promising but lack of high&#8208;performance anode hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) electrocatalysts. The platinum group metals (PGMs) have the HOR activity in alkaline medium two to three orders of magnitude lower than those in acid, leading to the high required PGMs amount on anode to achieve high HEMFC performance. The mechanism study demonstrates the hydrogen binding energy of the catalyst determines the alkaline HOR kinetics, and the adsorbed OH and water on the catalyst surface promotes HOR. Iridium (Ir) has a unique advantage for alkaline HOR due to its similar hydrogen binding energy to Pt and enhanced adsorption of OH. However, the HOR activity of Ir/C is still unsatisfied in practical HEMFC applications. Further fine tuning the adsorption of the intermediate on Ir&#8208;based catalysts is of great significance to improve their alkaline HOR activity, which can be reasonably realized by structure design and composition regulation. In this concept, we address the current understanding about the alkaline HOR mechanism and summarize recent advances of Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts with enhanced alkaline HOR activity. We also discuss the perspectives and challenges on Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts in the future.

         <title>Ring Fusion Elevates the Electronic Mobility of Azabenzannulated Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ortho five&#8208;membered ring&#8208;fused azabenzannulated perylene diimide (AzaBPDI) is synthesized by intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation cyclization. The ring&#8208;fused AzaBPDI derivative exhibits planar configuration and superior electronic mobility in organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices in comparison to the parent non&#8208;fused one. This result provides a robust design strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance AzaBPDI derivatives.







Abstract
The backwardness of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors still exists compared with the p&#8208;type counterparts. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is of great importance for organic electronic devices and their integrated circuits. In recent years, azabenzannulated perylene diimide (PDI), as one of immense bay&#8208;region&#8208;annulated PDI derivatives, has drawn considerable attentions. However, the electronic mobilities of azabenzannulated PDI derivatives are barely satisfactory. In this contribution, the peripheral benzene ring in azabenzannulated PDI 2 was fused to the ortho position by intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation cyclization. This endows the resultant azabenzannulated PDI 4 a planar configuration as well as electron deficient pentagonal ring. As a result, the electronic mobility of 4 is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the nonfused azabenzannulated PDI 2. This work shall pave a new avenue in elevating the performance of azabenzannulated PDI in organic electronics.

         <title>Stable Axially Chiral Cyclohexylidenes from Catalytic Asymmetric Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones with N&#8208;protected oxindoles and benzofuranones catalyzed by a bispidine&#8208;based chiral amine was reported. A series of cyclohexylidenes with stable axial chirality were obtained in good yields and fairly good er.







Abstract
Axially chiral cycloalkylidenes are interesting but less developed axially chiral molecules. Here, a bispidine&#8208;based chiral amine catalytic system was developed to promote efficiently the asymmetric Knoevenagel condensation of N&#8208;protected oxindoles and benzofuranones with 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones. A variety of alkylidenecycloalkanes with stable axial chirality were obtained in good yields and fairly good er (enantiomeric ratio). Based on the absolute configuration determination of product and DFT calculations, a possible mechanism of stereoselective induction was proposed.

         <title>Ytterbium(II) Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Single and Double Hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ytterbium and calcium amides supported by hemilabile silaimine&#8208;functionalized cyclopentadienyl ligands (C5Me4&#8208;Si(L)=NR) enabled catalytic single and double hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphines, producing homoallenyl phosphines and (E)&#8208;propenylene diphosphines selectively under mild conditions.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Enynes with conjugated alkene and alkyne moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry. However, neither 4,1&#8208;hydrophosphination nor dihydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes has been reported. In this paper, the divalent ytterbium and calcium amide complexes supported by silaimine&#8208;functionalized cyclopentadienyl ligands (C5Me4&#8208;Si(L)=NR) were developed, which successfully catalyzed the efficient single and double hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphines. The hydrophosphination reactions selectively produced homoallenyl phosphines and (E)&#8208;propenylene diphosphines, respectively. This work demonstrated the potential of hemilabile silaimine&#8208;Cp ligands in the supporting the efficient and selective rare&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth catalysts.

         <title>Tetrazole&#8208;Functionalized Organoboranes Exhibiting Dynamic Intramolecular N&#8594;B&#8208;Coordination and Cyanide&#8208;Selective Anion Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyano&#8208;functionalities in organoboranes have been converted into tetrazoles. The chemical modification allows to tailor the Lewis&#8208;acidity of the boron center through intermolecular N&#8594;B&#8208;interaction. As a result, the compounds exhibit significantly altered physical properties, including selective binding of Cyanide over Fluoride.







Abstract
Starting from two different cyano&#8208;functionalized organoboranes, we demonstrate that 1,3&#8208;dipolar [3+2] azide&#8208;nitrile cycloaddition can serve to generate libraries of alkyl&#8208;tetrazole&#8208;functionalized compounds capable of intramolecular N&#8594;B&#8208;Lewis adduct formation. Due to the relatively low basicity of tetrazoles, structures can be generated that exhibit weak and labile N&#8594;B&#8208;coordination. The reaction furnishes 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;alkylated regio&#8208;isomers that exhibit different effective Lewis&#8208;acidities at the boron centers, and vary in their optical absorption and fluorescence properties. Indeed, we identified derivatives capable of selectively binding cyanide over fluoride, as confirmed by 11B NMR. This finding demonstrates the potentialities of this synthetic strategy to systematically fine&#8208;tune the properties of lead structures that are of interest as chemical sensors.

The experimental ferraborane thermal isomerization (&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe(&#951;3&#8208;B5H10)&#8594;(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;B5H10) is intriguing: quantum&#8208;chemical computations confirm experimental proposed reactant and product structures and NMR spectroscopy assignment. The borane ligand, the unknown B5H10&#8722; anion as a free species, has an inverted geometrical stability when attached to the (&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe+ moiety, with a striking planarization, leading to a more stable ferraborane complex.







Abstract
In 1977 Weiss and Grimes, by means of mass spectrometry and 1H and 11B NMR spectroscopy, proposed two structures (I and II) for the ferraborane (&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe(B5H10), isoelectronic with ferrocene. In this work, by means of high&#8208;level quantum&#8208;chemical computations, we confirm the experimental structures of the two isomers with their corresponding energies, and assign the reported 1H and 11B NMR chemical shifts. A striking result from this study is the planarization (3D&#8594;2D) of the B5H10&#8722; ligand &#8211; an unknown isolated anion, isoelectronic with aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion C5H5&#8722; &#8211; when attached to the (&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Fe+ moiety, thus resulting in a more stable ferraborane isomer II.

         <title>Tunable Optical Anisotropy in Rare&#8208;Earth Borates with Flexible [BO3] Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five mixed&#8208;metal Y&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth borates have been discovered with isolated [BO3] clusters arranged in various configurations, which allows for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates&#8242; anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in optical anisotropy.







Abstract
Borates have garnered a lot of attention in the realm of solid&#8208;state chemistry due to their remarkable characteristics, in which the synthesis of borates with isolated [BO3] by adding rare&#8208;earth elements is one of the main areas of structural design study. Five new mixed&#8208;metal Y&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth borates, Ba2ZnY2(BO3)4, KNa2Y(BO3)2, Li2CsY4(BO3)5, LiRb2Y(BO3)2, and RbCaY(BO3)2, have been discovered using the high&#8208;temperature solution approach. Isolated [BO3] clusters arranged in various configurations comprise their entire anionic framework, allowing for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081 under 1064&#8197;nm. In this study, we characterize the relative placements of their [BO3] groups and examine how their structure affects their characteristics. The origin of their considerable optical anisotropy has been proven theoretically. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates&#8242; anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in performance.

The isocyanide substrate scope revealed an exquisite functional group compatibility (18 examples, with yields up to 99%). Both radical and polar trapping, kinetic isotopic effect and real&#8208;time NMR studies support the mechanistic hypothesis and provide insightful details for the design of new chemical processes involving the generation of oxocarbenium ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide by Confinement of Cobalt Porphyrins in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable alternatives for the energy intensive synthesis of H2O2 are necessary. Molecular cobalt catalysts show potential but are typically restricted by undesired bimolecular pathways leading to the breakdown of both H2O2 and the catalyst. The confinement of cobalt porphyrins in the PCN&#8208;224 metal&#8208;organic framework leads to an enhanced selectivity towards H2O2 and stability of the catalyst. Consequently, oxygen can now be selectively reduced to hydrogen peroxide with a stable conversion for at least 5 h, illustrating the potential of catalysts confined in MOFs to increase the selectivity and stability of electrocatalytic conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancements and Challenges in the Synthesis of Oxymethylene Ethers (OMEs) as Sustainable Transportation Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector is driving research into novel energy carriers that can meet the high energy density requirements of heavy&#8208;duty vehicles without exacerbating the climate change. This concept article examines the synthesis, mechanisms, and challenges associated with oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), a promising class of synthetic fuels potentially derived from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. We highlight the importance of OMEs in the transition towards non&#8208;fossil energy sources due to their compatibility with the existing Diesel infrastructure and their cleaner combustion profile. The synthesis mechanisms, including the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution and its implications for OME chain length specificity, and the role of various catalysts and starting materials are discussed in depth. Despite advancements in the field, significant challenges remain, such as overcoming the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution, efficiently managing water byproducts, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the OME synthesis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for OMEs to become a viable alternative fuel, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy future in the transportation sector.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (15R)&#8208; and (15S)&#8208;Prostaglandin A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>From both pharmaceutical and structural perspectives, the large family of prostaglandins represent a truly remarkable class of natural products. Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone naturally found in human seminal plasma and in the sea whip Plexaura homomalla with yet poorly understood biological or therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel strategy for the stereoselective construction of both naturally occurring prostaglandin A2 epimers and first insights into their functional effects on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAAR) are provided. The synthesis of both epimers was achieved in only 11 steps starting from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;tetrahydrofuran employing an organocatalytic domino&#8208;aldol reaction, a Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction, a Wittig reaction as well as an oxidation&#8208;decarboxylation sequence. The (15R)&#8208;epimer significantly reduced GABA&#8208;induced currents through GABAA receptors while its (15S)&#8208;epimer did not show any significant effect. These data suggest that 15R&#8208;PGA2 might serve as a novel scaffold for the development of selective GABAA receptor modulators.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual pH and Ca2+&#8208;Responsive PEG&#8208;Modified Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanodrug Delivery System: Excellent Cargo Encapsulation and Minimal Drug Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemotherapy is one of the most employed strategies in clinical treatment of cancer. However, reducing medication adverse effects and improving the biological activity remains a significant issue for chemotherapy. We developed a pH and Ca2+&#8208;responsive pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) WP5&#8835;EV@DOX to address the aforementioned challenges. The formation of this NDDS began with the spontaneous formation of supramolecular nanodrug carrier WP5&#8835;EV in water from PEG&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene and the bipyridilium salt derivative EV through simple host&#8208;guest interaction. Then the antitumor drug doxorubicin DOX was efficiently loaded with a high encapsulation rate of 84.6%. Cytotoxicity results indicated that the constructed nanoplatform not only reduced DOX toxicity and side effects on normal cell (293T), but also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity on cancer cell (HepG2). Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that WP5&#8835;EV@DOX had a longer half&#8208;life and higher bioavailability in the blood of mice compared to the nake drug DOX, with increases to 212% and 179%, respectively. Therefore, WP5&#8835;EV@DOX has great potential in tumor therapy and provides a new idea for host&#8208;guest drug delivery system.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Arynes with Silanes and Silicon&#8208;based Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzyne derived from hexadehydrogenated Diels Alder (HDDA) reactions was found to be an efficient hydrosilylation acceptors. Various silanes can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Polyhydromethylsiloxane (PHMS), a widely used organosilicon polymer, was also successfully modified using our method. About 5% of Si&#8208;H bonds in the polymer were inserted by benzynes, giving a functional PHMS with much more solubility in methanol and with a blue&#8208;emitting fluorescence behavior. Mechanism research shows that the insertion of benzyne into the Si&#8208;H bond probably undergoes a synergistic pathway, which is quite different from the traditional radical&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Excited State Dynamics of a Mutagenic Guanosine Etheno Adduct Investigated by Femtosecond Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments were combined with CASPT2 and time dependent DFT calculations to characterize the excited state dynamics of the mutagenic etheno adduct 1,N2&#8208;etheno&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#949;dG). This endogenously formed lesion is attracting great interest because of its ubiquity in human tissues and its highly mutagenic properties. The &#949;dG fluorescence is strongly modified with respect to that of the canonical nucleoside dG, notably by an about 6&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield at neutral pH. In addition, femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments reveal the presence of two emission bands with maxima at 335 nm for the shorter&#8208;lived and 425 nm for the longer&#8208;lived. Quantum mechanical calculations rationalize these findings and provide absorption and fluorescence spectral shapes similar to the experimental ones. Two different bright minima are located on the potential energy surface of the lowest energy singlet excited state. One planar, slightly less stable, is associated with the emission at 335 nm, whereas the other, with a bent etheno ring, is associated with the red&#8208;shifted emission.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The rising demand and financial costs of noble transition metal catalysts have emphasized the need for sustainable catalytic approaches. Over the past few years, base&#8208;metal catalysts have emerged as ideal candidates to replace their noble&#8208;metal counterparts because of their abundance and easiness of handling. Despite the significant advancements achieved with precious transition metals, earth&#8208;abundant cobalt catalysts have emerged as efficient alternatives for allylic substitution reactions. In this review, allylic alkylations at sp3&#8208;carbon centers mediated by cobalt will be discussed, with a special focus on the mechanistic features, scope, and limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides: comprehensive magnetochemical and quantum chemical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized and structurally characterized. A comprehensive magnetochemical and quantum chemical study of extended raw of the nitroxides with different substituents R in the pyridine fragment was performed. It was shown, that temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic properties are determined by the short contacts between nitroxide groups of adjacent molecules as well as between nitroxide group and methyl substituents in the pseudo axial positions of imidazoline fragments. Quantum chemistry allows to select the appropriate model of exchange cluster for analysis of experimental magnetic data and evaluation of the exchange interaction parameters. For NN&#8208;PyCl the &#8220;order&#8208;disorder&#8221; transition was detected by means of low temperature XRD. The difference in the experimental and calculated exchange interaction energies may serve as an indicator of temperature&#8208;induced structural rearrangements. For instance, for methyl substituted nitronyl nitroxide NN&#8208;PyMe structural transformations and significant changes in exchange interaction energies were observed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Boron subphthalocyanines with chloride and fluoride axial ligands and three antimony complexes chelated by corroles that differ in size and electron&#8208;richness were examined as electrocatalysts for reduction of protons to hydrogen. Experiment&#8208; and computation&#8208;based investigations revealed that all redox events are ligand&#8208;centered and that the meso&#8208;C of the corroles and the peripheral N atoms of the subphthalocyanines are the largely preferred proton&#8208;binding sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Tryptamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and rapid protocol for the oxidative halogenation of tryptamines with 10% aqueous NaClO has been developed. This reaction is featured by its operational simplicity, metal&#8208;free conditions, no purification, and high yield. Notably, the resulting key intermediates are suitable for further functionalization with various nucleophiles, including amines, N&#8208;aromatic heterocycles, indoles and phenols. The overall transformation exhibits broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biorelevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates is reported herein. The reaction is catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 acting as a Lewis acid and is giving access to stable tri&#8208;substituted aminocyclobutenes in high yield.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted ultrafast Synthesis of Bimetallic Nickel&#8208;Cobalt Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Application in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M&#8217;)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, with the same pillar and layer linkers 4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave&#8208;assisted thermal conversion synthesis method within only 12 min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M&#8217; was 4:1. The mono&#8208; and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic&#8208;activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301 mV and Tafel slopes of 42 mV dec&#8722;1 on a glassy carbon electrode in 1 mol L&#8211;1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, NiCoMOF was in situ grown in just 25 min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) where overpotentials of 313 and 328 mV at current densities of 50 and 300 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, were delivered and superior long&#8208;term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27 mV dec&#8722;1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement (Rfar = 2 &#937;), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacking Structure of Vaterite Revealed by Atomic Imaging and Diffraction Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anhydrous calcium carbonate crystals exist as three polymorphs: calcite, aragonite, and vaterite. Although vaterite is a metastable phase rarely found in the geological environment, it is intriguing that various biominerals are composed of vaterite. The processes of stable vaterite formation in biological systems cannot be understood without elucidating the nature of vaterite. The crystal structure of vaterite has been discussed for nearly a century but is still an open question. Here we propose the actual structure of vaterite by combining atomic imaging and diffraction analysis with simulations of disordered stacking sequences. Vaterite basically appears as layers of hexagonal calcium planes and carbonate (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;containing sheets stacked with +60&#176;, &#8722;60&#176;, or 180&#176; rotations from the underlying layer. However, equivalent carbonate positions in alternating layers are forbidden, and four&#8208;layer stacking in which the fourth layer rotates 180&#176; relative to the first layer are predominant, forming an orthogonal reciprocal lattice in diffraction patterns. These stacking characteristics replicate the intensity distribution in the electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This study has almost completely elucidated the crystal structure and stacking sequence of vaterite. Our findings provide insights into the thermodynamic stability of vaterite, which facilitates comprehension of the biomineralization processes and growth dynamics of calcium carbonate.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Molecular Glue Assisted Bacterial Conjugative Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial conjugation, a commonly used method to horizontally transfer functional genes from donor to recipient strains, plays an important role in the genetic manipulation of bacteria for basic research and industrial production. Successful conjugation depends on the donor&#8208;recipient cell recognition and a tight mating junction formation. However, the efficiency of conjugative transfer is usually very low. In this work, we developed a new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to increase the match frequency and the interaction stability between the donor and recipient cells. We used two&#160;E. coli&#160;strains, ETZ and BL21, as a model system, and modified them with the complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides by click chemistry. The conjugation efficiency of the modified bacteria was improved more than 4 times from 10% to 46%. This technique is simple and generalizable as it only relies on the active amino groups on the bacterial surface. It is expected to have broad applications in constructing&#160;engineered bacteria.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Boron difluoride (BF2) complexes with asymmetrical N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands have received increasing attention due to their fascinating properties and broad applications. They are generally constructed in two steps: ligand formation, followed by boron complexation. This review focuses on categorizing these BF2 complexes based on the key synthetic strategies that have been applied in the ligand formation steps. The post&#8208;functionalization, properties and applications of different types of BF2 complexes are presented. Their challenges and opportunities are also discussed. This should help the future rational design and synthesis of BF2 complexes with intriguing properties and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering applications of solar photocatalysis &amp; photothermal catalysis for hydrogen production from biomass:A review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant&#8208;scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with special attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass production of hydrogen. The types of photoreforming including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis were discussed consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors. We also reviewed the photoreactors that support biomass photoreforming. Numerical simulation methods were implemented for the solid&#8208;liquid two&#8208;phase flow and inter&#8208;particle radiative transfer involved in the reaction process. Developing concentrated photothermal catalytic flowed reactors is beneficial to scale&#8208;up catalytic hydrogen production from biomass.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi Stimuli Responsive Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Photochromic Behavior of a Tetraphenyl Substituted Triphenylamine Derivative and Its Application as Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive tetraphenyl substituted tripehnylamine&#8208;based aggregation induced emissive (AIE) material coupled with spiropyran was prepared. Owing to the presence of AIE and photochromic moiety, the molecule exhibits emissive aggregates, photochromism, and acidochromism. The multiple stimuli sensitive behavior of the molecule was explored for anti&#8208;counterfeiting behavior on TLC plate and commercial banknotes. The fluorogenic and photogenic response under UV and visible light established the potential of the candidate as a new generation encryption material.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Promoted On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyboroxine Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present our findings on the on&#8208;surface synthesis of polyboroxine molecules derived from boroxine molecules precursors. This process is promoted by oxygen species present on the Au(111) surface: oxygen atoms facilitate the detachment of naphthalene units of trinaphthyl&#8208;boroxine molecules and bridge two unsaturated boroxine centers to form a boroxine&#8208;O&#8208;boroxine chemical motif. X&#8208;ray spectroscopic characterization shows that, as the synthesis process proceeds, it progressively tunes the electronic properties of the interface, thus providing a promising route to control the electron level alignment. .</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Engineering in Bi&#8208;based Photo/electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the categories, construction strategies and advanced characterization techniques of defect engineering in current Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are summarized, and the main challenges and opportunities for the future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, providing a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.







Abstract
Main group Bi&#8208;based materials have gained popularity as N2 reduction reaction (NRR) photo/electrocatalysts due to their ability to inhibit competitive H2 evolution reactions (HER) and the unique N2 adsorption activities. The introduction of defects in Bi&#8208;based catalysts represents a highly effective strategy for enhancing light absorption, promoting efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, optimizing the activity of free radicals, regulating electronic structure, and improving catalytic performance. In this review, we outline the various applications of state of the defect engineering in Bi&#8208;based catalysts and elucidate the impact of vacancies on NRR performance. In particular, the types of defects, methods of defects tailoring, advanced characterization techniques, as well as the Bi&#8208;based catalysts with abundant defects and their corresponding catalytic behavior in NRR were elucidated in detail. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities for future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, which provides a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.

         <title>A Schottky/Z&#8208;Scheme Hybrid for Augmented Photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z&#8208;scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties of Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Bishomocubanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single&#160;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were found in the range of 1.34&#8208;1.59 g/cm3. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on &#160;ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry analysis (DTA).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl-bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single&#160;crystal X-ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were found in the range of 1.34-1.59 g/cm3. Density-functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on &#160;ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl-bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO-LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry analysis (DTA). Three compounds, a dinitroazide (Isp,vac= 310.98s), a dinitrate (Isp,vac = 309.51s), and a dinitronitrate (Isp,vac= 309.20s) were&#160;found to be excellent candidates for volume limited applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring Rearrangement Reactions of 4&#8208;Alkenylisocoumarins and Photophysical Evaluation of Multi&#8208;Substituted Anthracene Products</title>

         <dc:description>Herein we report that readily available 4&#8208;alkenylisocouma&#173;rins can be regarded as potent dienolate equivalents. For example, lactol silyl ethers derived from 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins were selectively converted to the corresponding benzo&#8208;homophthalates through a flu&#173;oride&#8208;induced ring opening step that was followed by a ring closure through a vinylogous intramolecular aldol condensation. Likewise, nu&#173;cleophilic activation of 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins directly yields diversely poly&#8208;substituted naphthalenes and anthracenes without formation of any regioisomer. Photophysical evaluation of a set of thus obtained 1,3&#8208;di&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted anthracenes reveals their distinct intra&#173;molecular charge transfer (ICT) character during light absorption in polar solutions and excimer emission from the solid state when a face to face &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular assembly is present in the crystal packing.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of a novel CAAC ligands featuring a spiro&#8208;fluorene group have been synthesized and complexed with ruthenium alkylidenes, yielding the corresponding Hoveyda&#8208;type derivatives as a new family of olefin metathesis catalysts.

The synthetized complexes were tested in catalysis and showed good activity in olefin metathesis, as demonstrated on diethyl diallylmalonate and allyl acetate substrates. The unique backbone in the ligand system with the large, yet inflexible condensed system renders interesting properties to the catalyst, exemplified by the good catalytic performance and improved&#160;Z&#8209;selectivity. In addition, the complex can also serve as a hydrogenation catalyst in a consecutive (one&#8208;pot) reaction.

         <title>Studying Cation Exchange in {Cr7Co} Pseudorotaxanes: Preparatory Studies for Making Hybrid Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1H NMR spectroscopy is applied to study the relative binding affinities between a {Cr7Co} macrocycle (Cr7Co=Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16) and a series of linear alkylammonium threads. The ammonium cation is observed to exchange in solution using 1H NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies show that the exchange takes place via a dissociative mechanism. The position of the equilibrium is dependent upon the solvent and structure of the ammonium. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) is used to measure the energy needed to induce 50&#8201;% of the precursor ion loss (E50). The trend in pseudorotaxane stabilities is similar when compared to the NMR trends in acetone&#8208;d6. These preliminary studies yield information which are valuable in the future design of hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic molecular machines.







Abstract
In the design of dynamic supramolecular systems used in molecular machines, it is important to understand the binding preferences between the macrocycle and stations along the thread. Here, we apply 1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the relative stabilities of a series of linear alkylammonium templated pseudorotaxanes with the general formula [H2NRR&#8217;][Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16] by exchanging the cation in solution. Our results show that the pseudorotaxanes are able to exchange threads via a dissociative mechanism. The position of equilibrium is dependent upon the ammonium cation and solvent used. Short chain primary ammonium cations are shown to be far less favourable macrocycle stations than secondary ammonium cations. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) has been used to look at disassembly of the pseudorotaxanes in a solvent&#8208;free environment and stability trends compared to those in acetone&#8208;d6. The energy needed to induce 50&#8201;% of the precursor ion loss (E50) is used and shows a similar trend to the equilibria measured by NMR. The relative stabilities of these hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes are different to those of host&#8208;guest compounds involving crown ethers and this may be valuable for the design of molecular machines.

         <title>Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide&#8208;Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non&#8208;coordinating benzyl groups and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single cis&#8208;pendant isomer with both amide protons in the trans&#8208;configuration, as supported by an X&#8208;ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the trans&#8208;1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z&#8208;spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly&#8208;shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40 mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically&#8208;induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3 ppm. Addition of the amphiphilic 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;based complex Co(L5) to the liposomal bilayer at 18 mM with Co(L1) encapsulated in the liposome at 50 mM changes the sign and increases the magnitude of the saturation frequency offset to &#8208;7.5 ppm at 300 mOsm/L.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble, phosphine&#8208;pegylated iridium(I) catalyst and its application in hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in buffer is reported. The longer polyethylene glycol side chains on the phosphine increased the water solubility independently from the pH. HIE reactions of polar substrates in protic solvents were studied. DFT calculations gave further insides into the catalytic processes. The scope and limitation of the pegylated catalyst was studied in HIE reactions of several complex compounds in borax buffer at pH 9 and the best conditions were applied in a tritium experiment with the drug telmisartan.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Interpretation: How much do we understand the Ce L3 XANES?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Historically, cerium has been attractive for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. The cerium atom has the unique ability to cycle between two chemical states (Ce(III) and Ce(IV)) and drastically adjust its electronic configuration: [Xe] 4f1 5d1 6s2 in response to a chemical reaction. Understanding how electrons drive chemical reactions is an important topic. The most direct way of probing the chemical and electronic structure of materials is by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) or X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) in high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) mode. Such measurements at the Ce L3 edge have the advantage of a high penetration depth, enabling in&#8208;situ reaction studies in a time&#8208;resolved manner and investigation of material production or material performance under specific conditions. But how much do we understand Ce L3 XANES? This article provides an overview of the information that can be extracted from experimental Ce L3 XAS/XANES/HERFD data. A collection of XANES data recorded on various cerium systems in HERFD mode is presented here together with detailed discussions on data analysis and the current status of spectral interpretation, including electronic structure calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Porous Synergistic Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous materials including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs) have recently been established as an ideal platform to enhance synergistic photocatalysis for organic transformations. Benefitting from the designability of these molecular materials, both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into the porous carriers, leading to greatly enhanced performance over their homogeneous counterparts.







Abstract
Recent interest has surged in using heterogeneous carriers to boost synergistic photocatalysis for organic transformations. Heterogeneous catalysts not only facilitate synergistic enhancement of distinct catalytic centers compared to their homogeneous counterparts, but also allow for the easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements in developing heterogeneous carriers, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and others, for synergistic catalytic reactions. The advantages of porous materials in heterogeneous catalysis originate from their ability to provide a high surface area, facilitate enhanced mass transport, offer a tunable chemical structure, ensure the stability of active species, and enable easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. Both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into suitable porous carriers to create heterogeneous dual photocatalysts for organic transformations. Notably, experimental evidence from reported cases has shown that the catalytic efficacy of heterogeneous catalysts often surpasses that of their homogeneous analogues. This enhanced performance is attributed to the proximity and confinement effects provided by the porous nature of the carriers. It is expected that porous carriers will provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse catalysts, thus exhibiting superior performance across a range of organic transformations and appealing prospect for industrial applications.

         <title>Chemical Predictive Modelling and Natural Product&#8208;based Divergent Synthesis &#8211; Design of Type B PPAPs with Nanomolar Activities against MRSA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In response to the pressing global challenge of antibiotic resistance, time efficient design and synthesis of novel antibiotics are of immense need. Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAP) were previously reported to effectively combat a range of gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Although the exact mode of action is still not clear, we conceptualized a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach to expand our natural product&#8208;based PPAP library by 30 additional entities to perform SAR studies against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although at this point only data from cellular assays are available and understanding of molecular drug&#8208;target interactions are lacking, the experimental data were used to generate 3D&#8208;QSAR models via an artificial intelligence training and to identify a common pharmacophore model. The experimentally validated QSAR model enabled the estimation of anti&#8208;MRSA activities of a virtual compound library consisting of more than 100.000 in&#8208;silico generated B PPAPs, out of which the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. These novel PPAPs revealed significantly improved cellular activities against MRSA with growth inhibition down to nanomolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium Complexes with Benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic Phosphenium Ligands &#8211; Synthesis, Reactivity and Application in Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability of the NHP&#8208;units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co&#8208;photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H&#8211;H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P&#8208;ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis&#8208;phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P&#8208;shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxide&#8208;Functionalised N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ruthenium Complexes, Experimental and Computational Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand precursors were carried out by direct and mild oxidation from corresponding thioether precursors with high selectivity. A series of cationic [Ru(II)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(NHC&#8208;SO)Cl]+ complexes were obtained in excellent yields by the classical Ag2O transmetallation route. NMR analyses suggested a chelate structure for the metal complexes, and X&#8208;ray diffractometry studies of 4 complexes unambiguously confirmed the preference for the bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;C,S) coordination mode of the NHC&#8208;SO ligands. Interestingly, only one diastereomer, in the form of an enantiomeric pair, was observed both in 1H NMR and in the solid state for the complexes. DFT calculations showed a possible intrinsic energy difference between the two pairs of diastereomers. The calculated energy barriers&#160;suggested that inversion of the sulfoxide is only plausible from the higher energy diastereomer together with bulky substituents. Inverting the configuration at the Ru center instead shows a lower and accessible activation barrier to provide the most stable diastereomer through thermodynamic control, consistent with the observation of a single species by 1H NMR as a pair of enantiomers. All these complexes catalyse the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Aryl Aldehydes Using Propiolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefination of aldehydes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic synthesis. The commonly used Wittig olefination reaction however uses stoichiometric quantities reagents under basic conditions resulting in stoichiometric amounts of byproducts. Known catalytic alternate to the Wittig reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of silane reducing agents and high temperature. Herein, we report a base&#8208;free olefination of aryl aldehydes using propiolates as a surrogate for the Witting reagent under silver catalysis. Trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a silver catalyst adds to the alkynoate to form the nucleophilic silver allenolate which reacts with the reactive oxocarbenium ion formed from aldehyde under the reaction conditions. Subsequently decarbonylation occurs to form the olefin. Trans olefin is formed exclusively from simple aryl aldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Such a silver allenolate is conceptually novel and has not been explored so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis on the Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction of Aminochalcone: Catalytic Performance and Chalcogen Bond Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis, as a new type in the field of non&#8208;covalent bond catalysis, has become a hot research topic in the field of organocatalysis in recent years. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a series of hypervalent ChB catalysis based on the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The reaction includes the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond coupling step (key step) and the proton transfer step. The catalytic performance of mono&#8208;dentate pentafluorophenyl chalcogen bond donor ChB1 was comparable to that of bis&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donor ChB4, and stronger than that of mono&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donors ChB2 and ChB3. The formation of the chalcogen bond between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the reactant, causing the charge rearrangement of the reactant and C(1) charge of the &#8208;C&#8208;Ph group to become more positive, thereby the ChB catalysis promoted the nucleophile reaction. The electron density of the chalcogen bond of the pre&#8208;complex, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8208;N bond coupling process, which provides an idea to predict the catalytic activity of the ChB catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the present study, we report a &#960;&#8208;extended conjugated molecular cleft, two zinc(II)porphyrin bearing bisstyrylBODIPY (dyad, 1) has been synthesized. The binding of 1 via a &#8216;two&#8208;point&#8217; metal&#8208;ligand coordination of a bis&#8208;pyridyl fulleropyrrolidine (2), forming a stable self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex (1:2), has been established. The self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been fully characterized by a suite of physico&#8208;chemical methods, including TD&#8208;DFT studies. From the established energy diagram, both energy and electron transfer events was envisioned. In dyad 1, selective excitation of zinc(II)porphyrin leads to efficient singlet&#8208;singlet excitation transfer to (bisstyrly)BODIPY with an energy transfer rate constant, kEnT of 2.56 x 1012 s&#8208;1. In complex 1:2, photoexcitation of zinc(II)porphyrin results in ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer with a charge separation rate constant, kCS of 2.83 x 1011 s&#8208;1, and a charge recombination rate constant, kCR of 2.51 x 109 s&#8208;1. For excitation at 730 nm corresponding to bisstyrylBODIPY, similar results are obtained, where a biexponential with estimated values of kCS 3.44 x 1011 s&#8208;1 and 2.97 x 1010 s&#8208;1, and a kCR value of 2.10 x 1010 s&#8208;1. The newly built self&#8208;assembled supramolecular complex has been shown to successfully mimic the early events of the photosynthetic antenna&#8208;reaction center events.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported Pt(II) complex encapsulated by intercalated water layers of L4(4)8(8) topology forms intercalato&#8208;clathrate. Its comparison to similar water&#8208;based inclusion compounds allowed to suggest parameters (e.&#8201;g. h&#8208;corrugation height; Nvol&#8208; volumetric corrugation density) characterizing the corrugation of individual layers. Intra&#8208;water energies define particular water systems as confined or confining mediums.







Abstract
Clathrate hydrates are among the most intensively studied H&#8208;bond inclusion compounds. Despite the broad definition for this class of compounds, their meaning commonly refers to closed polyhedral nanocages that encapsulate small guest molecules. On the other hand, larger solutes enforce another type of encapsulation because of the solute size effect. Herein, we report a series of structures containing various molecules encapsulated by intercalated water layers constructed of polycyclic moieties of L4(4)8(8) topology. We parametrized the corrugation of individual layers and characterized interactions governing their formation. We suggested that these could be categorized as two&#8208;dimensional clathrates based on the character of intra&#8208;layer interactions and the effects observed between entrapped molecules and water&#8208;based intercalators.

         <title>Chirality Sensing of Cryptochiral Guests with Prism[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prismarenes function as chiroptical probes for optical chirality sensing. Encapsulation of cryptochiral molecules within the cavity of prismarenes triggers ECD signals. This enables the determination of the absolute configuration of the most stable chiral host&#8208;guest complex. Additionally, the measurement of ECD band intensities facilitates the determination of the enantiomeric ratio of scalemic mixtures.







Abstract
Optical chirality sensing has gained significant attention in recent years. Within this field, the quest for stereodynamic chiroptical probes capable of detecting cryptochiral guests presents a formidable challenge. Macrocycles exhibiting planar chirality have emerged as promising candidates for amplifying the chirality of cryptochiral guests. In this study, we demonstrate that the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes between cryptochiral molecules and planar chiral prismarenes triggers electronic circular dichroism (ECD) signals via host&#8208;guest complexation&#8208;induced chirality amplification. The absolute configuration of the most stable chiral macrocyclic host&#8208;guest complex has been established by resorting to both exciton model and DFT computations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this supramolecular chirality sensing system can be employed to determine the enantiomeric composition of scalemic mixtures by measuring the ECD bands intensity. The information described here opens the way for the use of prismarenes as stereodynamic probes for sensing of cryptochiral guests.

         <title>A Cu/MnOx Composite with Copper&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Oxygen Vacancies as a Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use a simple hydrothermal synthesis method to compound MnOx and Cu. Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are anticipated to be the next generation of important energy storage devices to replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the ongoing use of lithium resources and the safety hazards associated with organic electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Manganese&#8208;based compounds, including MnOx materials, have prominent places among the many zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Additionally, Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Therefore, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.

Therefore, Cu/MnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc-ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Flexibility is a Decisive Factor in FLP Dihydrogen Cleavage with Tetrahedral Lewis Acids: A Silane Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrogen activation is the paradigmatic reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). While trigonal&#8208;planar Lewis acids have been well established in this transformation, tetrahedral Lewis acids are surprisingly limited. Indeed, several cases were computed as thermodynamically and kinetically feasible but exhibit puzzling discrepancies with experimental results. In the present study, a computational investigation of the factors influencing dihydrogen activation are considered by large ensemble sampling of encounter complexes, deformation energies and the activation strain model for a silicon/nitrogen FLP and compared with a boron/phosphorous FLP. The analysis adds the previously missing dimension of Lewis acids&#8217; structural flexibility as a factor that influences preexponential terms beyond pure transition state energies. It sheds light on the origin of &#8220;overfrustration&#8221; (defined herein), indicates structural constraint in Lewis acids as a linchpin for activation of weak donor substrates, and allows drawing a more refined mechanistic picture of this emblematic reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Valorization of Corn Straw for Production of Glucose by Two&#8208;step Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerization of the cellulose part in lignocellulose to glucose is a significant step for lignocellulose valorization. As one of the main by&#8208;products of agricultural biomass in crop&#8208;producing filed, valorization of corn straw has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8208;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis was applied for selective depolymerization of the cellulose component of corn straw to glucose production. Most part of the hemicellulose component could be removed through high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8208;H2O pretreatment in the presence of low concentration of acetic acid, and then as high as 32.2% yield of glucose was achieved in water at 170 oC for 6 h without additional catalyst. The active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation of hydroxymethyl groups to carboxyl groups on glucose units of cellulose was shown to be crucial for the efficient valorization of corn straw for glucose production.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Conformation Controls Assembly of a Helicate/Mesocate, Heteroleptic [Pd2L2L&#8217;2] Cages and a Six&#8208;Jagged [Pd6L12] Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular building blocks, capable of adopting several strongly deviating conformations, are of particular interest in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assemblies. The pronounced structural flexibility of a short acridone&#8208;based bridging ligand, equipped with two monodentate isoquinoline donors, is herein exploited to assemble a surprisingly diverse series of coordination&#8208;driven Pd(II) architectures. First, it can form a highly twisted Pd2L4 helicate,&#160;transformable into the corresponding mesocate, controlled by temperature, counter anion and choice of solvent. Second, it also allows the formation of heteroleptic cages, either from a mix of ligands with Pd(II) cations or by cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation from homoleptic assemblies. Here, the acridone&#8208;based ligand tolerates counter ligands that carry their donors either in a diverging or converging arrangement, as it can rotate its own coordination sites by 90&#176; and structurally adapt to both situations via shape complementarity. Third, by a near 180&#176; rotation of only one of its arms, the ligand can adopt an S&#8208;shape conformation and form an unprecedented C6h&#8208;symmetric Pd6L12 saw&#8208;toothed six&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>
