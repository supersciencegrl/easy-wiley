         <title>Preparation of Hierarchically Porous Monolithic Corn Straw@COF Composite for Fat&#8208;rich Food Pretreatment in Non&#8208;targeted Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the food safety non&#8208;targeted analysis, it is urgent to develop suitable adsorbent materials for sample pretreatment, so as to achieve efficient removal of interference matrices in food samples and &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of potential chemical hazards. Traditional adsorption materials exhibit limitations such as poor removal efficiency and high cost. To address these issues, this study presents the preparation of a hierarchically porous monolithic corn straw@COF (CS@COF) composite for efficient sample pretreatment of fat&#8208;rich foods. CS@COF combines the advantages of corn straw (CS) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), offering a high specific surface area and porosity. CS serves as a carrier for in&#8208;situ growth of COF, resulting in a material with easy operation and low cost. CS@COF demonstrates strong adsorption capacity, effectively removing over 98% of triglycerides within 8 minutes from fat&#8208;rich food samples like soybean. Moreover, it achieves "full recovery" of 190 chemical hazards with 89% recoveries within the ideal range. The reusability of CS@COF for 5 cycles after elution further underscores its practicality. This innovative CS@COF composite shows great potential in sample pretreatment for non&#8208;targeted food safety analysis, providing a cost&#8208;effective and efficient solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathepsin L Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Resistant Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise identification of drug&#8208;resistant tumor cells remains a critical challenge for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Herein, we present FR&#8208;DCO, a cathepsin L (CTSL)&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe, engineered for targeted imaging of doxorubicin&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells (MCF&#8208;7/ADR). Capitalizing on the overexpression of CTSL in chemoresistant malignancies, FR&#8208;DCO integrates a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (Phe&#8208;Arg, FR) with a dicyanoisophorone (DCO) fluorophore, enabling fluorescence activation via a single&#8208;step enzymatic cleavage. Upon hydrolysis, FR&#8208;DCO transitions from an intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;quenched state to an activated DCO fluorophore, achieving a 12.8&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield. In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis in MCF&#8208;7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensity than its non&#8208;resistant counterparts (MCF&#8208;7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug&#8208;resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of non&#8208;resistant lesions within 20 min post&#8208;injection. Notably, dual&#8208;tumor xenograft models confirmed precise discrimination of MCF&#8208;7/ADR tumors from 4T1 tumors, highlighting the spatial resolution of the probe. This work not only provides a molecular tool for spatiotemporal resistance monitoring, but also establishes a modular design paradigm for enzyme&#8208;responsive probes targeting tumor microenvironment biomarkers, advancing precision oncology strategies.</dc:description>

In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in MCF-7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3-fold higher fluorescence intensity than its non-resistant counterparts (MCF-7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug-resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of non-resistant lesions within 20 min post-injection.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Crystal Actuation of Fluorinated Acylhydrazones Enabled by [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline materials with photomechanical responsiveness have garnered significant attention in flexible actuators and micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems due to their unique capability to directly convert light into mechanical energy. In this work, four novel fluorinated acylhydrazone compounds were successfully synthesized through direct condensation reactions between 4,4&#8217;&#8208;difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and acylhydrazine compounds, including benzoylhydrazine (BHD), 3&#8208;fluorobenzoylhydrazine (3&#8208;FBHD), isoniazid (IND), and acetylhydrazine (AED). Systematic investigation of their photomechanical responses revealed distinct molecular mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD, DFBP&#8208;IND) exhibit dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365 nm UV irradiation, whereas the hydrazone derivative DFBP&#8208;AED remains inert. This confirms the essential role of [2+2] photocycloaddition&#8208;dependent C=N double bonds in photomechanical activity. Comprehensive characterization through DSC, TG, XRD, 1H/13C NMR, and HRMS elucidated the formation pathways and structural characteristics of photocycloaddition products. Density functional theory calculations revealed that energy disparities between (0 0 1) and (1 0 0) crystallographic planes govern longitudinal fragmentation patterns. This study establishes a &#8220;molecular structure&#8208;crystal arrangement&#8208;macroscopic response&#8221; multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy, offering novel insights for developing high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven materials.</dc:description>

In this work, four novel fluorinated acylhydrazone compounds were successfully synthesized through direct condensation reactions between 4,4&#8217;-difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and acylhydrazine compounds, including benzoylhydrazine (BHD), 3-fluorobenzoylhydrazine (3-FBHD), isoniazid (IND), and acetylhydrazine (AED). Systematic investigation of their photomechanical responses revealed distinct molecular mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP-BHD, DFBP-3-FBHD, DFBP-IND) exhibit dynamic photo-responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365 nm UV irradiation, whereas the hydrazone derivative DFBP-AED remains inert.

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning of Physicochemical Properties of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes Introducing Fluorine Atom(s) on the Building Blocks Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated oxetane derivatives garner significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse bioisosteric possibilities for potential applications in medicinal chemistry. We developed robust methodologies for the synthesis of 3&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted oxetanes, leveraging nucleophilic substitution, deoxy&#8208; and deoxofluorination, as well as fluoroiodination as key steps of introduction of fluorine atoms directly to the oxetane core or adjacent alkyl groups. Optimized reaction sequences enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various small building blocks, i.e. amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc. Physicochemical studies revealed that fluorination significantly impacts acidity, with oxetane derivatives demonstrating the decrease of pKa values on up to three units in the case of replacement of gem&#8208;dimethyl, cyclopropyl&#8208; or cyclobutylidene moieties. These findings underscore the utility of fluorinated oxetanes as versatile building blocks for future applications in drug design and advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Mechanistic Insights into Transition Metal&#8208;Based Spin&#8208;Modulated Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harnessing secondary energy sources for water electrolysis to generate &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is instrumental in constructing a zero&#8208;carbon&#8208;emission hydrogen value chain. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a bottleneck due to its complex four&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Investigation of high&#8208;performance anodic OER catalysts has been developed into a hot research field. The high kinetic barrier associated with OER is strongly linked to the interplay between singlet state of OH&#8722;/H2O and triplet state of O2, this interconversion process is significantly influenced by the spin states of metal centers in catalysts. In this short review, the fundamental mechanisms of spin effects in oxygen evolution are briefly discussed with respect to the thermodynamics, active species formation, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, the recent approaches to modulate spin configuration of electrocatalysts are summarized, such as lattice substitution, defect engineering, interface regulation, ligand adsorption, and size modulation. In last section, the challenges and perspectives for future development of spin&#8208;related catalysis are discussed, aiming to provide insights into spin effects in water oxidation and guidance for designing efficient OER catalysts.</dc:description>

Substitution of PPh3 in 1 with PPh2Me gives trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh2Me)] (3) in toluene at 105 &#176;C. The cationic complexes cis&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(dppb)]OAc (4) and [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)(SNS)(PPh3)]OAc (5) are synthetized from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(dppb)] and [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(CO)(PPh3)2], respectively, by treatment with the SNS ligand in toluene. Hydride trans&#8208;[RuH(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(PPh3)] (6) is obtained by reaction of 1 with NaOiPr in iPrOH/toluene. The carboxylate complexes 1&#8208;6 catalyze the homogeneous hydrogenation of methyl decanoate to 1&#8208;decanol with NaOMe under mild reaction conditions (T = 40 &#176;C, H2 pressure 27.5 bar) and extremely low catalyst loading (S/C 10000&#8208;100000). Complexes 1 and 2 display remarkably high catalytic activity for the reduction of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters at S/C of 50000&#8208;100000, with high selectivity for the reduction of the carboxylate group in the presence of C=C functionalities. An easy scale&#8208;up of this process (100 mmol of substrate) has been demonstrated. Mechanistic studies show that 1 reacts with H2 (5 bar), affording the monohydride 6 that by further reaction with H2 and an alkoxide gives the dihydride cis&#8208;[RuH2(SNS)(PPh3)], which reduces methyl benzoate to benzyl alcohol.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized in Triplicate: A Ring&#8208;by&#8208;Ring Approach to Tailored Prodiginine Derivatives for Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Through Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tripyrrole alkaloid prodigiosin and related members of this family are structurally diverse bacterial secondary metabolites. The privileged scaffold accounts for versatile biological activities, e.g., antimicrobial, antitumoral, and immunosuppressive. Its Lewis&#8208;basic lipophilic tripyrrole core and the aliphatic side chains allow for passive membrane diffusion, thereby trespassing the natural permeability barrier. However, diffusion&#8208;controlled uptake is accompanied by low target specificity, hampering the development of tailored prodigiosin therapeutics and their selective delivery to target sites. To address this downside, this work focuses on providing the chemical methodology to synthesize prodiginines that are amenable to click chemistry on each of the three pyrrole moieties and facilitate the development of prodigiosin conjugates. Installing reactive organic azides and maleimides in the A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and C&#8208;ring of the cytotoxic scaffold enables their further functionalization per azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC and SPAAC) and thiol&#8208;maleimide addition, giving rise to protein&#8208;conjugable prodiginines for the first time. The presented synthetic routes comprise yields of 3.2&#8722;4.7% over 12&#8722;15 synthetic steps and grant access to valuable synthetic elements for expanding the toolbox of click chemistry to other pyrrole&#8208;, pyrrolidinone&#8208;, and tetramic acid&#8208;containing natural products. The devised methodology for prodiginine derivatization will collectively advance the development of alkaloid&#8208;based conjugate therapeutics, eligible for target&#8208;selective delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Sodium&#8208;Ion Conducting Sulfonated Polytriazole and Composite Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The table of contents illustrates the structural engineering of the polymer electrolytes, which results in a self&#8208;assembled, phase&#8208;separated morphology. This morphology resulted&#160;in enhanced solvent absorption and wettability, which in turn leads to improved ionic conductivity that is suitable for alkali metal battery applications.








Abstract
The ongoing energy crisis and the increasing demand for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have raised concerns about the availability and affordability of lithium. In light of their abundance and lower production costs, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have the potential to replace LMBs. However, due to the reactivity of organic electrolytes with the sodium anode, it is essential to design safer electrolytes to prevent short&#8208;circuiting. This study focuses on the design and evaluation of fillers and single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs), including sodium salt of sulfonated graphene oxide (Na&#8208;SGO), sulfonated polytriazole (PTSICPE&#8208;90), and various blend composites, which outperform Celgard 2400 in terms of thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. The Na&#8208;SGO filler demonstrated a desirable Na&#8208;ion conductivity of 11.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 Scm&#8722;1 at 90 &#176;C in a solvated state. Due to the high solvent absorption (70&#160;wt.%), good wettability (22.2&#176;), and significant porosity (58%) of the SICPEs, notable Na&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (nonsolvated at 30 &#176;C) and 1.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (solvated at 40 &#176;C) were observed. These properties make them an appealing choice for electrolytic applications in SMBs.

         <title>Bis(phenylsulfonyl)Methane (BPSM) as Multifunctional Electrolyte Additive Constructing a Stable Interfaces for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Graphite Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) as an electrolyte additive enhances the performance of NCM811/graphite batteries. BPSM facilitates the formation of a more stable interfacial film on the electrode surface. The available data demonstrate that the capacity retention of the battery at low temperature is significantly improved. BPSM showcases potential as an influential additive for NCM811/graphite batteries under the condition of low temperature.








Abstract
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) is used as a functional electrolyte additive to assist in the construction of stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial films to improve the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite batteries at room and low temperatures and compared to the non&#8208;BPSM&#8208;containing batteries, rate and cycling performance of BPSM&#8208;containing batteries can also be enhanced. After 1200 cycles at 25 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 8.68% to 83.07%. After 130 cycles at &#8722;10 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 21.01% to 98.97%. The spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that BPSM is preferentially oxidized and reduced on the cathode and anode, respectively, to construct stable and high&#8208;conductivity electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The enhanced performance reveals that BPSM is an effective film&#8208;forming additive with promising applications in nickel&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
Achieving both enhanced strength and improved toughness of polypropylene (PP) remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. The present study addresses this limitation by constructing a robust crystalline network through the strategic integration of hyperbranched topology. We demonstrate that a hyperbranched nucleating agent (HBPN) effectively induces high&#8208;content &#946;&#8208;crystal formation in PP, which organizes into an interconnected crystalline architecture. This &#946;&#8208;phase network significantly enhances the mechanical performance of PP, with tensile strength and notched impact strength increasing by 35.78% (to 42.5&#160;MPa) and 140% (to 13.2 KJ/m2), respectively, compared to pure PP. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergy between strength and toughness originates from HBPN mediated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization, which refines the morphology of spherulites and increases the degree of crystallinity. The hyperbranched topology of HBPN inhibits entangled PP chains and facilitates crystallization of PP chains. Thus, it contributes to efficient stress redistribution by dissipating localized energy through multidirectional load transfer, while arresting crack advancement via microvoid&#8208;induced stress relaxation. This work demonstrates an effective conceptual approach to engineering high&#8208;performance PP, unlocking its potential for various value&#8208;added applications.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Metalated Ge9 Zintl Clusters as Single&#8208;Site Homogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni0 atom is fixed into a nine atomic germanium cluster core and remains active in the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene. This clearly confirms the idea to use Zintl cluster as support material for catalytically active transition metals.








Abstract
Homogeneous catalytic reactions performed without or with highly abundant transition metals is an increasing field of research due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability. Therefore, using main group element Zintl cluster as support material for transition metals via synthesizing single site homogeneous catalysts (SSHoC) could be a way to make such metals feasible for catalysis, without the risk of metal loss or agglomeration like in classical single site catalysts. A synthetic protocol for four cluster compounds K[Hyp3Ge9Ni(PR3)] (Hyp&#160;=&#160;Si{SiMe3}3; R&#160;=&#160;Ph, ptolyl, iPr, Me, 1&#8211;4) is presented, in which the nickel atom is embedded into the cluster core. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI/MS as well as for 1 and 3 by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination comprising a closo&#8208;[Ge9Ni] core. The cleavage of the triphenylphosphine ligand in 1 in THF, with and without 2.2.2&#8208;crypt, and acetonitrile as well as the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene in the same solvents have been investigated via NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Fe3+ Oxidation Strategy Enhances the Nonradiative Transition Ability of a Near&#8208;Infrared BODIPY Photosensitizer for Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing near&#8208;infrared photothermal reagents with intramolecular charge transfer properties using high&#8208;priced metal oxides, effective killing of tumor cells was achieved.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizer NIR&#8208;2BDP is constructed through an Fe3+ oxidation strategy. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that intramolecular charge separation effectively reduces the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, broadens the light absorption range, and suppresses radiative transition (RT) processes. The decrease in the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of NIR&#8208;2BDP (the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (S1&#8594;T1) is 2.5 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP, and the singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield is 2.1 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP). The low RT (only 2.2% fluorescence quantum yield) and relatively low triplet generation (11.7% 1O2 quantum yield) suggest that NIR&#8208;2BDP should have a stronger contribution of nonradiative transition (NRT) processes (and hence a higher photothermal conversion capability). Nanoparticles constructed from NIR&#8208;2BDP and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 exhibit good photothermal conversion efficiency (41.4%) and killing efficiency to tumor cells in the NIR&#8208;II window (1000&#8208;1700&#160;nm). Therefore, this study extends the sensitization window and improves the NRT ability, paving the way for the construction of multi&#8208;functional NIR BODIPY&#8208;like photosensitizers.

         <title>New Click on the Block: Photocaged Hydroxylamine, an Addition to the Light&#8208;Activatable Bioorthogonal Toolbox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retro&#8208;Cope bioorthogonal reactivity of hydroxylamines was disabled transiently with a coumarin photolabile protecting group, which could be recovered upon removal of the protecting group by a short, 400 nm light illumination. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated in bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling schemes of intracellular proteins in live cells.








Abstract
A new photoactivatable bioorthogonal function was added to the photoactivatable bioorthogonal toolbox by transiently disabling the bioorthogonal reactivity of the hydroxylamine moiety with a photolabile protecting group. The photocaged bioorthogonal function was further equipped with a HaloTag substrate to enable its use in live&#8208;cell labeling schemes. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated by bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling of intracellular proteins in live cells.

         <title>Constructing Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Systems with High&#8208;Contrast Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Through a Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient phosphorescent systems are constructed by doping weakly emissive hosts and guests. The doping systems exhibit high&#8208;contrast multi&#8208;stimuli response in both fluorescence and phosphorescence, which is rarely reported.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted significant attention because of their potential applications in information storage, bioimaging, sensors, among others. However, the design of high&#8208;performance stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP materials remains challenging. In this work, multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP systems are constructed by utilizing the acid&#8208;base responsive properties of the pyridine group, the heavy&#8208;atom effect of halogen and sulfur atoms, and d&#8208;p&#960; bonds. Six phenothiazine derivatives are designed and synthesized. A systematic investigation is conducted on the effects of molecular structure, molecular conformation, stacking arrangements, and intermolecular interactions on their luminescence properties. Employing phenothiazine derivatives as the guest and their corresponding 5,5&#8208;dioxide phenothiazine derivatives as the host, host&#8208;guest doping is achieved through the slow solvent evaporation and the melting&#8208;blending methods. The host&#8208;guest doping system exhibits highly efficient and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence through the formation of triplet exciplexes, with a phosphorescence quantum yield of up to 63.6%. The doping systems exhibit higher&#8208;contrast acid&#8208;base, acid&#8208;thermal, and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive luminescence characteristics than the single compounds. The potential applications of these systems in sensors, multicolor patterning, and multi&#8208;information encryption are explored.

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active H6HHTP ligand is isolated in two redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand allows accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes, increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system.








Abstract
A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8722;/cat2&#8722; couples of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition versus Migratory Insertion Pathways in the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Heck Reaction: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction&#8221; could in principle proceed either via nucleophilic attack by triflate, or by migratory alkene insertion. This DFT study shows that nucleophilic attack is strongly preferred but ligand dependent.








Abstract
The initial reaction steps in the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalyzed by P^N chelated Au(III) complexes have been studied computationally. Two mechanistic alternatives have been explored: (1) alkene coordination and insertion into a gold&#8208;carbon bond, and (2) nucleophilic attack on a gold(III) alkene adduct. The common starting point, the [(P^N)AuPh(alkene)]2+ dication (alkene&#160;=&#160;C2H4, H2C&#9552;CHEt, or H2C&#9552;CEt2), shows unequal bonding to the olefinic carbons of the 1&#8208;alkenes (P^N&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;C6H4NMe2(PR2); R&#160;=&#160;H, Me, 1&#8208;adamantyl). This polarization increases with steric hindrance and with the inclusion of an OTf&#8208; anion in the model. While the reaction pathways are strongly governed by the trans&#8208;influence of the ligand, the effects of steric hindrance in the ligand and alkene are remarkably small. In all cases the nucleophilic attack pathway is energetically favored. However, changing the ligand from a P^N to a P^P chelate, with a strongly electron&#8208;donating &#8208;PMe2 donor trans to Ph, sufficiently destabilizes the Au&#9472;Ph bond to make alkene insertion competitive. Alkene 1,2&#8208;insertion regiochemistry is always preferred, unlike Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction that requires a 2,1&#8208;insertion. Based on these results, an alkene insertion pathway en route to Heck&#8208;type olefins can therefore be ruled out.

         <title>Ca2+ Stabilized by Carborate Anions: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium salts consisting of Ca2+ weakly coordinated by carborate counterions have been prepared through anhydrous and aqueous methods. The Ca2+ center is sufficiently Lewis acidic to weakly coordinate olefins, alkynes and aromatics, and catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes.








Abstract
The syntheses of calcium carborates, Ca[HexCB11Cl11]2, 1, Ca[HCB11Cl11]2, 2, and Ca[MeCB11Cl11]2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), 3&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), (o&#8208;DFB&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene) including the structure of 2&#183;4(o&#8208;DFB) are described. The large size of the Ca2+ cation is reflected by the coordination geometry with the Ca center being coordinated by three Cl donors from each of the carborate anions and one F donor from each of the two coordinated solvent molecules. Based on 11B NMR and DOSY NMR studies, the salts 1, 2 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) form close ion pairs in PhBr and o&#8208;DFB solutions. The Fluoride Ion Affinities (FIA) in PhBr for the salts 1 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) were DFT&#8208;calculated (&#969;B97XD/6&#8211;31&#160;+&#160;G**) at 211.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 and 217.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, which is below that of the landmark Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (241.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). The Ca2+ center in salt 1 is sufficiently Lewis acidic to coordinate 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (1,5&#8208;COD) and 2,6&#8208;octadiyne and to catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes, albeit slowly. Compound 1 also displays moderate activity as a catalyst for transfer hydrogenation catalysis and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (COM), a first for Ca compounds.

A double click&#8208;strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8208;Alder reactions involving a reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained diene is reported. Three different one&#8208;pot protocols (i.e., sequential or three&#8208;component reactions) are proposed and offer valuable guidance for future applications. The reactions are performed under mild conditions (37 &#176;C in H2O/iPrOH for 1&#8208;2&#160;hours) and can afford the desired bioconjugates in good overall isolated yields. Successfully applied on small peptides, the method demonstrates its efficiency and interest toward applications in chemical biology.








Abstract
We report an efficient double&#8208;click strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions, enabled by newly designed heterobifunctional platforms bearing orthogonal clickable groups: alkyne&#8211;dithioester, alkyne&#8211;maleimide, or azide&#8211;diene. These platforms were evaluated through both one&#8208;pot sequential protocols (CuAAC/DA or CuAAC/thia&#8208;DA) and three&#8208;component reactions (3CR), using model substrates with complementary functionalities. The use of a highly reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained exocyclic diene, enabled rapid cycloadditions with maleimide or phosphonodithioester dienophiles. All reactions were performed under mild, biocompatible conditions (37&#160;&#176;C, 1:1 H&#8322;O/iPrOH, 1&#8211;2&#160;hours), and most afforded the desired conjugates in good isolated yields. The methodology was further validated through the successful bioconjugation of three small peptides with either a fluorophore or biotin, demonstrating its efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with biologically relevant functional groups.

         <title>Supramolecular Polyelectrolyte Film for Spontaneous Electricity Generation With Photoresponsive Output Signals and Intrinsic Recyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an alternative new type of spontaneous moisture electricity generator, a recyclable polyelectrolyte film was developed by the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of LA and polyelectrolyte HA, with an azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid. This film can absorb ambient moisture and induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow, thereby enabling electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals.








Abstract
Developing recyclable polymeric films for spontaneous power generation with stimuli&#8208;responsive output signals is a significant step toward sustainable wearable sensors, fashion textiles, etc., which remains highly challenging. Herein, we developed polyelectrolyte films for moisture&#8208;sorption&#8208;based electricity generation with photoresponsive electrical output signals from supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of lipoic acid (LA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with amphiphilic azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid via an evaporation&#8208;induced polymerization process. Due to the intrinsic hygroscopic property and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structure with water channels, the corresponding polyelectrolyte films can absorb ambient moisture to induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow in the water channels, enabling spontaneous electricity generation. The polyelectrolyte film (0.4&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;1.5&#160;cm) generated currents up to 11.8 nA at ambient conditions (21.6&#176;C and 69% RH). Notably, an immediate increase of current signal was observed by exposure to UV light because of variations in molecular geometry and polarity of the azobenzene dopant between trans and cis isomers. Besides, the polyelectrolyte films were easily recycled by dissolving in water and subsequent re&#8208;evaporation. The results demonstrated a new and simple pathway for developing recyclable supramolecular materials featuring spontaneous electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals, providing attractive opportunities for future sustainable advanced materials.

         <title>A Supramolecular System of Bioactive Ionic Liquid, Peony Extract, and Peptide for Enhanced Permeability and Synergistic Skincare Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a sustainable supramolecular system composed of naturally derived ingredients: PE, AHP8, and a bioactive ionic liquid from betaine and MA, which offers multiple anti&#8208;aging benefits while promoting skin permeability.








Abstract
The growing demand for safe and sustainable cosmetics has led to a marked inclination toward natural extracts and peptides as raw materials. In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple antiaging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide&#8208;8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid (MA) ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration, but also exerts synergistic anti&#8208;aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti&#8208;wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.

         <title>Highly Stable Sp2 Conjugated Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastable redox&#8208;acitve PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF has been synthesized for sustainable energy storage, with more than 100% capacitance retention even after 5000 charging/discharging cycles during the electrochemical process.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with reversible redox&#8208;active units are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. The highly extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated redox&#8208;active PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF is synthesized via Schiff&#8208;base condensation between p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPDA) and 2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;(p&#8208;formylphenoxy)1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) monomers. The ample redox active sites of PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF enabled exceptional energy storage, achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 250 F g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 34.72&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 current density. The material demonstrated extraordinary cycling stability, retaining over 100% capacitance after 5000 cycles at 7 A g&#8722;1 current density. This superior performance is attributed to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, abundant redox&#8208;active centers, and an efficient charge transport pathway, making it an ideal supercapacitor electrode material. The presence of diamine moieties enhanced conductivity, while redox&#8208;active imine sites facilitated hydrogen ion storage. Electrochemical investigations under acidic conditions revealed significant perturbations in the electronic structure, elucidating the redox charge storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation in HOMO and LUMO orbitals, providing key insights into charge mobility. This study presents a novel strategy for designing redox&#8208;active COFs for high&#8208;performance pseudocapacitive energy storage.

         <title>The Ascent of Supramolecular Polymers and Gels in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SPs and gels emerged as modular platforms for asymmetric catalysis. This review ranks literature reports according to the achiral or chiral nature of the monomers bearing the catalytic site. New paradigms showcased by this approach are particularly highlighted, such as catalysts operating with a low amount of chiral inducers, or with no chiral inducer, and the development of switchable asymmetric catalysts.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) and gels, formed by the spontaneous assembly of small molecules through various types of noncovalent interactions, are attractive materials for many applications. Their modularity also offers many opportunities in asymmetric catalysis that have been tackled in the last two decades and more intensively in the last one. In this review, strategies adopted to develop efficient asymmetric catalysts supported on SPs and gels are first categorized according to the chiral or achiral nature of the monomers used for their construction and second to their ability to be commuted into different states. Catalytic SPs have been described for which enantioselectivity stems mostly from the molecular chirality located next to the reactive group, or at opposite ends of the spectrum, exclusively from the chiral environment provided by the supramolecular helices. New paradigms revealed by these systems include (i) the organization of catalytic sites at the periphery of modular and well&#8208;structured 1D assemblies, (ii) the possibility to conduct asymmetric reactions with a sub&#8208;catalytic amount of chiral inducers and even in the absence of chiral monomers, and (iii) the development of a new class of switchable asymmetric catalysts.

         <title>Perspectives of Soft Lattice Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts, Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;activity relationship between the microstructure of MHPs and various photocatalytic properties was prospected, including excited state structural distortion, energy level rearrangement, and ion doping.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in lead&#8208;free perovskite materials (LFPMs). By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Advances in Copper and Nickel C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O Cross&#8208;Couplings of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ancillary Ligand Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important recent advances in ancillary ligand design that enable superlative copper or nickel catalyst systems for C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of inexpensive and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple thermal conditions are discussed.








Abstract
The evolution of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling chemistry into first&#8208;choice methods for the synthesis of aniline and phenol derivatives can be attributed to innovations in ancillary ligand design that facilitate challenging elementary steps of thermal catalysis. Inspired by this strategy, and in the quest to establish more sustainable thermal base metal catalysis that is competitive with and complementary to such precious metal protocols, several successful mechanism&#8208;inspired ancillary ligand classes for use in enabling high&#8208;performing copper and nickel catalysts have emerged over the last decade. In this Review we document key ancillary ligand advances of this type, with a focus on superlative copper and nickel catalysts that enable C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of cheap and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple conditions of relevance to end&#8208;users in academia and industry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Chlorination and Bromination of Pyrazolopyridines and Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report electrophilic ring&#8208;opening halogenation of pyrazolopyridines and isoxazoles. Selective cleavage of C&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds enables the synthesis of tertiary chlorinated and brominated compounds under mild conditions.








Abstract
We report the development of electrophilic ring&#8208;opening chlorination and bromination reactions of pyrazoloazines and isoxazoles using chlorinating and brominating agents. These transformations proceed via selective cleavage of heteroaromatic N&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds, delivering structurally diverse tertiary halogenated compounds. Furthermore, treatment of formylated pyrazolopyridines with two equivalents of chlorinating or brominating agents afforded dihalogenated products in good yields. This strategy represents a valuable platform for constructing halogenated scaffolds from simple heteroaromatic precursors and broadens the synthetic utility of skeletal transformations in the functionalization of heteroaromatics.

Abstract
[{Cp'Fe(&#956;&#8208;I)}2] (I; Cp&#8217; = &#951;5&#8211;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2) reacts with [Na(OCP)(1,4&#8208;dioxane)x] and K(OCAs) to yield [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;P2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (1) and [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;As2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (3), respectively. While complex 1 was previously accessed by Scherer and co&#8208;workers using rather harsh reaction conditions, the new synthetic method already proceeds at ambient temperature. UV&#8208;light irradiation of 1 and 3 induces CO release forming complexes [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E2)] (E&#160;=&#160;P (2) and As (4)), respectively. However, both reactions also yielded several byproducts which were spectroscopically identified. Furthermore, upon thermally triggered CO elimination from 3 the Fe3As6&#8208;cluster [(Cp'Fe)3(As3)2] (5) is isolated in low yield. In addition, zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra were recorded on complexes 1&#8211;4 and computational studies complement the experimental findings and provide additional insights into the bonding in these complexes and the reaction pathways resulting in the formation of complexes 1&#8211;4.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and in Vitro Selection of De Novo Thiazole&#8208;Containing Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone Thz moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions.

This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand development in pseudo&#8208;natural peptide discovery.








Abstract
Backbone thiazole (Thz) moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. However, the de novo discovery of artificial Thz&#8208;containing peptide ligands remains challenging. Here, we report an mRNA display&#8208;based selection platform for Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides (ThzteMP), established through a dedicated posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This method exploits the unique reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, enabling enzyme&#8208;free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline (Thn), which is further oxidized using the substrate&#8208;tolerant azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a Thz moiety. By integrating this chemoenzymatic process with chloroacetyl&#8208;mediated thioether macrocyclization and mRNA display, we have successfully discovered Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide ligands with high binding affinities against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 (PAK4). This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand discovery of pseudo&#8208;natural peptides and to investigate the functional benefit of their backbone Thzs.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Bimetallic Cu(II) Compounds as Potent Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agents with Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Lactamase Inhibitory Activity Against Multidrug Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with MBL inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated MDR gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1. The as&#8208;synthesized Cu(II) compounds exhibited significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex vivo applicability studies. These compounds also blocked the activity of MBLs via strong interactions with the active sites of enzymes, thus restoring the normal activity of the antibiotics.








Abstract
In this research, a novel class of biologically active bimetallic Cu(II) compounds has been discovered as cutting&#8208;edge antibiofilm agents with metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibitory activity against the clinically isolated multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) gram&#8208;negative bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1). As the traditional strategies for antibiotic development are proving inadequate against the swift evolution of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need to establish novel antibacterial strategies with mechanism different from those of prevailing antibiotics. Thus, the 2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;{N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridylmethyl)amine}methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol (H3L)&#8208;incorporated three bimetallic Cu(II) compounds, [Cu2L(H2O)(Cl)]&#183;H2O (1), [Cu2L(H2O)(NO3)]&#183;H2O (2) and [Cu2L(H2O)(CH3CO2)]&#183;H2O (3) has been strategically designed and synthesized with an unsymmetrical coordination arrangement that synergistically modifies the electronic environment of Cu centers for the enhancement of antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. The electronic environment of Cu(II) and its adjoining atoms has been further modified by substituting Cl&#8722; in 1 by NO3&#8722; in 2 and CH3CO2&#8722; in 3. The standard nitrocefin assay disclosed that 1&#8211;3 significantly inhibited the activity of MBLs produced by Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1 at the half minimum inhibitory concentration (1/2 MIC). Molecular docking study suggested an excellent propensity of these Cu compounds for binding with MBL&#8208;producing proteins such as Verona integron&#8208;encoded metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (VIM&#8208;1), Sao Paulo metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (SPM&#8208;1), imipenemase (IMP&#8208;1), AmpC, and New Delhi metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (NDM&#8208;1). However, the best possible interaction was observed for VIM&#8208;1 protein. All three Cu(II) compounds displayed significantly high antibacterial and antibiofilm activity as established by multiple bioassays, including ex vivo applicability studies. However, 1 and 3 showed an outstanding activity with MIC values of 200 and 150 &#181;g/mL, respectively, in comparison to 2 with an MIC of 300 &#181;g/mL. They showed an exceptional combinatorial activity when examined with five different commercially accessible &#946;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based antibiotics, such as amoxicillin (AMX), chloramphenicol (CHL), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CTR), and cefoxitin (CX) against Pa&#8208;CI&#8208;1. It has been suggested that the as&#8208;synthesized Cu compounds also blocked the activity of MBLs via strong interactions with the active sites of enzymes, thus restoring the normal activity of the antibiotics. Our study disclosed that 1&#8211;3 could be the emergent drug leads and attract great attention to the materials and biological chemists, combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

         <title>Hydrophobic and Polarized Aromatic Residues Promote Internalization of Arg&#8208;Rich Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides through Ionpair&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>

By introducing analogues of Trp in Ar/Trp cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, we investigated the role of this unique amino acid in the cell uptake and interaction with cell membrane partners using experimental and computational approaches.








Abstract
Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are small sequences that can cross cell membranes. Arg and Trp are highly prevalent amino acids in natural and synthetic efficient CPP sequences. In particular, Trp is essential and cannot be substituted by other hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids. The aim of the present study is to decipher the role of Trp in synthetic Arg/Trp CPP sequences. To do so, a small peptide library in which this residue was substituted by other natural or nonnatural amino acids was designed. Internalization of these peptides in cells was evaluated, and it appeared that combining aromaticity and hydrophobicity in the presence of Arg residues leads to enhanced internalization. The study of the interaction of these peptides with model lipid membranes revealed that the modulation of hydrophobicity promoted insertion in bilayers but had little impact on the binding affinity. On the other hand, more hydrophobic substitutes of Trp led to more favorable binding enthalpies to heparin. With density functional theory (DFT) analysis, we suggest that ion&#8208;pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the aromatic ring and the ion pair formed by the positively charged Arg and the negatively charged cell surface groups can be established and could be at the origin of the unique internalization properties of Trp&#8208;containing Arg&#8208;rich CPPs.

         <title>An Anionic Vanadium Thionitrosyl Complex Supported by an Anilide&#8208;Bis(aryloxide) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic vanadium thionitrosyl complex was prepared by reaction of a vanadium nitrido complex with elemental sulfur. The thionitrosyl complex can be formally described as a vanadium(V) complex coordinated by a [NS]3&#8722; ligand, with a significant contribution from a thio&#8208;imido resonance form. The thionitrosyl complex was shown to react with a variety of substrates at the thionitrosyl sulfur atom and across the V&#8211;N bond.








Abstract
Reaction of [{K(dme)}{(ONO)V&#8801;N}]2 ([ONO]3&#8722; = anilide&#8208;bis(aryloxide)) with elemental sulfur afforded an anionic thionitrosyl complex [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NS)], which could be isolated as a dark red solid. The solid&#8208;state metrical parameters suggest that it is best described with a thio&#8208;imido resonance form. The thionitrosyl complex was shown to react with a variety of substrates at the thionitrosyl sulfur atom and across the V&#8211;N bond. Reaction with PPh3 occurred with sulfur atom transfer to form the nitride and SPPh3. The thionitrosyl complex underwent S&#8208;alkylation with alkyl halides to form a sulfenylimido complex [(ONO)V(NSR)] (R&#160;=&#160;Me, CH2C6H4&#8208;4&#8208;Me). Reactions with Me3SiCl and BPh3 resulted in the formation of [(ONO)V(NSiMe3)] and [K(dme)4][(ONO)V(NBPh3)] along with concomitant loss of sulfur. When treated with CO2, CS2, and PhNCS, the reactions took place across the V&#8211;N bond to generate [(ONO)VE] (E&#160;=&#160;O, S). The thionitrosyl complex was unstable in toluene and underwent dimerization via loss of K2S to afford [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSN)]. Reaction of the thionitrosyl complex with [Cp2Fe][PF6] gave a mixture of products containing the NSN complex and [{(ONO)V}2(&#956;&#8208;NSSN)].

         <title>Diethenyl Sulfoximine (DESI) as an Irreversible Lysine&#8208;Targeting Warhead Enables the Design of Covalent Allosteric EGFR Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DESI is a novel lysine covalent warhead with moderate reactivity and hydrolytic stability, which can form a stable six&#8208;membered cyclic adduct with lysine. DESI&#8208;derived EGFR allosteric inhibitor&#160;4&#160;selectively modifies the catalytic lysine K745, thus potently inhibiting the activity of EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S kinase and corresponding engineered BaF3 cell proliferation as a single agent.








Abstract
Targeting lysine residues with covalent inhibitors is challenging due to their abundance in the proteome and the protonation of lysine's &#949;&#8208;amino group, which diminishes its reactivity. This study introduces diethenyl sulfoximine (DESI) as a novel bio&#8208;orthogonal aminophilic electrophile that can react with lysine via double conjugate addition to form a cyclic adduct. The second addition promotes the entire and efficient electrophilic attack by the &#949;&#8208;amino of lysine on the ethenyl groups. DESI exhibits superior aqueous stability, overcoming the hydrolysis issue encountered by most reported lysine&#8208;targeting covalent agents. Incorporation of DESI in the allosteric pocket binder EAI045 of oncoprotein epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) yields compound 4, which specifically reacts to the catalytic lysine (Lys745). Compound 4 showed potent inhibition of EGFR&#8208;driven cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.789&#160;&#181;M and 1.22&#160;&#181;M in engineered BaF3&#8208;EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S and NCI&#8208;H1975 cells, respectively, overcoming EAI045's limitation of lack of cellular potency as a single agent. Tyrosine kinases (TKs) panel profiling confirmed selectivity toward mutant EGFR while sparing the wild type with minimal off&#8208;targets. These findings highlight DESI's potential as a versatile strategy for targeting lysine residues irreversibly, offering solutions to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy and advance next&#8208;generation precision medicines.

Compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; showed potent inhibition of EGFR-driven cell proliferation with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.789&#160;&#181;M and 1.22&#160;&#181;M in engineered BaF3-EGFR&lt;sup&gt;L858R/T790M/C797S&lt;/sup&gt; and NCI-H1975 cells, respectively, overcoming EAI045's limitation of lack of cellular potency as a single agent. Tyrosine kinases (TKs) panel profiling confirmed selectivity toward mutant EGFR while sparing the wild type with minimal off-targets. These findings highlight DESI's potential as a versatile strategy for targeting lysine residues irreversibly, offering solutions to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy and advance next-generation precision medicines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of an Auxiliary Donor and Ethynyl &#960;&#8208;Spacer in a New Phenothiazine Derivative as a Dye for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of incorporating an auxiliary donor (4&#8208;methoxyethynyl moiety) into the PTZ structure on key physicochemical properties&#8212;such as thermal, optical, and electrochemical characteristics&#8212;as well as on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices was investigated. The study was further supported by theoretical calculations.








Abstract
A new donor&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(7&#8208;(2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acrylic acid (PEDCA) has been synthesized in good yield and was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopies. The obtained phenothiazine (PTZ) derivative was explored in dye&#8208;sensitized and tandem dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (TDSCs). For reference purposes, the devices based on commercial organometallic dye N719 and a similar PTZ&#8208;based dye but without auxiliary donor and ethynyl &#960;&#8208;spacer, that is, 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)acrylic acid (PEC) were used. The experimental results had also been supported by theoretical calculations performed by employing density functional theory. It was observed that the presence of an auxiliary donor and an ethynyl &#960;&#8208;spacer in PTZ unexpectedly decreased the molar absorption coefficient. However, this modification positively influenced the dye loading on the photoanode, which led to a 37% increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSSC) compared to the device sensitized with PEC. Further modifications to the device architecture allowed to obtain DSSC with efficiency above 7%. Despite the fact that the molar absorption coefficients of the PEC solution were higher compared to the PEDCA solution, the key issue is the number of dye molecules, which determines the photocurrent obtained, as shown in the following studies.

         <title>Discotic Liquid Crystalline Phenazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenazines, otherwise known as dibenzo annulated pyrazines, are a unique class of tricyclic organic molecules. They are chemically stable and highly aromatic due to their extended conjugation. Along with their biomedicinal significance, phenazines often play a major role in manipulating the optical as well as electrical properties of organic semiconductors. The planar structure in the heterocyclic aromatic phenazines and their natural inclination to form stacked columns due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between two consecutive molecules has made them quite a suitable moiety for the formation as well as extension of the core part of discotic liquid crystals. Their charge&#8208;carrying ability in electrolytes makes them well&#8208;suited for organic electronic materials. Furthermore, their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned with simple chemical changes rendering them appropriate for many advanced applications. This review focuses on the chemistry of phenazine&#8208;based discotic liquid crystals and their significance in optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent&#160;N6&#160;Versus&#160;Cvinyl&#160;Arylation of 8&#8208;Vinyl Adenine Nucleosides, Sequential Diarylation, Fluorescence Properties, and Computational Evaluations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary tranformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#8211;N versus C&#8211;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl adenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of BICAAC Organocatalyst: Hydroboration of Carbonyl and Alkyne Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (BICAAC) (I) has been used as a highly effective catalyst for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones and alkynes. The catalyst is effective across a broad range of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, indicating its robust functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, supported by both experimental studies and computational analyses, suggest the initial step involves the reaction of BICAAC (I) with pinacolborane (HBpin), leading to the formation of boron&#8211;carbene complex (active catalyst II). This active species facilitates substrate activation. A subsequent hydride transfer from an additional equivalent of HBpin to the activated substrate completes the reduction process. This stepwise mechanism underscores the dual role of HBpin as both a catalyst activator and a hydride donor. The interaction between BICAAC and HBpin is pivotal, as it modulates the electronic environment of the boron center to promote efficient hydride delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>The Nature and Stability of Transition Metal&#8208;Anchored Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene single&#8208;atom catalysts represent an emerging class of catalysts that combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To prevent demetallation and ensure catalyst stability, sufficiently strong bonds between the transition metal and support are essential. We have quantum chemically analyzed the trend in bonding interaction between period 4 transition metals (TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and the four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support. We find that the metal&#8211;support interactions strengthen from Ti to Ni but weaken from Ni to Zn. Activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that this trend stems from changes in the interaction between the metal&#8217;s 3dxy&#160;atomic orbital and the nitrogen lone pair orbitals of the support. As we move along period 4, the bonding mechanism changes from&#160;an increasingly more stabilizing HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction (TM = Ti&#8208;Ni), due to the higher effective nuclear charge of the metal, to a less favorable HOMO&#8211;SOMO (TM = Cu) and unfavorable HOMO&#8211;HOMO (TM = Zn) interaction, as a result of the filling of the metal&#8217;s 3dxy&#160;atomic orbital. This results in the observed strengthening, followed by weakening, of the metal&#8211;support interaction. These insights could guide the rational design of future single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Heterotrimetallic Assemblies Based on Rod&#8208;Shaped FeII&#8208;Metalloligands and a ZnII&#8208;Porphyrin/RuII&#8208;Metallacycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient strategy for the preparation of heterometallic discrete porphyrin assemblies, tuned both in dimensions and number of metal centers, is described. Five rod&#8208;shaped di&#8208;pyridyl FeII&#8208;metalloligands, with varied length (1.5 &#8211; 3.2 nm), lateral substituents, and number of iron centers, were used to bridge two RuII&#8208;metallacycles, made of two coplanar ZnII&#8208;porphyrin each. The resulting architectures consist of four RuII complexes, four zinc&#8208;porphyrins, and either two or four FeII&#8208;clathrochelate units. Earlier, geometrically similar sandwich&#8208;like architectures were based on purely organic connectors. Among other novel characteristics, the use of metalloligands was found to be beneficial for the overall stability, thus allowing for a solution&#8208;based characterization of the assemblies. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures were determined for the complete collection, highlighting additional key features: the two facing ZnII&#8208;porphyrin platforms are set wide apart according to the span of the two connecting metalloligands, while the latter are parallelly aligned by the anchoring ZnII&#8208;porphyrin/RuII&#8208;metallacycles, at fixed inter Fe&#183;&#183;Fe distance(s). Mutual control over these geometrical parameters is very strict, as evidenced by self&#8208;sorting experiments. Useful implementation of these systems into functional systems may be envisaged by pairing the peripheral metalloporphyrin photosensitizers with photo/redox/catalytically active inner metal cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrile Hydroboration by Cooperative Iron Catalysis: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the Fe&#8208;catalyzed double hydroboration of nitriles using HBpin as the terminal reductant. Mechanistic studies, both experimental and computational, reveal a unique and unreported mechanistic pathway for iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration where reductive elimination, rather than B&#9472;H bond activation is the rate&#8208; limiting step.








Abstract
Reductive amination is a challenging reaction in catalysis that often gives poor yield and selectivity. We present an iron&#8208;catalyzed approach of synthesizing amines through reduction of nitriles through hydroboration with good yield under ambient conditions. Our detailed mechanistic study establishes the factors that influence the selectivity and turnover. The kinetics and mechanism of the iron&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of benzonitrile to bis(boryl)benzylamine have been investigated by initial rates, temperature dependence, kinetic isotope effects, and computational studies. In contrast to other iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrile hydroboration, this study reveals that B&#9472;H bond activation is not rate&#8208;determining. Moreover, the rate&#8208;determining step was revealed to be C&#9472;H bond reductive elimination with an equilibrium isotope effect in operation. Through this combined approached, an Fe(0)/(II) catalytic manifold proceeding via metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity has been determined.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium Catalysts by Co&#8208;Cyclization of Two Different Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various rhodium catalysts with densely substituted pi&#8208;ligands have been synthesized in one step by selective co&#8208;cyclization of two alkynes. Tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;acetylene typically gives cyclopentadienyl ligands, whereas trimethylsilyl&#8208;acetylene produces pentalene&#8208;type structures. The resulting complexes catalyze regioselective C&#9472;H activation and annulation of arylhydroxamic acids.








Abstract
Cyclopentadienyl rhodium complexes (C5R5)RhLx are widely used as homogeneous catalysts. Herein we report the synthesis of such complexes with structurally diverse cyclopentadienyl ligands in one step directly from alkynes. Specifically, reactions of bulky terminal alkynes (tert&#8208;butylacetylene or trimethylsilylacetylene) with activated internal alkynes (ethyl 2&#8208;butynoate or dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD)) and [(cod)RhCl]2 produce either cyclopentadienyl or pentalene&#8208;type complexes (L)Rh(cod) in 60&#8211;95% yields. Oxidation of these Rh(I) complexes with halogens afforded the corresponding Rh(III) derivatives [(L)RhHal2]2, which can catalyze C&#9472;H activation of phenylhydroxamate, giving products with varying regioselectivity depending on the substituents in pi&#8208;ligands.

         <title>Fluorenyl Cations: Synthesis and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno's first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy while recent developments led to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno's first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy. The most common synthetic routes to fluorenyl cations are by dehydroxylation and halide abstraction of substituted fluorenyl precursors. Over the 71 year history, many advancements have been made with recent developments leading to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The scope of this review covers the field of fluorenyl cations in addition to related species with different aromatic groups in place of benzene fused to the cycopentadienyl core.

         <title>Removal of Phaeocystis Globosa From Seawater via Polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;Modified Pyrite Activated Persulfate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa) is a highly motile and toxic harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in marine environments. The outbreak of P. globosa poses severe threats to aquaculture and coastal nuclear power safety and causes economic losses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel algal removal technologies to control P. globosa blooms. Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;modified pyrite (PVP&#8208;FeS2) was synthesized as a catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for removing P. globosa in seawater. The introduction of PVP effectively modulated the morphology, particle size, and catalytic performance of FeS2. The results demonstrated that a system containing 0.3&#160;g/L PVP&#8208;FeS&#8322; and 0.8&#160;mM PS achieved 95.9% removal efficiency of P. globosa within 4&#160;hours. The Fe and S species on the PVP&#8208;FeS2 surface played critical roles in activating PS to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) for algal cell oxidation and produce iron hydroxides to promote the flocculation of algal cells. In addition, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system maintained the integrity of algal cells and avoided the release of large amounts of intracellular organic matter. More importantly, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system can simultaneously remove multiple HABs from seawater, and is expected to be applied in the field of emergency mitigation of red tide events.

The reactions of the monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1) with potassium alkoxides KOR provided potassium hydrido&#8208;alkoxo&#8208;germanato&#8208;borates {K(THF)2[BH3&#183;Ge(L)(H)(OR)]}2 (R&#160;=&#160;tBu (2), C(CH3)2CH2CH3 (3)) as products of KOR addition. Compounds 2 and 3 react with benzaldehyde under formation of alkyl esters of benzoic acid along with elimination of a neutral complex L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1). Thus complex 1 was tested as a useful catalyst for esterification of aldehydes by KOtBu. The GC&#8208;MS analysis revealed formation of t&#8208;butyl esters of appropriated carboxylic acids. The mechanistic studies for the esterification of benzaldehyde with KOtBu catalyzed by 1 were also performed either theoretically (DFT calculations), or experimentally (NMR and IR spectroscopy).

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release of Branched Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release branched prodrugs can amplify the amount of cargo activated. However, balance between the &#8220;click&#8221; and &#8220;release&#8221; steps is essential. Branched pro&#8208;fluorophores provided the fastest&#8208;to&#8208;date click reaction of aryl azides and TCOs. The second branched core enabled the self&#8208;immolation, releasing higher levels of fluorophore than the corresponding monomeric profluorophores.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug activation strategies should be fast and high yielding. However, in strain&#8208;promoted alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release, a fast click&#8208;step translates to slow and inefficient drug release. To improve drug yield, branched dual&#8208;core scaffolds that increase drug release are reported. The dual&#8208;core consists of an exposed electron&#8208;deficient aryl azide (core&#8208;1) attached to an electron&#8208;rich self&#8208;immolating branched linker (core&#8208;2). Core&#8208;1, a tetrafluoroaryl azide with methyl&#8208;substitution at the benzylic carbon, facilitates a rapid click reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCOs). Core&#8208;2 had an N&#8208;methyl carbamate or ether linker and a 1,4/1,4&#8208; or 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating scaffold. Various release rates of a fluorophore were observed across the series, with 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating core&#8208;2, linked via the N&#8208;methyl carbamate, having sustained and enhanced fluorophore release. The second&#8208;order rate constant for cycloaddition of this 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating analogue and d&#8208;TCO is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest to date (22.0 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). A persistent intermediate was observed, leading to a long, sustained release of fluorophore from the branched scaffold, though activation under acidic conditions (pH&#160;=&#160;5.5) led to&#160;&#8776;&#160;15% higher fluorophore release compared to activation at pH 7.4. Therefore, combinations of core&#8208;1 and core&#8208;2 could improve future pretargeted in vivo bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug strategies, especially in the acidic tumor environment.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones Using Primary Alcohols: Unveiling the Role of Manganese&#8208;Salen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electronically and sterically modulated Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) have been synthesized. Thorough investigation of the catalytic efficiency of the synthesized complexes demonstrates excellent catalytic performance for the selective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols through HA. The results highlight the emergent role of Mn&#8208;salen complexes in &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions.








Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols has been systematically investigated using two distinct phosphine&#8208;free manganese&#8208;complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) bearing tetradentate Salen ligands. Remarkably, the complex Mn&#8208;ph with an aromatic imine bridge was found to be efficient in comparison to Mn&#8208;en, leading to an excellent yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketone with good selectivity under operationally convenient conditions. Interestingly, a wide range of aromatic, cyclic, and heterocyclic ketones are effectively alkylated under the optimized reaction conditions. Notably, the transformation proceeds via an environmentally benign and atom&#8208;efficient pathway, generating water as the sole byproduct. The control experiments reveal the involvement of dehydrogenation of alcohols and hydrogen autotransfer (HA) pathway. These findings highlight the potential of Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes in catalytic HA processes, expanding their applications in sustainable C&#160;&#9472;&#160;C bond formation strategies.

         <title>Fluorinated Trimers for Enhancing the Stability and Solubility of Organic Small Molecules Without Spectral Shifts: Ultrastable Ultraviolet Absorbers for Transparent Polyimide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The development of highly stable organic small molecules for optical applications is of growing interest. Multimerization of monomeric small molecules can enhance stability via increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, but it often reduces solubility and induces undesirable spectral shifts due to &#960;&#8208;extension. To overcome this trade&#8208;off, we report a trimeric small molecule (F&#8208;TPBT) derived from a model monomer (Tinuvin 327) using a 1,3,5&#8208;fluorinated phenyl linker. This design markedly improves thermal stability and solubility while minimizing changes in the optical absorption spectrum. F&#8208;TPBT shows superior thermal properties (5 wt% decomposition temperature&#160;=&#160;427&#160;&#176;C; weight loss after 1&#160;hour at 300&#160;&#176;C&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;wt%) and excellent solubility (5.3 wt% in dichloromethane; 6.4 wt% in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP)), with an absorption spectrum nearly identical to that of Tinuvin 327. These properties make F&#8208;TPBT a promising UV light absorber for transparent polyimide (TPI) films, which require processing above 300&#160;&#176;C and are widely used in flexible displays. Notably, F&#8208;TPBT&#8208;containing films retain their absorption properties even after 80&#160;hours of accelerated UV irradiation, demonstrating excellent photostability. This study presents a broadly applicable molecular design strategy for enhancing the stability and solubility of organic small molecules while avoiding significant spectral shifts.

         <title>Front Cover: Glycans and Chirality: Stereoselectivity at the Core of DC&#8208;SIGN's Recognition. A Novel View of the Optimum Minimal Ligand Epitope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates how a lectin of our human immune system recognises glycans. The stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables the binding of chiral motifs from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;series. The capacity of DC&#8208;SIGN to bind monosaccharides from the other side of the mirror is demonstrated, extending the chemical space for developing glycomimetics of biomedical interest. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Jim&#233;nez&#8208;Barbero, G. Jim&#233;nez&#8208;Oses, F.&#160;J. Ca&#241;ada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501420).

Kids ride on macrocycles sliding down a water slide that represents the rotaxane thread. Gates marked &#8220;base&#8221; and &#8220;fluoride&#8221; open to release the macrocycles, shown by the kids sliding down. The &#8220;acid&#8221; and &#8220;CuAAC&#8221; gates allow the kids to climb back up the stairs and slide again, symbolizing how the macrocycles are recaptured. This playful scene highlights the controlled release and recapture of the macrocycle enabled by chemical stimuli. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Kundu, J. Niemeyer and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501106).

         <title>Strategies Toward Synthesis and Conversion of Lignin Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin toward value&#8208;added products relies on the cleavage of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;O bonding patterns, which has proven to be a difficult task previously, with numerous factors at play. The employment of model compounds which are fashioned on the structure and linkages found within lignin aids in the development of catalytic processes which can then be applied for the scission of linkages within native lignin. This review focuses on the strategies which have been used for the synthesis and conversion of key model compounds of lignin and the products obtained following their breakdown studies.








Abstract
The push toward a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds, and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorization.

         <title>Review of Metal Nitrides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Design, Mechanisms, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article explores the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries enhanced by metal nitrides, detailing the synthesis methods, morphological characteristics, and size&#8208;dependent effects. It also discusses underlying design principles for metal nitrides and outlines future directions for their application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSB) emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in underachievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure, thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties, including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects, have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focuses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides toward the capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with the inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology, and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides, along with future directions, are discussed.

         <title>Unleashing the Biosensing Potential of 2D Inorganic Nanomaterials: the Journey of a Decade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D inorganic nanomaterials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), MXenes, black phosphorus (BP) and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), have transformed biosensing. Their superior conductivity, extensive surface area and biocompatibility facilitates disease detection and diagnosis. This review underscores recent advancements, focusing on their physicochemical characteristics and biosensing potential in healthcare.








Abstract
With the growing need for rapid, sensitive and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensors, 2D nanomaterials have gained significant attention, establishing them as versatile candidates for advanced biomedical applications. Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real&#8208;time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities and enhancing the understanding of the human biosystem. Since they are cost&#8208;effective and user&#8208;friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors. Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area and tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhance their sensitivity and specificity.

         <title>Phosphor&#8208;Assisted TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescence (pTSF) OLEDs: Faster Excitons, Brighter Futures</title>

Phosphor&#8208;assisted TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) synergizes phosphorescent/thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to break spin&#8208;flip cycles in the TADF host, achieving near roll&#8208;off&#8208;free efficiency and enhanced stability at ultrahigh luminance via accelerated exciton dynamics. This review evaluates pTSF's potential for ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs (&gt;104&#160;cd m&#8722;2) through material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes.








Abstract
The impressive efficiency and lifetime under ultrahigh luminance remain a long&#8208;standing challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), as conventional fluorescent, phosphorescent, and thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) systems universally suffer from accelerated bimolecular annihilation at elevated exciton densities. Recently, phosphor&#8208;assisted TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) has emerged as a groundbreaking architecture that synergistically integrates exciton utilization enhancement and radiative decay acceleration through breaking the singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip cycles in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) hosts via multiple sensitizations. The OLEDs based on pTSF achieve not only a nearly roll&#8208;off&#8208;free on external quantum efficiency but also a remarkable power efficiency, even when operating at ultrahigh luminance levels exceeding 100,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. In this review, we delve into the intricacies of pTSF technology, examining its material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes. Eventually, we critically assess the challenges in implementing pTSF for blue&#8208;emitting OLEDs and propose strategic research directions to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.

         <title>Spectroscopic Interrogation of Thiolate Hydrogen Bonding in the CO Sensor Protein CooA: Implications for Thiolate Ligation Stability and Cytochrome P450 Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme proteins are important biomolecules. Proximal cysteine thiolate ligation is found both in heme enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (CYP) and regulatory proteins such as CooA, a CO sensor. The role of H&#8208;bonding to this cysteine is explored in CooA, including variants, and CYP119 using optical and paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, which highlight key differences between these two heme systems.









Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) thiolate coordination in hemoproteins is a unique ligation motif found in enzymes and small molecule sensors. It is posited that divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. To further test this hypothesis, we report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H&#8208;bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide&#8208;sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H&#8208;bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H&#8208;bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H&#8208;bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, a cytochrome P450, to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. Our data unequivocally show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate&#8208;Fe bond than the pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H&#8208;bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results support the hypothesis that thiolate H&#8208;bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.

         <title>Tunable Emission in Cu(I)/Mn(II) Codoped 2D Hybrid Cd Chloride Perovskites for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes and Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu+/Mn2+&#8208;codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites with tunable emission are synthesized. Cu+ and Mn2+ can lead to green STE emission and orange&#8208;red emission from Mn2+ 4T1&#8594;6A1 transitions, respectively. Interestingly, the two emission centers contribute to high&#8208;efficiency tunable white light emission.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it remains challenging to achieve highly efficient white light emission in 2D systems. Herein, white light emitting Cu+/Mn2+ codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites are synthesized via a facile fabrication method. The host is weakly emissive. However, Cu+ and Mn2+ doping can lead to strong green and orange&#8208;red emission, respectively. Spectroscopic characterizations show that there are two independent emission centers, the Cu+&#8208;induced extrinsic self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE), which leads to the green emission, and the isolated Mn2+ ion which results in orange&#8208;red emission via the inherent 4T1(G)&#8594;6A1(S) transition. Interestingly, by optimizing the ratio of Cu+ and Mn2+, the codoped sample can exhibit tunable white light emission with variable correlated color temperatures and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 45.2%&#8211;51.1%. In addition, the codoped samples can also exhibit interesting excitation&#8208;dependent emission properties. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite luminescent materials.

         <title>Modulating Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly via Triblock Chiral Patterning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral block patterning influences peptide self&#8208;assembly by directing molecular orientation, which results in distinct morphologies and packing configurations. This alters the gel's mechanical properties, thereby impacting its applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Our research shows that integrating chiral motifs can modify peptide nanostructures, providing flexible strategies for tailoring functional biomaterials.








Abstract
The suprastructural integrity of peptide self&#8208;assemblies is driven by an intricate array of cohesive interactions that guide and maintain a hierarchical order. Seemingly minor alterations to atomic arrangement, such as substitution with D&#8208;amino acids, can dramatically affect assembly potential and resultant architecture. When a primary sequence is comprised of consecutive identical motifs, &#8220;block heterochiral&#8221; peptides can be generated by partitioning chiral inversions according to these underlying elementary units. In this work, we present a combinatorial exploration of all triblock chiral patterns for the model &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide KFE12 (Ac&#8208;(FKFE)3&#8208;NH2). Analysis of the four resulting enantiomer pairs reveals that each produces a unique morphology, ranging from minimal 4&#8208;nm&#8208;wide fibrils to micron&#8208;scale semi&#8208;structured aggregates. Our investigation of these variants illustrates a combination of conserved and divergent hierarchical features, reflecting complex interplay between persistent fundamental forces and the unique spatial implications of blockwise intramolecular chiral interfaces.

     alt="Modulating Peptide Self-Assembly via Triblock Chiral Patterning"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral block patterning influences peptide self-assembly by directing molecular orientation, which results in distinct morphologies and packing configurations. This alters the gel's mechanical properties, thereby impacting its applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Our research shows that integrating chiral motifs can modify peptide nanostructures, providing flexible strategies for tailoring functional biomaterials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suprastructural integrity of peptide self-assemblies is driven by an intricate array of cohesive interactions that guide and maintain a hierarchical order. Seemingly minor alterations to atomic arrangement, such as substitution with D-amino acids, can dramatically affect assembly potential and resultant architecture. When a primary sequence is comprised of consecutive identical motifs, &#8220;block heterochiral&#8221; peptides can be generated by partitioning chiral inversions according to these underlying elementary units. In this work, we present a combinatorial exploration of all triblock chiral patterns for the model &#946;-sheet-forming peptide KFE12 (Ac-(FKFE)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Analysis of the four resulting enantiomer pairs reveals that each produces a unique morphology, ranging from minimal 4-nm-wide fibrils to micron-scale semi-structured aggregates. Our investigation of these variants illustrates a combination of conserved and divergent hierarchical features, reflecting complex interplay between persistent fundamental forces and the unique spatial implications of blockwise intramolecular chiral interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Complexant for Minor Actinide Separation of Actinides from Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since initial employment in liquid&#8211;liquid separations for minor actinides (An) from lanthanides (Ln) contained within used nuclear fuel, all previously reported examples of bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP) complexants have been C2 symmetric about the pyridine N axis. Symmetry is postulated to limit solvent access to the polar surface area of complexant topography potentially resulting in low solubility in nonpolar diluents. In this work the unsymmetric BTP, 3&#8208;(6&#8208;(5,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;butoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine, a polar molecule, was found to have good solubility in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene, rapid complexation, high chemoselectivity for 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+, efficient decomplexation without additives, and was recyclable through multiple extractions. Liquid&#8211;liquid extraction, decomplexation, spectroscopic, and DFT calculations are presented.








Abstract
Advancements in the separation of the minor actinides (An) from the neutron&#8208;poisoning post fission lanthanides (Ln) via the partitioning and transmutation strategy are vital toward closure of the nuclear fuel cycle, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and minimizing the environmental impact of energy production. Recent advancements in complexant&#8208;based separations strategies have realized substantive gains in ease of synthetic access, process&#8208;relevant diluent solubility, in addition to stability in strongly acidic environments. As purposeful exploration of chemoselective chelating agents moves forward, rapid, selective, and reversible actinide binding are at the forefront. In this work, the utility of a non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric, bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP)&#8208;type complexant for the selective extraction of 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+ from simulated high&#8208;level waste is reported. High separation factors (SFs) in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene 50:50 (v/v), equilibration within 15 minutes of contact time, decomplexation with dilute acid only, and recyclability of a discrete complexant for additional extractions were achieved. Separations, spectroscopic, and DFT calculation data supporting the observed experimental results are disclosed herein.

Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of tris(N,N&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;dimethylamido&#8208;guanidinate)molybdenum(III), Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 is reported. This complex expands the known scope of tris(guanidinate)M(III) complexes to include Mo, and adds to the very limited knowledge of homoleptic mononuclear Mo(III) coordination complexes. Volatility of Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 is demonstrated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), hinting at potential applications as a molecular precursor for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Proof of concept aerosol&#8208;assisted CVD growth with Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 as a single&#8208;source precursor yielded MoCxNy films. The results indicate a potential utility for Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 as a volatile precursor for ALD and CVD, with prospective use as a single&#8208;source precursor for growth of molybdenum nitrides and carbonitrides.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Aluminum Nanoparticles: Insights from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with varying coordination numbers were synthesized. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals were isolated from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures, and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The coordination number of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x modulates the morphology of Al nanoparticles. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution.








Abstract
The controlled chemical synthesis of aluminum nanocrystals (Al NCs) is crucial for their applications in plasmonics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics. However, there is still a lack of correlation between the precursor of Al hydride N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (AlH3&#183;(NMP)x) and the Al NC synthesis outcomes. Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Importantly, AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased dispersity in size and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.

         <title>Oxidative Folding of a Two&#8208;Chain Protein Having Three Interchain Disulfide Bonds. Synthesis of Bromelain Inhibitor VI Through Native Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromelain inhibitor VI, a two&#8208;chain protein stabilized by three interchain SS bonds and two intrachain SS bonds, was synthesized in an incredibly high isolated yield (53%) just by mixing the two native chains in a buffer solution. This success made a record of oxidative protein folding for the most complicated and difficult one.

The recently renovated two&#8208;chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different&#8208;type two&#8208;chain protein, that is, bromelain inhibitor VI (BI&#8208;VI), which has abundant &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)&#8208; and light (L)&#8208;chains of BI&#8208;VI were mixed at 4&#160;&#176;C in a pH of 10.0 buffer solution containing 2&#160;mM GSH and 0.4&#160;mM GSSG, native BI&#8208;VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53%) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI&#8208;VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non&#8208;activity. The rate&#8208;limiting step of the two&#8208;chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three&#8208;SS intermediates of the H&#8208;chain (3SSH) and one&#8208;SS intermediates of the L&#8208;chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multichain proteins with more complicated SS&#8208;bond topologies.

&lt;p&gt;Bromelain inhibitor VI, a two-chain protein stabilized by three interchain SS bonds and two intrachain SS bonds, was synthesized in an incredibly high isolated yield (53%) just by mixing the two native chains in a buffer solution. This success made a record of oxidative protein folding for the most complicated and difficult one.

         <title>Conformational Switch in the Alpha&#8208;Synuclein C&#8208;Terminal Domain Directs Its Fibril Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational state of the C&#8208;terminal domain determines the fibril morphology of full&#8208;length wild&#8208;type alpha&#8208;synuclein: high C&#8208;terminus flexibility promotes twisted fibrils, while partial C&#8208;terminal folding drives the assembly of rod&#8208;like fibrils.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;Syn) inclusions are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders. While cryo&#8208;electron microscopy studies have revealed distinct fibril polymorphs across different synucleinopathies, the molecular switches controlling polymorphism remain unveiled. In this study, we found that fibril morphology is associated with the conformational state of monomeric &#945;Syn. Through systematic evaluation of the ionic strength and temperature, we generated two distinct polymorphs: a twisted morphology at low ionic strength and temperature, and a rod&#8208;like morphology at higher ionic strength and temperature. Using solid&#8208;state NMR, we revealed that both polymorphs share a highly conserved core structure, with morphological differences arising probably from distinct structural arrangements at the protofilament interfaces. Furthermore, we found that a specific conformational change in the C&#8208;terminal domain of the monomeric &#945;Syn serves as a molecular switch for the formation of polymorphs. Interestingly, this conformational change can also be triggered by calcium binding to the C&#8208;terminus, connecting environmental factors to specific fibril architectures. Our results reveal a conformational role for the C&#8208;terminal domain that influences &#945;Syn fibril morphology, providing significant insights into the fibrogenesis of &#945;Syn.

         <title>Enhanced Protein Photo&#8208;Stability Analysis Using SRCD in the Presence of Phospholipid SUVs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of lipid presence on the photostability of proteins was assessed using a synchrotron radiation circular dichroism UV&#8208;denaturation experiment at Diamond B23 beamline. The presence of SUVs preserves the native structure in proteins, particularly in those with a high helical content, suggesting that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.








Abstract
The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and aging. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerization is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV&#8208;denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. The high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beam light of Diamond Light Source B23 for sinchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) was used to induce protein denaturation. This was acheived by scanning 30 repeated consecutive SRCD spectra in the far&#8208;UV region that, being diagnostic of protein folding, enabled the estimation of the protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.

         <title>Electrodeposition of PTCTA/ZnO Composite Films for Acetic Acid Vapor Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents PTCTA/ZnO composite films for efficient room&#8208;temperature acetic acid sensing. The enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the synergistic effects of the formation of p&#8208;n heterojunction effect and the porous structure of PTCTA/ZnO composite.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor sensors based on zinc oxide (ZnO) and its composites are found to be very sensitive in detecting acetic acid vapor. However, its operating temperatures usually exceed 200&#160;&#176;C. In this work, an environmentally friendly and controllable electrochemical approach for constructing poly(4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine) (PTCTA) and ZnO composite films was successfully obtained for acetic acid sensing at room temperature. The conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films of PTCTA were synthesized via an electropolymerization (EP) method using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine (TCTA) molecule as a precursor. Subsequently, ZnO was deposited in situ to fabricate homogeneous PTCTA/ZnO composite films. The resulting PTCTA/ZnO composite films achieved a response value of 2.42 for 200&#160;ppm acetic acid vapor at room temperature, which was significantly outperforming standalone PTCTA or ZnO films. This enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the porous structure, the synergistic effects of the p&#8208;n heterojunction at the PTCTA/ZnO interface and the oxygen adsorption/desorption occurring on the ZnO surface. What's more, PTCTA/ZnO composite films demonstrated structural stability and flexibility. The results suggested that the developed novel PTCTA/ZnO composite films showed great potential for acetic acid determination.

         <title>Two Key Ferredoxins for Nitrogen Fixation Have Different Specificities and Biophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, are collectively essential for the process of nitrogen fixation by the iron nitrogenase in R. capsulatus. We explore the biophysical factors, through spectroscopic and structural characterizations, which determine ferredoxin functionality and pathway specificity. The structure of FdC (PDB: 9I2A) and model of FdN (AF&#8208;D5ARY6) are shown, nitrogen fixation by the iron nitrogenase is depicted (PDB: 8OIE).








Abstract
Ferredoxins deliver electrons to drive many challenging biochemical transformations, including enzyme&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. We recently showed two distinct ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, were essential for iron nitrogenase&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation in R. capsulatus. In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure, and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (fdxC) and FdN (fdxN), into &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN R. capsulatus&#8208;deletion strains under N2&#8208;fixing conditions, showed that plasmid&#8208;based expression of fdxN recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe&#8208;nitrogenase activity in both &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN strains, while plasmid&#8208;based fdxC expression could only complement the &#8710;fdxC strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe2S2]&#8208;cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, while providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N2&#8208;fixation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferredoxins deliver electrons to drive many challenging biochemical transformations, including enzyme-catalyzed nitrogen fixation. We recently showed two distinct ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, were essential for iron nitrogenase-mediated nitrogen fixation in &lt;i&gt;R. capsulatus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure, and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (&lt;i&gt;fdxC&lt;/i&gt;) and FdN (&lt;i&gt;fdxN&lt;/i&gt;), into &#8710;&lt;i&gt;fdxC&lt;/i&gt; and &#8710;&lt;i&gt;fdxN R. capsulatus&lt;/i&gt;-deletion strains under N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing conditions, showed that plasmid-based expression of &lt;i&gt;fdxN&lt;/i&gt; recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe-nitrogenase activity in both &#8710;&lt;i&gt;fdxC&lt;/i&gt; and &#8710;&lt;i&gt;fdxN&lt;/i&gt; strains, while plasmid-based &lt;i&gt;fdxC&lt;/i&gt; expression could only complement the &#8710;&lt;i&gt;fdxC&lt;/i&gt; strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen-bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]-cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, while providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigation of the Degree of Functionalization and Colloidal Stability of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Functionalized TiO2 Nanoparticles as a Function of Different Phosphonic Acid Chain Lengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell structures of TiO2 nanoparticles, phosphonic acids (PAs) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) in their solid and colloidal state were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and analytical ultracentrifugation. This combination showed that agglomerates were formed whose size depended on the PA chain length. This allowed conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and SDBS.








Abstract
In this work, a series of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell (SbS)&#8208;functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6&#160;nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2&#8208;PACX@SDBS (X&#160;=&#160;3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first&#8208;shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chains.

         <title>Directional Macrocycle Transport, Release, and Recapture Enabled by a Rotaxane Transporter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study represents a bistable rotaxane that enables the directional shuttling, release, and recapture of a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle upon addition of suitable chemical stimuli. This two&#8208;step molecular transport and release can be followed by NMR and distinct changes in the molecular fluorescence. Based on rational molecular design, the liberated macrocycle is recaptured on to the thread and the mechanical bond is regenerated which allows for directional macrocycle transport and release in an iterative manner.








Abstract
A transporter for a directional macrocycle transport, release, and recapture was constructed. This was achieved using a rotaxane featuring a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle, dibenzylammonium (DBA)/methyl triazolium (MTA) stations on the thread and anthracene/triisopropylsilyl&#8208;acetylene stoppers, respectively. In the protonated rotaxane, the macrocycle primarily resides on the DBA station, followed by directional shuttling to the MTA station upon treatment with base. Addition of fluoride as an additional chemical input cleaves the triisopropylsilyl stopper, leading to release of the macrocycle and the half&#8208;thread into solution. The released macrocycle can be recaptured by protonation, and the mechanical bond can be reestablished via CuAAC click reaction, enabled by the terminal acetylene unit on the half&#8208;thread. This generates an elongated second&#8208;generation rotaxane transporter, which was used for a second cycle of directional macrocycle transport and release, proving the possibility of an iterative operation of the rotaxane&#8208;transporter in this molecular design.

A photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective reductive coupling reaction of conjugated dienes was developed. This transformation provides a platform for synthesizing optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters.








Abstract
The merger of palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions with photochemical radical chemistry represents a cutting&#8208;edge field in transition metal catalysis. We report a photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Heck/reductive allylic homocoupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes. The transformation has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform to synthesize optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters. The reaction initiates with a Heck&#8208;type addition to generate a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;PdII species, followed by a photoredox process or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) to generate an allylic radical, which undergoes homocoupling to give the final product.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;polarity solvent, a [2]rotaxane formed kinetic aggregates showing blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission. The kinetic aggregates gradually transformed into thermodynamic aggregates. During the transformation, the [2]rotaxane was exposed to the aqueous conditions, thus the location of the hydrophilic pillar[5]arene wheel changed, resulting in real&#8208;time monitoring of fluorescence color change from blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission to light&#8208;blue charge&#8211;transfer emission.








Abstract
The wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, the location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the aqueous conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light blue over 720&#160;h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the aqueouspola environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by the hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from the charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.

Chiral COSAN Nanocatalysts: Enantiopure silica COSAN&#8208;Hybrid nanohelices have been prepared by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of achiral COSAN anions and silica hybrid nanohelices. Their optical activity was confirmed by CD and ROA measurements. These COSAN&#8208;Hybrids are efficient and recoverable catalysts in the photooxidative kinetic resolution of aromatic secondary alcohols, achieving up to 85% ee.








Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8722;) named COSAN is a sandwich&#8208;type metallacarborane that has been widely explored in a variety of fields, due to its interesting physical and chemical properties. While COSAN and its derivatives have recently been investigated in catalysis, their chiral counterparts have, to our knowledge, never been investigated in asymmetric catalysis. This may be due to the difficulty associated with preparing and isolating enantiopure COSAN derivatives. Inspired by our previous work on the chiral induction of nanoscale silica helices on achiral objects, we prepared and characterized enantiopure COSAN&#8208;based left&#8208;and right&#8208;handed hybrid silica nanohelices (NANOCOSANs). In these structures, achiral COSAN anions are encapsulated within left&#8208;and right&#8208;handed organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid nanohelices, which serve as a chiral platform for COSAN in enantioselective transformations. The morphology and structural composition of these NANOCOSAN hybrids as well as the presence of COSAN species were confirmed using UV/Vis, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and solid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Their optical activity was demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and Raman optical activity (ROA), highlighting the induction of chirality from chiral hybrid nanohelices to the achiral COSAN anions. To the best of our knowledge, these NANOCOSAN hybrids represent the first examples of COSAN&#8208;based chiral systems displaying chiroptical effects. In addition, they show excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the photooxidation of secondary aromatic alcohols in water. Specifically, the left&#8208;handed NANOCOSAN that selectively oxidizes the (S)&#8208;alcohol, while the right&#8208;handed oxidizes the (R)&#8208;alcohol, achieving up to 85% enantiomeric excess (ee). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle catalytic experiment demonstrates the transfer of chiroptical properties from the hybrid nanohelices to the catalytically active and originally achiral COSAN anion, enabling supramolecular asymmetric catalysis. Remarkably, the catalyst was recovered and reused at least three times without any loss of catalytic activity or enantioselectivity. This study reports the first example of enantiopure COSAN&#8208;containing nanohelices, which can promote photooxidation of organic substrates in water with high enantioselectivity.

Native mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trisaccharides are converted into p&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides in a one&#8208;pot reaction using water as the solvent. A sequence of condensation reactions is used to construct the aromatic ring from acyclic precursors. Using this approach, a modular synthesis of SGLT2&#8208;inhibitor scaffolds was developed and applied to a novel protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of a nanomolar SGLT2 inhibitor.








Abstract
The synthesis of p&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from native mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trisaccharides is described. The one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step procedure uses water as the solvent and produces exclusively &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, the desired stereochemistry for most medicinal chemistry applications. The versatility of the approach is illustrated by the synthesis of the nanomolar SGLT2 inhibitor [3&#8208;(4&#8208;ethylbenzyl)phenyl]&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glucoside.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies and Phosphorus&#8208;Doped P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC Electrocatalysts Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>

We synthesized a phosphorus&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide with OV (P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC) as an efficient electrocatalyst for HER in the acidic environments. We indicate that P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC exhibits a low overpotential (122.68&#160;mV @ &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), a small Tafel slope (74.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), and excellent durability over 12 hours.








Abstract
Constructing nonprecious metal electrocatalysts with good hydrogen evolution activity is crucial for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. The synergistic optimization of the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption steps presents a challenge for the HER. Here, we have synthesized phosphorus&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide with oxygen vacancies(OV) (P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x) using a simple but effective hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination annealing. Interestingly, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x material exhibits unique characteristics that set it apart from conventional tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The introduction of OV and phosphorus doping creates an optimal structure that significantly improves the electronic properties and the catalytic sites. The OV enhance the material's ability to adsorb and activate water molecules, while phosphorus doping further modifies the electronic structure, facilitating more efficient hydrogen desorption. Meanwhile, the catalyst demonstrates a favorable urchin&#8208;like morphology with excellent supportability. Remarkably, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent HER performance and excellent durability. We indicate that P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x exhibits a small overpotential (122.68&#160;mV at &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), a low Tafel slope (74.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), and excellent durability over 12 hours. This work presents a significant advance for the development of tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts with anion doping and OV for HER in acidic media.

         <title>Cyanomethylation of Aldehydes on an Electrochemical Microflow System and Utility of Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Examination of the Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical cyanomethylation reaction was developed. Using the electrochemical microflow reactor enables the reaction to yield almost exclusively products. To find the best reaction conditions, we used the Gaussian process regression (GPR), and the flow rates and the current values were explored. Our cyanomethylation was completed with a semi&#8208;catalytic electrical input, and the mechanism was discussed based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds affords a &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile, which is very useful in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Although several electrochemical methods have also been reported to achieve cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds, dehydration as a major side reaction is a significant issue that needs to be prevented. An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the &#8220;best&#8221; reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning (ML) models. In addition, comparing the ML models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi&#8208;catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.

         <title>Boost of Chiroptical Responses Through the Enhancement of Electron Transition Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral spirobifluorene systems are peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended via Knoevenagel condensation to boost their electric transition dipole moments (ETDM). A direct ETDM&#8211;g&#8208;factor correlation is established through ECD and TD&#8208;DFT analyses. This strategy allows precise control of exciton coupling and chiroptical amplification in rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds, opening new avenues toward high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials.








Abstract
The development of robust chiroptical systems is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. Spirobifluorenes (SBFs) have proven to be versatile scaffolds for the construction of a wide variety of robust axially chiral compounds presenting strong chiroptical responses. Herein, we present a strategy for boosting the chiroptical responses via enhancing electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of interacting chromophores in C2&#8208;symmetric SBFs presenting exciton coupling. To experimentally validate this approach, we peripherally extended the SBF scaffold through Knoevenagel condensation with the aim of increasing the ETDM of the featured chromophores. The influence of the functionalization on the ETDM was investigated using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, enabling a detailed examination of the relationship between molecular structure and chiroptical properties. Our results demonstrate that peripheral functionalization of SBFs significantly enhances the electric transition dipole moment (ETDM) of the constituent chromophores, with each incremental increase in ETDM resulting in a five&#8208;fold enhancement of the g&#8208;factor, thereby substantially amplifying the overall chiroptical activity. This straightforward strategy underscores the importance of the ETDM of interacting chromophores in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties and provides a promising avenue for the rational design of high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Triphosphaallyl Cation Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

Imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted triphosphaallyl cations undergo selective P&#8211;C bond cleavage and form unprecedented bicyclic P&#8323;&#8208;Ga scaffolds with unique reactivity.









Abstract
Reduction of the triphosphaallyl species 6[GaCl4] with GaI[Ga2Cl7] affords the imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted (L) bicyclo[2.1.1]&#8208;triphosphane 10[Ga2Cl7], featuring an unprecedented Ga2Cl5&#8208;bridged P3 scaffold. Reactions of 10[Ga2Cl7] with nucleophiles (Cl&#8722; or NHC) result in rare, selective P&#8211;C bond cleavages, affording Ga2Cly&#8208;substituted triphosphiranes (LP3Ga2Cly, y = &#160;5, 6) via an intramolecular ring closure mechanism. Protonation of 6[GaCl4] gives rise to a similar ring closure, but without P&#8211;C bond cleavage, to afford the L2P3H+ salt 8[OTfGaCl3]2. Additionally, the palladium complex 26[GaCl4], formed through the reaction of 10[Ga2Cl7] with [Pd(PPh3)4], presents a novel bicyclic P3Pd moiety (LP3Pd(PPh3)2[GaCl4]). Comprehensive DFT calculations have been conducted to elucidate the bonding situation in 26[GaCl4], uncovering significant metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation and a distinctive 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron hyperbonding phenomenon in the P&#8323;Pd framework. These findings offer valuable insights into chemistry of cyclic polyphosphorus compounds and, in particular, the reactivity, structural flexibility, and the coordination properties of cationic triphosphorus species.

         <title>DNA Tetrahedron&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Hairpin Assembly for in Situ Monitoring of Viral RNA in Host Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional system based on tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDN) for detecting and monitoring the release and replication of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genomic RNA in host cells. The system responds to the presence of viral RNA, utilizing a highly efficient TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly to produce specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals corresponding to the level of the target viral RNA.








Abstract
Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio&#8208;economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive, and specific in situ virus&#8208;detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)&#8208;based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV&#8208;RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV&#8208;RNA within 12 minutes in a cell&#8208;free environment, enabling real&#8208;time imaging of JEV&#8208;RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN&#8208;based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.

         <title>Secondary Donor Engineering for High&#8208;Efficiency Orange&#8208;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>

Secondary donor positional engineering at the C2 and C3 positions of a NAI&#8211;DMAc core yields efficient orange&#8209;red TADF emitters. The C3&#8209;isomer ND37DBT exhibits enhanced spin orbit coupling and RISC processes, achieving 70% PLQY. and 22.1% EQE in solution&#8209;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).








Abstract
Achieving efficient orange&#8208;red emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains challenging due to the hard to achieve great balance between a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and high radiative decay rates. In this study, a modification site engineering strategy for secondary donors to optimize excited&#8208;state properties for orange&#8208;red emitters is proposed. Two isomeric emitters, ND28DBT and ND37DBT, were synthesized by introducing dibenzothiophene (DBT) units at different positions of a naphthalimide&#8211;dimethylacridine (NAI&#8211;DMAc) core. The theoretical analysis indicates that ND37DBT possesses a more favorable excited&#8208;state configuration, which facilitates an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and accelerates the radiative decay rate. As a result, ND37DBT showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (70%), a fast RISC rate (6.25&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1), and an excellent external quantum efficiency (EQE) (22.1%) with minimal roll&#8208;off in 100 cd m&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that precise control of secondary donor modification sites offers a powerful molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;efficiency orange&#8208;red TADF materials.

As a result, ND37DBT showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (70%), a fast RISC rate (6.25&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and an excellent external quantum efficiency (&lt;i&gt;EQE)&lt;/i&gt; (22.1%) with minimal roll-off in 100 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work demonstrates that precise control of secondary donor modification sites offers a powerful molecular design strategy for developing high-efficiency orange-red TADF materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycans and Chirality: Stereoselectivity at the Core of DC&#8208;SIGN's Recognition. A Novel View of the Optimum Minimal Ligand Epitope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Focused on DC&#8208;SIGN&#8211;glycan recognition, two diverse monosaccharide scaffolds, D&#8208;Man (D&#8208;Rha) and L&#8208;Gal (L&#8208;Fuc), maintain the exquisite stereochemistry encoded in the minimal binding epitope. Decoration of this framework could guide developments of glycomimetics basased DC&#8208;SIGN binders.








Abstract
Glycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror&#8208;image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin&#8211;glycan recognition, using the well&#8208;characterized human C&#8208;type lectin Dendritic cell&#8208;specific ICAM&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing nonintegrin (DC&#8208;SIGN) as a model. By combining experimental (STD&#8208;NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC&#8208;SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2&#8314;&#8208;coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L&#8208;fucose and D&#8208;mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC&#8208;SIGN also binds &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose, and myo&#8208;inositol. Among these, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;D&#8208;mannose, while &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose binds more strongly than D&#8208;rhamnose and myo&#8208;inositol, although with lower affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;L&#8208;fucose. STD&#8208;NMR experiments confirmed that all these ligands share the same core binding epitope.

         <title>Divergent Responses of Carbon Nitride Dot&#8208;Based Amorphous Species and Small Molecule Hybrids to Trace Level Analytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>

This study presents a bottom&#8208;up synthesis method using hydrothermal reaction of CA and U to produce CNDs with controllable properties. The approach yields two distinct fractions: polycrystalline small&#8208;molecule hybrids and amorphous CNDs. The research investigates how these different species affect explosive detection capabilities, providing insights for optimizing sensing applications through controlled synthesis conditions.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nitride dots (CNDs) offers a versatile platform for the creation of diverse nanomaterials with tunable properties. Here, we report a facile hydrothermal approach using citric acid (CA) and urea (U) as precursors to synthesize CNDs with varying degrees of condensation and crystallinity. By carefully controlling reaction conditions and post&#8208;synthetic treatments, we obtained two distinct fractions: a polycrystalline fraction composed of small&#8208;molecule hybrids and an amorphous fraction containing CNDs. We then sought to understand how the dominant species in these fractions impact sensing abilities using trace&#8208;level explosive exemplars. The results have important implications for sensing and related applications where understanding the complex interplay between synthetic conditions and post&#8208;synthetic processing play vital roles in determining the final properties of CND materials.

         <title>Intramolecular PCET of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids: Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl Ketones via Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids have conventionally served as simple building blocks for the generation of nucleophilic acyl radicals. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct approach for this substrate class, showcasing the generation of ketyl radicals through a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. Coupled with aryl olefins, this approach allows for the generation of butyrolactones, a functional intermediate for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones (TFMKs), in a net dicarbofunctionalization of aryl olefins.









Abstract
Due to favourable pharmacological properties, the introduction of the fluorine atom into small molecules has become increasingly more common over the past few decades. In particular, the trifluoromethyl ketone group is of great interest due to its role as a carboxylic acid bioisostere. Recently, these fragments have been accessed via acyl radical equivalents. Herein, we disclose an unconventional intramolecular proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer activation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids by photoredox catalysis to generate ketyl radicals toward accessing functionalizable lactones. These lactones serve as synthons for modular one&#8208;pot syntheses of trifluoromethyl ketones in a net dicarbofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich olefins.

         <title>Dinuclear Copper Complex with a Pyridazine&#8208;Bridged Octadentate Ligand: Monooxygenase Activity and Characterization of Copper&#8208;Oxygen Intermediates</title>

Access to various copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates: Depending on the reaction conditions, different copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates can be obtained with our new dinuclear complex. Whereas low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1 hydroperoxo complex, oxygenation at room temperature generates a &#8220;green species&#8221; that looks like a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo complex but rather corresponds to a dihydroxo complex. The reactivities of all of these intermediates as well as the &#956;&#8208;hydroxo complex toward hydrocarbons are investigated.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the mono&#8208;oxygenation of aromatic and aliphatic substrates in nature. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a new dinuclear copper complex supported by an octadentate ligand with a pyridazine backbone. Low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OOH) complex, which in turn stoichiometrically converts anthrone (AT) to anthraquinone (AQ). Oxygenation at room temperature, by contrast, leads to a new species that mediates the conversion of AT to AQ in a catalytic fashion, but neither corresponds to a &#956;&#8208;peroxo nor a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper complex. For further analysis, a &#956;&#8208;hydroxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OH) complex is synthesized by oxidation of the copper(I) complex with AgOTf. The electronic and geometric structures of the Cu2OOH and Cu2OH intermediates, as well as the structure of the room&#8208;temperature oxygenation product are elucidated by UV/Vis, Raman, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and mass spectrometry, coupled to DFT.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Complementarity Approach to Inducing Short Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) Contacts in Tetracyanoaurate(III) Salts</title>

In a series of tetracyanoaurate(III) salts, careful consideration of cation shape &#8212; with the goal of shape&#8208;complementary crystal packing &#8212; can allow for the assembly of [Au(CN)4]&#8722; anions to be controlled, and in some cases Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) aurophilic interactions to be rationally accessed.








Abstract
Six sets of tetracyanoaurate(III) salts were synthesized and structurally characterized using the metal&#8208;ligand complex cations [RE(bipyO2)4]3+ (RE&#160;=&#160;Sc, Y, La; bipyO2&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide), [Fe(bipyO2)3]3+, [Ln(dmbipyO2)4]3+ (Ln&#160;=&#160;Ce, Eu, Yb; dmbipyO2&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide), [Ca(tcmc)]2+ (tcmc&#160;=&#160;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(carbamoylmethyl)&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane), and [Ca(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2]2+. Noncovalent assembly of the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; anions tended to occur via Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Ncyano interactions; however, rare Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) contacts between the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; groups &#8212; suggesting aurophilicity &#8212; could be induced when certain cation shape requirements were met. Specifically, cations with shape, size, and symmetry that allowed for packing in a complementary fashion with Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) aligned [Au(CN)4]&#8722; dimers or trimers &#8212; providing efficiently close&#8208;packed layers &#8212; were found to be sufficient for manifesting Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) contacts. Modifying the [RE(bipyO2)4]3+ cation with peripheral methyl groups (the [Ln(dmbipyO2)4]3+ cation) caused isoreticular replacement of a {[Au(CN)4]3}3&#8722; trimer with a dumbbell&#8208;shaped {[Au(CN)4]2Cl}3&#8722; tri&#8208;anion featuring an unusual Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Au bridge &#8212; illustrating that the assembly of the anionic groups will adapt to conserve the same close packing. Au(III) aurophilicity between the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; groups was studied using computational methods, crystal packing of the structures was probed using Hirshfeld surface analysis, and the emission properties of compounds containing the [Eu(dmbipyO2)4]3+ luminophore were investigated, showing high quantum yields of ca. 50%.

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag Ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 37, July 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise clusterization reactions of the (SP&#8208;4&#8208;3) and (SP&#8208;4&#8208;4) Pt complexes with Ag ions are reported. The small structural difference between the two types of Pt complexes was amplified by the hierarchical assembly process, producing different types of &#8220;cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster&#8221; aggregates in the crystalline state. The cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes exhibited photoluminescence corresponding to the interaction between the Pt2Ag3 unit and Ag ions, whereas each molecular component had similar photophysical properties.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexity and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt&#8208;Ag cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes. This study proves that the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in molecular systems, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potential&#8208;Enabled Discovery of Chlorofullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work introduces a DFT&#8208;accurate machine learning potential for the C&#8211;Cl system, enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP accurately reproduces various experimentally known chlorofullerenes and uncovers structural and stability correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives, offering theoretical insights into chlorofullerene formation.








Abstract
Chlorination is an effective method for stabilizing fullerenes with pentagon adjacencies, transforming reactive sp2 carbon sites into sp3 hybridization to release local strain and reorganize orbital and spin distributions. Yet, the immense variety of fullerene isomers and their diverse chlorination sites pose significant challenges for accurate structural prediction. This study introduces a density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;accurate machine learning potential (MLP) for the C&#8208;Cl system, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP precisely replicates a range of experimentally identified chlorofullerenes and establishes correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives in terms of structural features and stability, offering theoretical insights into the formation principles of chlorofullerenes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a pivotal role in energy and environmental applications, but its industrial synthesis remains hampered by high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and safety risks. Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable alternative by leveraging solar energy to catalyze H2O2 production from oxygen and water. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their well&#8208;defined structures and customizable active sites, enabling efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. This review comprehensively explores recent progress in COF&#8208;mediated photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. It begins with an overview of photocatalytic principles, followed by a detailed analysis of reaction mechanisms and performance metrics for H2O2 generation. Emphasis is placed on tailored COF design strategies&#8212;such as electronic structure optimization and redox&#8208;active site engineering&#8212;to improve catalytic efficiency. Finally, we identify key challenges hindering the development of high&#8208;performance COFs photocatalysts tailored for sustainable H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Fuel&#8208;Driven Networked Catalytic Machinery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a pivotal advancement in networked molecular machinery by integrating chemical&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven communication and catalysis. When the self&#8208;sorted system of a zinc hexacyclen, a silver(I)&#8208;loaded receptor and a [2]rotaxane (= NetState&#8208;I) was exposed to 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as chemical fuel, the protonation first entailed a translocation of Zn2+ onto the receptor and, concomitantly, of silver(I) onto the [2]rotaxane, a cascade process that gradually reversed to the initial state. In the initial networked state, the silver(I) ions were tightly captured inside the receptor so that their catalytic activity was zero, while the transiently generated silver(I) [2]rotaxane (k298 = 176 kHz) catalyzed the 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldoxime. The pulsed operation of this networked catalytic machinery, driven by chemical fuel, presents a novel paradigm for cascaded signaling and time&#8208;programmed catalysis, mimicking the complexity of biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Radical Polar Crossover Route to 1,4&#8208;Keto Carboxylates Mediated by Anchimeric Assistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we developed an electrochemical method for 1,4&#8208;dioxygenated compounds, offering broad scope, functional group compatibility, and diastereoselectivity.








Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylate scaffold is present in the structure of many biologically relevant compounds. To date, there are only a branch of methods to prepare them, using either transition metal catalysts, or noncommercially available and sensitive starting materials. Herein, we describe a sustainable electrochemical methodology starting from commercially available and highly stable 1,3&#8208;diketones and alkenes to prepare 1,4&#8208;keto aryl and alkyl carboxylates in a highly efficient manner, without the need of an external catalyst or harsh reaction conditions. This electrochemical oxidative radical polar crossover transformation presents a broad scope, is compatible with many functional groups, and can even be applied in flow chemistry. In addition, the key stabilization of the intermediate carbocation by anchimeric assistance allows a high diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control of the reaction. Moreover, the utility of these 1,4&#8208;keto carboxylates was demonstrated in several derivatizations and applications in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Aggregation Mechanisms, and Morphological Properties of Asymmetric Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric PDI derivatives, bearing similar OEG chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate changes in hydrophobicity on the properties of the resulting SMPs in solvent mixtures. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with increasing hydrophobicity. Tuning molecular structure leads to tuneable self&#8208;assembled structures and mechanisms of assembly.








Abstract
The ability to control the self&#8208;assembly behavior of functional molecules offers pathways for optimizing their properties and structures for targeted applications. Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self&#8208;assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self&#8208;assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber&#8208;based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self&#8208;assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.

         <title>Unraveling Structural Evolution of Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied for various complex electrocatalytic reactions, such as nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia. Currently, their real active sites are controversial due to the inevitable structure transformations of MOFs during the catalytic process, limiting the rational design of effective electrocatalysts. Here, we clarified the structural evolution of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF&#8208;67) with Co&#8208;N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co&#8208;HHTP) with Co&#8208;O units on carbon paper (CP) toward enhancing NO3RR. Both ZIF&#8208;67/CP and Co&#8208;HHTP/CP achieve NH3 Faradaic efficiencies more than 95% within the wide potential range of &#8208;0.2 to &#8208;1.0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). At &#8208;1.0 V vs. RHE, they deliver NH3 yield rates of 87.41 and 79.11 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, respectively, which outperform the most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Combining with in&#8208;situ Raman and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we verified the faster transformation of ZIF&#8208;67 into Co(OH)2 compared to Co&#8208;HHTP. The newly generated Co(OH)2 was recognized as the catalytic species and presents more favorable hydrogenation as elucidated by in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy. This work offers insightful understanding on the active phase of MOFs for designing reasonable active units toward different electrochemial reactions.</dc:description>

Currently, their real active sites are controversial due to the inevitable structure transformations of MOFs during the catalytic process, limiting the rational design of effective electrocatalysts. Here, we clarified the structural evolution of zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-67) with Co-N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co-HHTP) with Co-O units on carbon paper (CP) toward enhancing NO3RR. Both ZIF-67/CP and Co-HHTP/CP achieve NH3 Faradaic efficiencies more than 95% within the wide potential range of -0.2 to -1.0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). At -1.0 V vs. RHE, they deliver NH3 yield rates of 87.41 and 79.11 mg h-1 cm-2, respectively, which outperform the most reported MOF-based electrocatalysts. Combining with in-situ Raman and ex-situ X-ray diffraction analysis, we verified the faster transformation of ZIF-67 into Co(OH)2 compared to Co-HHTP.

         <title>Vacuum Condensation of Hybrid Polymeric Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Extended Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) has attracted considerable attention as a promising photocatalyst, however, its practical application is still hindered by the poor visible&#8208;light absorption and rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Herein, we report a vacuum&#8208;condensation approach for synthesizing g&#8208;CN with a hybrid polymeric structure that containing melon&#8208;type chains combined with completely condensed domains, which induces a notable structural disorder with the N/C atomic ratio less than 1.5 (the nominal value of melon). This hybrid polymeric structure intrinsically extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the heptazine&#8208;based framework, narrows its band gap, accelerates the exciton dissociation, and thus substantially improves its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Compared to the counterparts synthesized under inert atmospheres (N2 and Ar), the vacumm&#8208;polycondensed g&#8208;CN exhibits a 3&#8208;fold enhancement for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. In particularly, its PHE activity can be effectively maintained under the light wavelength extended to 520 nm. This work presents a promising strategy to break through the limitation of linear polymerization pathway during the conventional g&#8208;CN synthesis, and offers new opportunities for rational design of more efficient g&#8208;CN&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Multifunctionality, Catalytic Mechanisms, and In&#8208;situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as polysulfide shuttle, sluggish redox kinetics, and electrode instability hinder their practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring high porosity, tunable functionality, and structural regularity, have emerged as versatile materials to address these issues. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in COF&#8208;based strategies for LSBs, including their multifunctional roles as sulfur hosts, separators/interlayers, and catalytic additives. The predominant catalytic mechanisms associated with COFs are further elucidated, with specific focus being placed on electrostatic field catalysis, supramolecular channel catalysis, redox&#8208;mediated catalysis, and metal&#8208;coordination catalysis. While conventional characterization techniques have been extensively described in previous reviews, particular emphasis is placed on the application of in&#8208;situ characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, which offer mechanistic insights into COF&#8208;catalyzed polysulfide conversion. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8211;function&#8211;performance relationship of COFs and guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation COF&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;performance LSBs.</dc:description>

This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8211;function&#8211;performance relationship of COFs and guide the rational design of next-generation COF-based materials for high-performance LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen for Targeted Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ApApt is a light&#8208;up probe designed for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer cells. It combines AIEgen with the aptamer SYL3C to specifically target EpCAM&#8208;positive cancer cells. Upon aptamer&#8208;EpCAM binding, ApApt emits strong fluorescence due to the restricted intramolecular motion of AIEgens. This activation enables efficient ROS generation for targeted PDT under light irradiation, offering a precise approach for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising noninvasive treatment for cancer and other diseases. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers are excellent candidates for enhancing the efficacy of image&#8208;guided PDT due to their unique properties. DNA&#8208;modified AIE luminogens (AIEgens) offer an effective approach for nucleic acid detection and biospecies sensing, but their applications in tumor cell imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT have been rarely reported. Herein, we designed a light&#8208;up probe, named ApApt, for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT of cancer cells. The probe was prepared by conjugating AIEgen with aptamer and displayed specific targeting ability to EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)&#8208;positive cancer cells. ApApt exhibits good water solubility and shows very low emission in aqueous solution. However, it emits strong fluorescence as a result of the restricted intramolecular motion (RIM) activation of AIEgens, which is triggered by the specific binding between the aptamer SYL3C and EpCAM protein. Upon delivery to cancer cells, ApApt efficiently generates ROS for targeted PDT under light irradiation.

         <title>Coverage&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Rates of Metalation, Ring Fusion, and Polymerization of Benzoporphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, supported by scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density&#8208;functional theory, we have investigated metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins on Cu(111). We furthermore compare our results with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin on Cu(111).








Abstract
Using scanning&#8208;tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), we have investigated metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins, tetraphenyltransdisbenzoporphyrin (2&#8208;Benzo), copper&#8208;tetraphenyltransdibenzoporphyrin (Cu 2&#8208;Benzo), and tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (4&#8208;Benzo), from 280 to 1000&#160;K on Cu(111), and compare with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin (0&#8208;Benzo) on Cu(111).Using STM, we observe 2&#8208;Benzo to adsorb as individual, rather&#8208;immobile molecules at room temperature, which coalesce into elongated islands of metalated molecules at 373&#160;K. N&#160;1&#160;s XPS spectra confirm the metalation, and DFT&#8208;calculated structures and simulated STM images confirm the appearance in STM. Upon further heating to 398&#160;K, the islands become rough and irregularly shaped, before completely breaking up at 423&#160;K, most likely related to intramolecular ring fusion. Heating to 950&#160;K leads to complete polymerization and a rough structure on the surface.Using H2 TPD, we follow the coverage&#8208;dependent rates of metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization for all four molecules. The metalation rate is found to correlate with, sometimes abrupt, changes in the adsorption structures, whereas the rates of ring fusion and polymerization decrease gradually with increasing coverage, for all molecules.

         <title>Strong Magnetic Coupling and Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Behavior in Tetrazinyl Radical&#8208;Bridged Metallocenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine with Ln metallocenes led to the isolation of two new radical&#8208;bridged dinuclear complexes. Strong magnetic Ln&#8211;rad coupling was observed, which afforded zero&#8208;field SMM behavior for the Dy analogue.








Abstract
Exchange coupling is essential in defining the magnetic behavior of polymetallic lanthanide&#8208;based (LnIII) single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), where, thanks to the unpaired electron(s), radical ligands show promise as magnetic bridges between the paramagnetic metal centers. Combining high&#8208;performance lanthanide metallocene [Cp*&#8322;Ln]+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) units with the 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine radical ligand (bmtz&#8226;&#8722;) yielded two new radical&#8208;bridged dinuclear lanthanide metallocenes, [(Cp*&#8322;Ln)&#8322;(bmtz&#8226;&#8722;)](BPh4)&#183;Solvent (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd (1), Solvent&#160;=&#160;THF; Dy (2), Solvent&#160;=&#160;toluene). The strong magnetic exchange coupling of JGd&#8211;rad = &#8208;12.6 cm&#8722;1 observed in 1, was probed via SQUID magnetometry as well as computational studies. This, combined with the highly anisotropic DyIII ions in 2, leads to zero&#8208;field SMM behavior and slow magnetic relaxation through thermally activated processes.

         <title>Fluorinated Phenylazopyrazoles for Monitoring the Photoisomerization in Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitches have been impacting diverse areas of research, introducing means of dynamically regulating their environment through reversible photochemical isomerization. Among the different classes of photoswitches, phenylazopyrazoles (PAPs) stand out due to their facile synthesis, beneficial photochemical properties, and the long thermal stability of their metastable forms. Not surprisingly, they have been applied in different fields, from material sciences to pharmacology. However, once incorporated into complex systems, following the photoisomerization behavior of PAPs with routinely used analytical methods becomes challenging. In this work, we focused on synthesizing and studying the isomerization behaviour of a series of differently substituted PAPs possessing two trifluoromethyl groups on the pyrazole moiety (F&#8208;PAPs). By studying their isomerization with steady&#8208;state and transient absorption spectroscopy, we found marked trends in the isomerization efficiency and photophysical properties of the different switches. Most importantly, these molecules can quantitatively isomerize between their stable and metastable form, with relatively long lifetimes of thermal back relaxation. Leveraging these characteristics, we highlight in this work the potential application of F&#8208;PAPs as photoswitchable 19F&#8208;NMR probes to generate light&#8208;responsive vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Deoxygenation of Alcohols by Using Hydrosilanes as Reductants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for selective C&#9472;O bond cleavage using Sc(OTf)&#8323; as the catalyst in the presence of hydrosilanes as reductants is reported. Alcohols, ketones, and alkyl halides were efficiently reduced to the corresponding alkanes, with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.








Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient scandium&#8208;based catalytic system that enables highly selective reduction of &#963; bonds (C&#9472;O) in the presence of more reactive &#960; (C&#9552;O) or O&#9472;H bonds. Employing 5&#160;mol% of Sc(OTf)3 as the catalyst, a diverse range of aryl and alkyl hydrosilanes proved to be highly effective in reducing secondary and tertiary alcohols to the corresponding alkanes. Furthermore, this protocol was extended to the deoxygenation of ketones and the hydrodehalogenation of alkyl halides.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient scandium-based catalytic system that enables highly selective reduction of &#963; bonds (C&#9472;O) in the presence of more reactive &#960; (C&#9552;O) or O&#9472;H bonds. Employing 5&#160;mol% of Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the catalyst, a diverse range of aryl and alkyl hydrosilanes proved to be highly effective in reducing secondary and tertiary alcohols to the corresponding alkanes. Furthermore, this protocol was extended to the deoxygenation of ketones and the hydrodehalogenation of alkyl halides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Reduction of Propargyl Alcohols for the Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Diarylallenes Under N,N&#8208;Ligand and Hydride&#8208;free Conditions</title>

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed photoredox strategy has been developed to provide an alternative and efficient approach for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diarylallenes from propargyl alcohols under N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;and hydride&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
Allenes are a class of important organic compounds, and their synthesis has always been of great interest. In this article, we have developed a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed photoredox strategy, providing an alternative and efficient approach for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diarylallenes from propargyl alcohols. The reaction utilized organic amines as a hydrogen source to avoid the use of conventional hydride additives and does not require the addition of extra N,N&#8208;ligands to activate the cobalt catalyst, achieving a mild reaction condition. As a result, the reaction was able to synthesize the desired 1,3&#8208;diarylallene compounds with good yields and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and 199Hg Chemical Shifts of Mercury 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene (MesDPM) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations for the Hg(I) 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene complex, [(MesDPM)Hg]2, predict a 199Hg chemical shift of &#8722;648&#160;ppm. The experimental 199Hg NMR spectrum features a singlet close to the predicted shift, at &#8722;772&#160;ppm, demonstrating the utility of DFT for the characterization of Hg coordination complexes.








Abstract
In this work, we describe the easy synthesis of mercury complexes with the 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene (MesDPM) ligand. The compounds were characterized using standard analytic methods such as NMR, IR, as well as UV/Vis spectroscopy. The molecular structures in solid state were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments. In addition, the 199Hg NMR chemical shifts were determined by measurements and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>High Dispersion of Copper Nanoparticles on Carbon Black in Minimal Loadings Enhances the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A few copper nanoparticles (less than 1&#160;mg/cm2) supported on CB and deposited on a carbon&#8208;based GDL can achieve Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 60% for CO formation at 100&#160;mA/cm2 due to their homogeneous dispersion and separated catalytic sites.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO&#8322; reduction (ECR) offers a promising route for converting CO&#8322; emissions into valuable chemicals. To enhance economic viability, the development of efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts based on nonnoble metals is crucial. This study focuses on copper (Cu) nanoparticles highly dispersed on a carbon black (CB) support, synthesized via a solvothermal method that allows for precise control over particle size and loading. We demonstrate that tuning these properties is essential to steer the selectivity of CO&#8322; reduction toward carbon monoxide (CO). Notably, a low catalyst loading of only 0.159&#160;mg/cm2 was sufficient to achieve high performance. The optimized catalyst delivered a CO partial current density of 66&#160;mA/cm2 (total current density of 100&#160;mA/cm2 with 66% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO) at a cell voltage of 3.2&#160;V. Furthermore, our results highlight the critical role of the gas diffusion layer (GDL), showing that its composition significantly impacts catalyst activity. This underscores the necessity of engineering advanced GDLs with tailored conductivity, stability, and hydrophobicity to further boost the performance of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CO&#8322; electrolysis.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Conversion of Bisphenol A Polycarbonate into Aliphatic Polycarbonate Polyols for Recyclable Polyurethane Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step synthesis of aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) polyols via upcycling of bisphenol&#8208;A based polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) is shown. These APC polyols were further utilized to produce thermoplastic polyurethanes that exhibit excellent chemical recyclability, enabling the simultaneous hydrolysis of both carbonate and urethane bonds.








Abstract
The growing accumulation of plastic waste emphasizes the pressing need for sustainable recycling technologies. In this study, we present a one&#8208;step conversion of bisphenol A&#8208; based polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) waste into aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) polyols using diols with varying chain lengths. The resulting APC polyols were subsequently utilized as soft segments in combination with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) in the production of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). These TPUs exhibited excellent mechanical properties, with a maximum tensile strength of 58&#160;MPa and elongation at break of 397%, as well as robust hydrolytic stability, maintaining performance even after prolonged water exposure. Notably, the APC&#8208;based TPUs exhibited excellent recyclability through organocatalytic depolymerization, which facilitated the simultaneous hydrolysis of both urethane and carbonate bonds. This process yielded the selective formation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA), an industrial precursor to MDI, and 1,4&#8208;butanediol (1,4&#8208;BD) with remarkably high yields of 96% and 95%, respectively. This work provides valuable insights into designing closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers by upcycling plastic waste via a straightforward process. Additionally, it offers a practical and impactful solution for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life management of upcycled polyurethane products, thereby contributing to a circular plastic economy.

         <title>Redox cycling at tellurium: Selective and multiple activation of Si&#8211;H bonds in common organosilanes and SiH4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox catalysis involving the tellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] was utilized for the activation of the common silanes Et3SiH, Ph4&#8211;nSiHn (n = 1 &#8211; 3) as well as the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle gaseous SiH4. Furthermore, complex siloxanes containing multiple Si&#8722;H bonds were converted into siloxylated phenols which are of high interest for the chemical industry. Insights into the catalytical cycle utilizing para&#8208;quinones as both, oxidants and substrates, were provided by identification of key intermediates and by using in situ time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations. Based on this study, the catalytic cycle is initiated by a Si&#8211;H bond activation resulting in the formation of a ditelluride species and the corresponding silyl triflate. In turn, the ditelluride species is first oxidized by the presented quinone, forming an unprecedented tellurium&#8208;based oxonium intermediate, resulting in the formation of the siloxylated phenols and liberation the tellurium catalyst upon subsequent reaction with the silyl triflate. Our proposed catalytic cycle can be generalized for any silane used in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Insights into Direct Electron Transfer Between FDX1 and Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ Complex in Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) evidence uncovers direct ET (electron transfer) and high specificity between FDX1 (ferredoxin 1) and the ES&#8208;Cu2+ (Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+) complex.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;induced cell death, known as cuproptosis, is distinct from other forms of cell death processes. Previous studies have proposed Elesclomol (ES) as a potent cuproptosis inducer, with the mitochondrial ferredoxin protein FDX1 postulated as its primary target. However, the mechanistic details of electron transfer (ET) between Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ (ES&#8208;Cu2+) and FDX1 remain elusive, particularly lacking direct spectroscopic evidence. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to characterize the direct ET process between FDX1 and ES&#8208;Cu2+ complexes. Comprehensive low&#8208;temperature EPR measurements validated the efficient ET from reduced FDX1 (FDX1red) to oxidized ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex exhibited a greater propensity for accepting electrons from FDX1 compared to free copper ions (Cu2+), demonstrating the high efficiency of ES&#8208;Cu2+ as a primary electron scavenger for FDX1 in cells. In addition, EPR power saturation experiments and molecular docking analysis indicated that FDX1 has a much higher binding affinity for ES&#8208;Cu2+ than its homologue FDX2, providing crucial insights into the functional specificity between FDX1 and FDX2. This work advances our understanding of ET processes in cuproptosis and underscores the significant potential of EPR spectroscopy in the study of important redox events in cells.

         <title>Investigating the Site&#8208;Specific Impact of Fluorine Substitution on Aromatic Interactions in a Tryptophan Zipper Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constitutional isomers of fluoro&#8208;tryptophan alter the stability of the &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide Trpzip2 by tuning key CH/&#960; and NH/&#960; interactions.








Abstract
The stability of pairwise tryptophan (Trp) edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions has been exploited in the design of small tryptophan zipper (Trpzip) peptides. Herein, we report a systematic study of the regiospecific impact of four constitutional isomers of non&#8208;natural fluoro&#8208;Trp, regarding their incorporation at either edge&#8208; or face&#8208;positions. Single fluorine substituents affect the electron density of the indole moiety and introduce a highly electronegative component while the native geometry of Trp is maintained. We employed a library approach based on the sequence of Trpzip2 and assessed peptide structure and stability using CD, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy. Global hairpin stability was improved or compromised upon site&#8208;specific incorporation of a single monofluoro&#8208;Trp regioisomer. Fluorine substitution revealed key CH/&#960; interactions within the Trp/Trp packing and holds potential for the future optimization of aromatic interactions involving Trp.

         <title>A Dilute Hybrid Electrolyte With Trimethylolpropane Additive for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated at Low Temperature</title>

A water/trimethylolpropane (TMP) hybrid electrolyte with expanded ESW and lowered freezing point is designed for ASIBs. An ESW of 2.85&#160;V and a freezing point below &#8208;80 &#176;C are realized, benefiting from the reconstruction of hydrogen bonds due to the introduction of TMP molecules. Equipped with this hybrid electrolyte, the full cells display a specific capacity of 56.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 88% capacity retention after 800 cycles. Even at low temperatures of &#8208;20 &#176;C, a specific capacity of 50.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles is also achieved.








Abstract
Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) have attracted significant attention due to the advantages of high safety and low cost for energy storage devices. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes and freezing at low temperatures limit practical applications. Herein, we broaden the ESW to 2.85&#160;V and reduce the freezing point (below &#8208;80 &#176;C) by using trimethylolpropane (TMP) additive to 1&#160;M NaNO3 aqueous solution. Based on this hybrid electrolyte and equipped with a bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (NaCuHCF) cathode and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode, the full cells display a specific capacity of 56.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 88% capacity retention after 800 cycles. Even at low temperatures of &#8208;20 &#176;C, a specific capacity of 50.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles is also achieved. A series of spectral tests illustrate the interaction between TMP and water molecules, which realizes the excellent electrochemical performances, especially at low temperatures. This work provides a new strategy for the application of ASIBs in extreme weather and expands the practical application of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Impact of Oxygen and Sulfur Heteroatom Core Substitution on Catalyst Properties of Phenoxazines and Their Performance in Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenoxazines are photoredox catalysts (PCs) with tunable redox and photophysical properties. Core modification with thioether or ether to a PC that exhibits photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (CT) negligibly alters the singlet excited state reduction potential (ES1&#176;*) while yielding a less oxidizing PC&#8226;+ (E1/2) (E1/2 = 0.50&#8208;0.64 V vs. SCE) compared to the non&#8208;core modified PC 1 (0.68 V vs. SCE). Photophysical characterization of HetCS PCs revealed that increasing electron density on the core of a CT exhibiting PC stabilizes the emissive state and PC&#8226;+, resulting in a relatively unchanged ES1&#176;* compared to PC 1. However, modifying the core of a PC that does not exhibit CT yields a highly reducing ES1&#176;* (PC 3 = &#8208;2.48 V vs. SCE) compared to its CT equivalent (PC 1d = &#8208;1.68 V vs. SCE). The impact of PC property on photocatalytic ability was evaluated through organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP). HetCS PCs were able to yield poly(methyl methacrylate) with low dispersity and moderate targeted molecular weight as evaluated by initiator efficiency (I*) in DMAc (&#208; = 1.20&#8208;1.26; I* = 47&#8208;57%). Ultimately, this work provides insight into how phenoxazine PC properties are altered through structural modification, which can inform future PC design.</dc:description>

         <title>Implementation of the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base Principle for the Direct Synthesis of Bimetallic Zirconium&#8208;Nickel and Hafnium&#8208;Nickel Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Polar Pore Environment</title>

         <dc:description>An important direction in MOFs is the development of materials with well&#8208;defined and ordered heterogeneity towards novel functionalities and control of important properties at the atomic scale. A great approach is the designed synthesis of mixed metal MOFs (M&#8217;MOFs) made of different building units, based on distinct metal cations. However, their in&#8208;situ formation and co&#8208;assembly into an extended crystalline framework present great challenges due to the different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We report the successful synthesis of two isostructural, bimetallic Zr&#8208;Ni and Hf&#8208;Ni M&#8217;MOFs following the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) principle. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of a 3D structure that features an in&#8208;situ formed [Ni(HPyC)4Cl2]4&#8208; 4&#8208;c non&#8208;planar metallo&#8208;ligand, that bridges 8&#8208;c Zr(Hf)6&#8208;clusters. The resulting (4, 8)&#8208;c scu type framework shows polygonal 1D channels, with a largest pore diameter of approximately 9 &#197;, decorated by Cl&#8208; anions. This polar pore environment was found fully accessible and both materials were investigated for Xe/Kr and CO2/CH4 separation. The results are very promising showing that the IAST selectivity calculated for a 20:80 Xe/Kr molar mixture is 8.2 and 7.1 at 298K for the Zr_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Hf_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, respectively, which is comparable to some of the best performing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by ligand&#8208;assisted re&#8208;precipitation approach. Incorporating ICA ligand in place of long chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of non&#8208;radiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518 nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75 &#177; 2% to 94 &#177; 2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Hydrogels with Antimicrobial or Cell Adhesive Properties for Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple strategy to generate self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based hydrogels by combining sequences that include a SaU and a bioactive motif &#8208;either cell&#8208;adhesive (RGD) or antimicrobial (LF)&#8208; with HA. The resulting systems form 3D fibrillar networks that are physicochemically characterized and exhibit selective biological functions, supporting their application in tissue engineering and the prevention of biomaterial&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Bacterial colonization on biomaterials is a major issue, leading to approximately 20% of implant failures due to infection and biofilm formation. To address this, peptide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating tailored bioactive peptides have emerged as promising candidates for applications in tissue engineering and infection control. Here, we have designed peptide sequences that incorporate i) a self&#8208;assembling unit (SaU) and ii) bioactive motifs, including the well&#8208;known arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartate (RGD) sequence to promote cell adhesion or an antimicrobial peptide derived from lactoferrin (LF) to exhibit antibacterial properties. To aid in the gelation, these peptides were combined with hyaluronic acid (HA), rendering peptide&#8208;based hydrogels without the need for additional external assembly triggers, simplifying their application in biomedical contexts. This protocol allowed for a spontaneous formation of a 3D fibrillar network, with structural and physicochemical properties suitable for tissue engineering. The biological evaluation revealed the ability of RGD&#8208;based hydrogels to increase the adhesion and spreading of osteoblastic cells compared to controls, while the LF&#8208;based hydrogels significantly reduced the viability and attachment of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains, clearly affecting bacterial morphology. This report demonstrates the feasibility of this technology to produce hydrogels incorporating distinct biological cues, highlighting their potential as versatile biomaterials to address diverse biomedical challenges.

         <title>Sustainable Approaches for the Protection and Deprotection of Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shield: Protection and deprotection are key to selective synthesis, but conventional methods can lack sustainability. This review highlights electrochemical and photochemical strategies as greener alternatives, emphasizing their mechanisms, functional group tolerance, and broad synthetic utility.








Abstract
While functional group tolerance is a critical consideration in synthetic method development, many functional groups often fail to remain intact under diverse reaction conditions. Therefore, the protection of specific functional groups and subsequent deprotection are convenient choices for the efficient and selective synthesis of target compounds, for which the strategies have been securely established. Meanwhile, the development of sustainable synthetic methods, particularly electrochemistry and photochemistry, has recently played a significant role in the field of organic synthesis, and these approaches have proven useful in the methods of functional group protection and deprotection. This review explores electrochemical and photochemical strategies for the protection and deprotection of functional groups, with a focus on their mechanistic diversity, sustainability, and synthetic utility across various functional group classes.

         <title>Synthesis of Siphonazole B Through Domino Cycloisomerization&#8208;Oxazolonium Ion Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study by Strand and co&#8208;workers describes a concise synthesis of siphonazole B. Both oxazole units are formed from a simple propargylamine using a novel domino cycloisomerization&#8208;rearrangement approach. Additional synthetic features include a direct aldol&#8208;type reaction for assembling the tricyclic siphonazole core and an oxidative amidation reaction to install the sensitive (E)&#8208;penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dieneylamide.








Abstract
4&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;acyloxazoles represent important substructures across a diverse array of bioactive molecules. Practical methods to synthesize these motifs are, therefore, of considerable interest. Here, we develop a novel domino process wherein a cycloisomerization is followed by a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement via an oxazolonium ion to yield 4&#8208;alkenyloxazoles from an abundant &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl propargylamine and acyl chlorides. The synthetic utility of the method is highlighted by its application to both oxazole units of siphonazole B, leading to a concise convergent total synthesis of this natural product.

         <title>Synthesis, Photophysical, and Chemiexcitation Properties of Luminol&#8208;Fullerene Dyads: Toward Chemiexcitation Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emission properties of fullerene&#8208;luminol dyads, following either irradiation or chemiexcitation, are evaluated. Strong luminol (chemi)luminescence quenching is partially attributed to electron transfer.








Abstract
Fullerene&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads have been extensively studied for their unique electronic properties, with applications in photoinduced energy conversion devices. In these systems, dynamic quenching of the excited donor's emission occurs, via energy or electron transfer to the fullerene acceptor. However, there are no reports on fullerene dyads bearing chemiluminescent donor analogues. In this context, the synthesis of two luminol&#8208;fullerene D&#8208;A dyads, bridged with alkyl chains of different lengths, is reported herein. The electronic communication between the two moieties was thoroughly evaluated, following either the photo&#8208; or chemi&#8208;excitation of the linked units.

     alt="Synthesis, Photophysical, and Chemiexcitation Properties of Luminol-Fullerene Dyads: Toward Chemiexcitation Electron Transfer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emission properties of fullerene-luminol dyads, following either irradiation or chemiexcitation, are evaluated. Strong luminol (chemi)luminescence quenching is partially attributed to electron transfer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fullerene-based donor-acceptor (D-A) dyads have been extensively studied for their unique electronic properties, with applications in photoinduced energy conversion devices. In these systems, dynamic quenching of the excited donor's emission occurs, via energy or electron transfer to the fullerene acceptor. However, there are no reports on fullerene dyads bearing chemiluminescent donor analogues. In this context, the synthesis of two luminol-fullerene D-A dyads, bridged with alkyl chains of different lengths, is reported herein. The electronic communication between the two moieties was thoroughly evaluated, following either the photo- or chemi-excitation of the linked units. Steady state and time-resolved absorption studies, combined with emission techniques, were employed to monitor the deactivation fate of excited species. In general, a significant quenching of the excited luminol-derived emission signals was observed, revealing detectable intramolecular interactions between the two moieties. Unlike what is usually observed in other luminol-based D-A systems, quenching of the excited species generated upon photo- and chemi-excitation of the luminol-fullerene dyads is attributed to electron rather than energy transfer. This was found to be consistent with the estimated Gibbs energy of photoinduced electron transfer and with DFT theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4) (S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Octahedral and One with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 have been obtained as blue crystals, respectively. The [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; &#8211;anions coordinate the central Pd2+ cations via oxygen atoms in octahedral fashion. With Pd2+ as d8 high&#8208;spin cations the bulk samples are paramagnetic. Furthermore, Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)] has been obtained as side product in form of red crystals. The structure exhibits chain&#8208;like borosulfate anions and Pd2+ cations in square planar coordination.








Abstract
The reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3 at elevated temperature results in the formation of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the compound crystallizes in two different polymorphs obtained as bulk samples. In both structures the Pd2+ cations are coordinated by six oxygen atoms in form of an almost perfect octahedron. All oxygen atoms belong to the borosulfate anions [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; and link via Pd2+ cations to an extended network structure. Within the uncommon octahedral oxygen coordination, the Pd2+ cations reveal a d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to paramagnetism. Occasionally, red crystals are formed during the reaction next to the major fraction of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2 with Pd2+ in square&#8208;planar coordination.

         <title>Ring Contraction of Cyclooctatetraenes toward Non&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Au(111)&#8208;Catalysis and Bulk Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au(111)&#8208;catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of tetraphenylated DA&#8208;COT and TA&#8208;COT is compared with bulk pyrolysis. On Au(111), a strain&#8208;induced contraction of the central COT unit toward six&#8208;membered rings occurs. For TA&#8208;COT, a rearrangement toward a non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings is observed as an alternative reaction product. Uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis only gives the ring contraction product for both COT derivatives.








Abstract
The Au(111)&#8208;catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of tetraphenylated diacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (DA&#8208;COT) and tetraacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (TA&#8208;COT) was investigated and compared with their uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis. On Au(111), a strain&#8208;induced contraction of the central COT unit toward six&#8208;membered rings upon extrusion of alkynes occurred. For TA&#8208;COT, an alternative reaction pathway opened up due to the increased ring strain of the eliminated alkyne product. This pathway involved a rearrangement toward a non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing a sesquifulvalene core. Intermediates and (by&#8208;)products were observed by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), verifying the predicted reaction mechanism. Formation of [8]circulene derivatives was not observed. Uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis only gave one ring contraction product, respectively, for both COT derivatives.

         <title>What Can be Learned From the Electrostatic Environments Within Nitrogenase Enzymes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic M&#8208;clusters of nitrogenase enzymes exhibit characteristic electrostatic patterns around the sites involved in N2 fixation. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site is consistently identified, as well as a minor field pointing toward the Fe6 sites. Furthermore, a significant long&#8208;range field along the Fe2&#8211;Fe6 axis is computed. These patterns may significantly impact the chemical reactivity of these clusters.








Abstract
Nitrogen fixation is a fundamental, and yet challenging, chemical transformation due to the intrinsic inertness of dinitrogen. Whereas industrial ammonia synthesis relies on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process, nitrogenase enzymes achieve this transformation under ambient conditions&#8212;yet at the expense of a remarkably high ATP demand. Understanding their mode of operation could inspire the development of more efficient synthetic catalysts. In this study, we scrutinize the electrostatic environment surrounding nitrogenase's active site, the so&#8208;called M&#8208;cluster. Strikingly, we observe that all types of M&#8208;clusters exhibit similar trends, with distinct patterns around the individual metal sites that have been proposed as potential N2&#8208;coordination sites. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site is identified, as well as a minor field pointing toward the Fe6 sites. Furthermore, a significant oriented long&#8208;range field along the Fe2&#8211;Fe6 axis is computed across the entire family of nitrogenases. In the final part of the manuscript, we discuss how the observed electrostatic patterns may impact chemical reactivity, and how they can be connected to previously made mechanistic hypotheses. Overall, this study provides further evidence for the ubiquitousness of local electric fields in enzyme catalysis, even when substrates that seemingly have only limited electrostatic susceptibility are involved.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement Mechanisms of Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage in Black Phosphorus@Ti3C2Tx (BP@Ti3C2Tx) Composite Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes</title>

A binder&#8208;free BP@Ti3C2Tx composite film electrode was prepared by vacuum filtration. Ti3C2Tx MXene forms a 3D conductive network and Ti&#9472;O&#9472;P bonds, inhibits the volume expansion of BP, achieves high capacity (685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 a /g) and excellent stability.








Abstract
A binder&#8208;free BP@Ti3C2Tx composite thin&#8208;film electrode was fabricated via a one&#8208;step vacuum filtration method, enabling precise control over morphology and scalability. The Ti3C2Tx MXene framework constructs a 3D conductive network that enhances charge transfer kinetics and mechanically confines black phosphorus (BP) particles through robust Ti&#9472;O&#9472;P bonding, effectively suppressing BP's volume expansion during cycling. Structural characterization (XRD, SEM, EDS, etc.) confirms the homogeneous &#8220;Mosaic&#8221; architecture, with BP particles uniformly embedded in the MXene matrix. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further reveals enhanced Ti&#9472;C bonding and significant Ti&#8208;O&#8208;P interfacial interactions. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance: the composite electrode achieves a discharge capacity of 685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles, near&#8208;100% Coulombic efficiency, and remarkable capacity recovery (783.21 mAh/g) after high&#8208;rate cycling (1.5 A/g). Kinetic analysis via cyclic voltammetry further indicates a reduced polarization (&#916;V&#160;=&#160;0.06&#160;V) and enhanced capacitive contribution (b&#8208;value&#160;=&#160;0.663&#8211;0.799), attributed to MXene's dual role in facilitating ion diffusion and electron transport. This work provides a scalable, binder&#8208;free electrode design strategy, offering fundamental insights into MXene&#8208;phosphorus synergism for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A binder-free BP@Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; composite thin-film electrode was fabricated via a one-step vacuum filtration method, enabling precise control over morphology and scalability. The Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MXene framework constructs a 3D conductive network that enhances charge transfer kinetics and mechanically confines black phosphorus (BP) particles through robust Ti&#9472;O&#9472;P bonding, effectively suppressing BP's volume expansion during cycling. Structural characterization (XRD, SEM, EDS, etc.) confirms the homogeneous &#8220;Mosaic&#8221; architecture, with BP particles uniformly embedded in the MXene matrix. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further reveals enhanced Ti&#9472;C bonding and significant Ti-O-P interfacial interactions. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance: the composite electrode achieves a discharge capacity of 685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles, near-100% Coulombic efficiency, and remarkable capacity recovery (783.21 mAh/g) after high-rate cycling (1.5 A/g). Kinetic analysis via cyclic voltammetry further indicates a reduced polarization (&#916;V&#160;=&#160;0.06&#160;V) and enhanced capacitive contribution (b-value&#160;=&#160;0.663&#8211;0.799), attributed to MXene's dual role in facilitating ion diffusion and electron transport. This work provides a scalable, binder-free electrode design strategy, offering fundamental insights into MXene-phosphorus synergism for next-generation high-energy-density batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Modular Solid Phase Synthesis Approach for Glycocalix[4]Arene Derivatives and Their Multivalent Presentation on Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a calix[4]arene building block suitable for modular solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis and the preparation of functional glycocalix[4]arene. This allows us to incorporate carbohydrate ligands and further functionalities, such as alkynes at a specific position at the upper or lower rim of the calix[4]arene as demonstrated for the conjugation onto Au nanoparticles.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles and calix[n]arenes are well&#8208;established platforms for creating multivalent carbohydrate ligands that enhance binding avidity and selectivity toward carbohydrate&#8208;recognizing receptors, such as bacterial lectins. In this study, we present a modular synthesis protocol for tailor&#8208;made and (multi)functional glycocalix[4]arene derivatives using solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis. A calix[4]arene building block with a single carboxyl group on the lower rim and four nitro groups at the upper rim is introduced. This building block is attached to a solid support using standard solid phase peptide coupling conditions, followed by reduction of the upper rim nitro functionalities to yield four amine groups, that are further functionalized through solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis. Using this modular approach, we access a series of glyco&#8208;calix[4]arene structures that are then further conjugated onto ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. Conjugation is promoted either via one or via four alkyne groups on the glycocalixarene structure, providing a handle to tune the overall valency of the final glyco[4]calixarene&#8208;gold nanoparticle conjugates. Finally, the glycocalix[4]arene derivatives and conjugates are evaluated for their inhibitory potential against bacterial adhesion showing the importance of multivalent carbohydrate presentation to effectively block Escherichia coli (E. coli) adhesion.

         <title>Reassessing the Possibility of &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; Full Electron Delocalization Through 3D Aromatic Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic carborane clusters interact with &#960;&#8208;systems primarily through local negative hyperconjugation. This interaction is highly dependent on the cluster's size and symmetry. Significant through&#8208;cage delocalization occurs mainly in radical species, though similar behavior can also be observed in simple hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Over the past few decades, considerable attention has been devoted to explore the electronic interactions of various substituents with 3D aromatic carboranes. In the case of substituents possessing available p&#8208;orbitals, conjugation between the &#960;&#8208;system and the &#963;&#8208;framework of the carborane is possible via negative hyperconjugation, where electron density from a filled &#960;&#8208;orbital overlaps with an adjacent &#963;* orbital. However, this is inherently a local effect, which was further bolstered by the fact that aromatic conjugation between planar (2D) &#960;&#8208;systems and the 3D aromatic carborane cage does not exist. Nevertheless, recent studies have raised the intriguing possibility that 3D aromatic carboranes may function as &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridges, enabling electronic communication between spatially separated &#960;&#8208;systems. Herein, we investigated the potential conjugation of various substituents with or through carborane systems to better understand the nature of the possible interaction. We demonstrated that significant delocalization through the carborane cluster can be achieved only in the case of radical systems; however, this type of interaction is not a unique feature of carboranes, as similar behavior can also be observed in saturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>Quasiracemic Crystallization of Luminescent Chiral Molecules: Mechanochromic Luminescence and Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of naphthalene&#8208; and benzothiadiazole&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;binaphthol derivatives was designed as luminescent quasiracemates. Quasiracemic crystals of these compounds exhibit CPL, which cannot be observed in racemic crystals.








Abstract
The arrangement of molecules plays a crucial role in governing the luminescent properties of organic crystals. While quasiracemic crystallization, based on the co&#8208;crystallization of two structurally similar but nonidentical enantiomeric molecules, offers a promising strategy for organizing distinct species within a single crystal, its potential for tuning luminescent behavior remains largely unexplored. Herein, we have prepared quasiracemic crystals from a pair of enantiomeric binaphthyl derivatives functionalized with either ethynylnaphthalene or ethynylbenzothiadiazole groups. The molecular arrangement of the quasiracemic crystal is analogous to that of the racemic ethynylnaphthalene derivative, whereas the quasiracemic crystals exhibit mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) behavior similar to that of the racemic ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. Notably, the quasiracemic crystals exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and the CPL sign is inverted relative to that of the enantiopure crystal of the ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. These results highlight quasiracemic crystallization as a new strategy for modulating MCL and CPL properties.

         <title>Development of CPA&#8208;Catalyzed &#946;&#8208;Selective Reductive Amination of Cardenolides for the Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Hydrolytically Stable Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a new method to produce hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroids using a CPA&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination of cardenolide aglycones. The oleandrin and digitoxigenin analogs exhibited promising activity against various cancer cell lines in the NCI&#8208;60 screen. Additionally, nanomolar concentrations of a new oleandrin analog lowered levels of the cellular prion protein in T98G cells.








Abstract
This article describes the development of novel, hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroid analogs featuring a 3&#946;&#8208;amine moiety instead of the commonly found 3&#946;&#8208;carbohydrates such as oleandrose. To establish the desired 3&#946;&#8208;configuration stereoselectively, a new method based on chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination with Hantzsch esters was developed. This method utilizes readily available unsubstituted (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;based hydrogen phosphate as the catalyst, enabling the synthesis of 13 different 5&#946;&#8208;androsterone and digitoxigenin analogs with up to 36:1&#160;&#946;:&#945; diastereoselectivity. Additionally, this strategy was applied to generate two novel oleandrigenin analogs 15a and 15g in 3 steps from readily available gitoxigenin. The synthetic analogs were subjected to the NCI&#8208;60 human tumor cell lines screen, and several different digitoxigenin derivatives with tumor cell growth inhibitory power in submicromolar range were identified. The subsequent in vitro evaluation of digitoxigenin and oleandrin derivatives 13a, 13g, 15a, and 15g demonstrated that these four analogs reduced steady&#8208;state ATP1A1 levels in T98G cells in the 12&#8211;96&#160;nM range. Interestingly, only the oleandrin analog 15g lowered also steady&#8208;state levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), the main therapeutic target for the treatment of prion diseases.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Naphthalene and Polycyclic Arenes by Iron(III) TAML/H2O2 in Water Aiming at Their Efficient Removal from Aqua Natural Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron transfer from naphthalene at an oxidized iron TAML species (TAML = tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) is a key step of its environmentally relevant deep degradation by hydrogen peroxide in water leading first to naphthoquinones which are further converted to smaller fragments. Other polycyclic arenes are also oxidized, often faster than naphthalene consistent with their lower ionization potentials than that of naphthalene..</dc:description>

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Mediated Hydroaminoalkylation of Conjugated Dienes Probed by a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)&#8208;ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of main product, (E)&#8208;4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two&#8208;step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis&#8208;amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity&#8208;determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis&#8208;amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT&#8208;assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;catalyzed mechanochemical trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols via in situ generated N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium salt as CF3 source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium catalyzed trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;). This is the first ever report on trifluoromethylation using in situ generated of N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate as the CF3 source under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The present one&#8208;pot transformation enabled direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers. It has also shown a remarkable compatibility toward aroyltrifluoroborates for the mechanochemical synthesis of aryl trifluoromethyl ketones. This method offers several advantages, including operational simplicity and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the current mechanochemical approach not only proceeds under sustainable conditions but also provides a practical route for the late&#8208;stage modifications of related substrates to access the valuable fluorinated compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Ni&#8208;C Bond Formation via Selective Gas&#8208;Phase C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage in 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic investigations into the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds to form M&#8722;C (M: metal) bonds are crucial for the comprehension, optimization, and design of chemical reactions. In this study, collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent a 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively) cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds, leading to the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#8722;C bonds. In contrast, the [NiL]+ cation, without the phen ligand, produces small neutral molecules, such as CH4, CO, and C6H6. Theoretical calculations suggest that a decarboxylation&#8208;like mechanism is responsible for the generation of the M&#8722;C bond in [(phen)Ni(bac)]+ (bac = benzoylacetone). Although the phen ligand is not directly involved in the fragmentation of nickel complex cations, it significantly alters the electronic structures and fragmentation mechanisms of nickel complex cations. This work presents a novel approach for the generation of M&#8722;C bonds through a gas&#8208;phase method, and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the selective cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Selective Synthesis of SBT and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS Intergrown Zeolites Using Asymmetric Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents for Upgrading of Polyethylene Pyrolysis Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) based on asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonia compounds have been rarely explored in crystallization of zeolites, owing to difficulties in structural control. Their use holds promise to regulate physicochemical properties of zeolitic materials towards enhancing the relevant catalytic performances. In this study, a stepwise alkylation of 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dab) to generate asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary derivatives has been established, enabling their use as OSDAs in large pore zeolite synthesis. Through exploratory syntheses, we showed that small Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;Et can direct the formation of SBT zeolite in multiple inorganic cation (Cs+&#8208;Na+) crystallization, while the bulky Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;iPr and Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;sBu lead to the formation of FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowths. The obtained SBT zeolite exhibited higher olefin selectivity in catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil derived from polyethylene, with respect to alike cage&#8208;containing faujasite (FAU) zeolite. Our findings expand the library of asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and highlight their capability to achieve phase selective synthesis of large pore zeolites.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals of carbonic acid (H2CO3) were synthesized in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell at moderate pressures between 5&#8208;13 GPa by reacting H2O with CO2. Its monoclinic crystal structure (P21/n with Z = 4) has been obtained from synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments at ~8 GPa. The positions of the hydrogen atoms have been determined from the experimental data. Density functional theory&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural model derived from the diffraction data. This is the first single crystal structure solution of water&#8208;free carbonic acid, H2CO3. The structural model provided here differs from structural models reported earlier for lower pressures derived from neutron powder diffraction data.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, representing the first example of the regioselectivity reversal for this class of substrates. Notably, the transformation proceeds efficiently with a low catalyst loading (1.5 mol %). A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed, supported by control experiments and in situ HRMS analysis. Photophysical investigations of the annulated products reveal moderate to high quantum yields, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, these molecules demonstrate promising sensitivity as picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue from Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO2 has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO2 under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting carbon nanospheres (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO2&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO2 from ~3.2 eV to 2.91 eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over six&#8208;cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst&#8217;s stability and reusability.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization For Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclohexanol&#8208;based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations. The contextual use of both n&#8208;alkyl and glycan&#8208;mimetic acceptors for automated optimization enabled translation of optimized glycosylation temperature to highly efficient solid phase synthesis of disaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation), or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin switching devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Tuning in NHC Ligands: Synergistic Effects of BIAN  &#960; &#8208;Conjugation and Aryl  &#963; &#8208;Modulation in Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X = F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &#960;&#8211;&#963; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X&#8208;ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine&#8208;grained design of NHC&#8208;based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R = C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 was investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. DFT calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8211; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the +III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on resonance 1H free induction decays, 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated to the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valance systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#183;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant validation of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII&#160;versus heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI&#160;complexes for circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8211;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;complexes&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs&#160;&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and&#160;&#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and the binuclear&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (glum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying&#160;1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in&#160;IrAu&#8208;4.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &gt;99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes Containing Bifluorenylidene Units via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki Coupling/Heck Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
