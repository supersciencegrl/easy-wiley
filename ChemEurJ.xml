         <title>Insights into the effect of adsorption preference of additives on the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role to affect catalytic performance, while it is persistently challenging to tailor via crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced in the synthetic process of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, while their role and the underlying mechanism are yet well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite was unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either the inhibition effect or the promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites varying from sphere&#8208;like, plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Catalytic Photooxidations Using Solvent as a Sacrificial Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Catalyst recovery is an integral part of photoredox catalysis. It is often solved by adding another component&#8208;a sacrificial agent&#8208; whose role is to convert the catalyst back into its original oxidation state. However, an additive may cause a side reaction thus decreasing the selectivity and overall efficiency. Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent&#8208;acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, in combination with anaerobic conditions. This is allowed by the unique properties of the catalyst, 7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaflavinium chloride existing in both strongly oxidizing and reducing forms, whose strength is increased by excitation with visible light. Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over&#8208;oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70%. 4&#8208;Substituted 1&#8208;phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80&#8208;100% and, moreover, with yields 31&#8208;98% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system. Mechanistic studies based on UV&#8208;VIS spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements showed the process involving an electron release from an excited deazaflavin radical to acetonitrile forming solvated electron is crucial for the catalyst recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversibly Porous Supramolecular Peptide Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building&#8208;blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of this exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metalpeptide frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BPh3 catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of secondary amines and the C&#8208;methylenation (methylene&#8208;bridge formation between aromatic rings) of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or 1&#8208;methylindoles in the presence of CO2 and PhSiH3, and these reactions proceed at 30&#8211;40 &#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In contrast, B(C6F5)3 shows little or no activity. 11B NMR spectra suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8211;. The detailed mechanism of the BPh3&#8208;catalyzed the N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline (1) with CO2 and PhSiH3 was studied by DFT calculations. BPh3 promotes the conversion of two substrates (N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2) into a twitterionic carbamate to give three&#8208;component species [Ph(Me)(H)N+CO2&#8211;&#183;&#183;&#183;BPh3]. The carbamate and BPh3 act as the nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8211;, which is used to produce key CO2&#8208;derived species, such as silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal, essential for the N&#8208;methylation of 1. DFT calculations also suggested other mechanisms involving water for the generation of [HBPh3]&#8211; species.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advance in the Research of Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Based Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of solar energy is  crucial  for alleviating the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development. In recent years, photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable batteries have attracted researchers because they can directly convert and store solar energy in the batteries. And it also can be used like a normal battery without light illumination. Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries have received more attention than other energy storage systems due to their higher energy density and relatively mature development. This review focuses on the design of various photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries including Li&#8208;ion, Li&#8208;S, Li&#8208;O  2  , Li&#8208;CO  2  and Li&#8208;I batteries, as well as the working mechanism of photoelectrodes in these batter systems. The basic understanding and challenge of photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. At last, perspectives about the photoelectrode development are provided in the summary to advance photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Epoxy/Surface Adhesion: Understanding the Interphase Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy resins coatings are commonly found in corrosion protection coatings but the presence of water can affect their adhesion to the substrate, often weakening the adhesion of the coating to the solid, reducing its efficiency. Nevertheless, small amounts of water can enhance the epoxy/substrate interactions. In this work, the interphase region of an epoxy precursor and metal oxide substrates is investigated using molecular simulations and it is found that water accumulates between the epoxy layer and the solid substrate. At high water concentrations (9%wt) the interaction between the epoxy precursor and the solid surface is weakened regardless of the nature of the solid, but at low water concentrations the nature of the solid surface becomes important. For hematite, the presence of water decreases the strength of adhesion but for goethite the presence of a small amount of water (3%wt) enhances the adhesion to the surface resulting in a densification at the interface.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epoxy resins coatings are commonly found in corrosion protection coatings but the presence of water can affect their adhesion to the substrate, often weakening the adhesion of the coating to the solid, reducing its efficiency. Nevertheless, small amounts of water can enhance the epoxy/substrate interactions.

         <dc:description>Borate buffer was found to have both structural and functional roles within a low&#8208;cost tri&#8208;copper electrocatalyst for homogeneous water oxidation that exhibits a high turnover frequency of 310 s  &#8208;1  . The borate buffer was shown to facilitate the catalytic activity by both bridging the three Cu ions and participating in O&#8208;O bond formation. Phosphate and acetate buffers did not show such roles, making borate a unique player in this catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Installing Reduction Responsiveness into Biomolecules by Introducing Nitroaryl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
RSVP: This Concept summarizes the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, constructed by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, with a focus on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.







Abstract
Artificially synthesized stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecules are attractive as molecular tools for monitoring and modulating biological systems. In biological systems, redox stimuli are common, and their dysregulation is typically linked to various abnormal or disease states. In this Concept article, the molecular design of reduction&#8208;responsive biomolecules, such as peptides, nucleic acids, and saccharides, which are produced by introducing nitroaryl groups into them, is reviewed with a special emphasis on simple 4&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;based motifs.

         <title>A Route to Lipid ALC&#8208;0315: a Key Component of a COVID&#8208;19 mRNA Vaccine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
ALC&#8208;0315 is a key component of the Pfizer&#8208;BioNTech COVID&#8208;19 vaccine and a highly sought&#8208;after lipid for nucleic acid therapeutics research. This paper, a study in reductive amination, describes a synthetic route that more than doubles the overall yield relative to the published one. Key aspects of the work include the use of (i) a protected form of a poorly organic&#8208;soluble aminoalcohol, (ii) a TEMPO/bleach oxidation to produce crucial aldehydes, and (iii) a more organic&#8208;soluble triacyloxyborohydride reagent.







Abstract
This paper describes a synthesis of ALC&#8208;0315 by a sequence that more than doubles the overall yield relative to the published one, and that employs much cleaner reactions, thereby facilitating purifications to a considerable extent

         <dc:description>
Access to diverse polycyclic scaffolds via an efficient calcium catalyzed dehydration&#8208;cyclization strategy is described. This approach provides a range of small molecule fragments bearing a range of medicinally relevant functional groups. Both Lewis and Bronsted acid pathways are in use, with the ability to fine tune the reactivity depending on the choice of solvent.







Abstract
A range of highly functionalized polycyclic fragments have been synthesized, employing a catalytic dehydrative cyclization. A range of nucleophiles are shown to be successful, with the reaction producing numerous high value motifs.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Interpretation of Interatomic Charge Transfer and Electron Exchange Effects by Combining Static and Kinetic Potentials and Associated Vector Fields
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and consequent electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between the zero&#8208;flux surfaces of atomic and electrostatic and kinetic potential&#8208;based basins. Behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials included in the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied.







Abstract
Intricate behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials from the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied. Channels of locally enhanced kinetic potential and corresponding saddle Lagrange points were found between chemically bonded atoms. Superposition of electrostatic 
 and kinetic 
 potentials and electron density 
 allowed partitioning any molecules and crystals into atomic 
&#8208; and potential&#8208;based 
&#8208;basins; 
&#8208;basins explicitly account for the electron exchange effect, which is missed for 
&#8208;ones. Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and related electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between zero&#8208;flux surfaces of 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins. The gap between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins represents the charge transfer, while the gap between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins is a real&#8208;space manifestation of sharing the transferred electrons caused by the static exchange and kinetic effects as a response against the electron transfer. The regularity describing relative positions of 
&#8208;, 
&#8208;, and 
&#8208; basin boundaries between interacting atoms was proposed. The position of 
&#8208;boundary between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;ones within an electron occupier atom determines the extent of transferred electron sharing. The stronger an H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond is, the deeper hydrogen atom's 
&#8208;basin penetrates oxygen atom's 
&#8208;basin, while for covalent bonds a 
&#8208;boundary closely approaches a 
&#8208;one indicating almost complete sharing of the transferred electrons. In the case of ionic bonds, the same region corresponds to electron pairing within the 
&#8208;basin of an electron occupier atom.

Highly emissive 1D manganese(II) halide hybrid is successfully prepared by self&#8208;assembly of accessible amine acid salt and low&#8208;cost manganese chloride. The known d&#8211;d transition of Mn2+ in octahedral coordination results in strong red emission with PLQY as high as 67.1&#8197;%. The as&#8208;formed 1D manganese(II) hybrids exhibit excellent CD signals in ground state and distinguished CPL activity with dissymmetry factor g as high as 6.3*10&#8722;3 in excited state due to the existence of chiral amine acid salt.







Abstract
Circular polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials attract great attentions owing to their widely applications in 3D optical displays and encrypted transmission. Inspired by the strategies adopted in perovskite based CPL materials, herein, CPL&#8208;active hybrids (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3 were successfully prepared by assembling chiral D/L tert&#8208;butyl prolinate with manganese (II) chloride. Single crystal structures show the as&#8208;formed hybrids possess one&#8208;dimensional (1D) structure containing linear chains of face&#8208;sharing MnCl6 octahedral surrounded by prolinate cations. The 1D Mn(II) hybrids display strong red emission peaked at 646&#8197;nm with PLQY of 67.1&#8197;% and 57.2&#8197;% for d&#8208;type and l&#8208;type, respectively, representing the highest PLQY for 1D MnII hybrids. Interestingly, the 1D Mn(II) hybrids exhibit prominent circular dichroism (CD) signals and remarkable CPL activity with the dissymmetry factor g of 6.1*10&#8722;3 and &#8722;6.3*10&#8722;3 from 550 to 800&#8197;nm for (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3, respectively, owing to the existence of chiral cations. It is worthy noted the obtained g represents the highest value for non&#8208;lead organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids.

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) Through Synthetic Optimisation and Postsynthetic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexibility of the MOF MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) is described and compared to its well&#8208;established Fe analogue. Its breathing behaviour can be controlled through installation of formate bridges during synthesis that ensure rigidity by structural buttressing, or by postsynthetic bromination of the fumarate linker to induce rigidity by the steric influence of the bulky linker substituents.







Abstract
Breathing behaviour in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties. In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre&#8208;synthetically using functionalised linkers. Herein, it was shown that MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by 1) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate&#8208;buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous; and 2) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non&#8208;porous. In addition to providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, it was shown that bromination of the formate&#8208;bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.

         <title>Structural and ITC Characterization of Peptide&#8208;Protein Binding: Thermodynamic Consequences of Cyclization Constraints, a Case Study on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>

Does affinity come from constraint ? The thermodynamic and structural analysis of a series of constrained peptide ligands and unconstrained analogues accurately describes the binding process. It highlights how the variation in conformational and vibrational entropies associated with the constraints impacts the affinity.







Abstract
Macrocyclization constraints are widely used in the design of protein ligands to stabilize their bioactive conformation and increase their affinities. However, the resulting changes in binding entropy can be puzzling and uncorrelated to affinity gains. Here, the thermodynamic (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) and structural (X&#8208;ray, NMR and CD) analysis of a complete series of lactam&#8208;bridged peptide ligands of the vascular endothelial growth factor, and their unconstrained analogs are reported. It is shown that differences in thermodynamics arise mainly from the folding energy of the peptide upon binding. The systematic reduction in conformational entropy penalty due to helix pre&#8208;organization can be counterbalanced by an unfavorable vibrational entropy change if the constraints are too rigid. The gain in configurational entropy partially escapes the enthalpy/entropy compensation and leads to an improvement in affinity. The precision of the analytical ITC method makes this study a possible benchmark for constrained peptides optimization.

         <title>Understanding the Reshaping of Fluorinated Polyester Vitrimers by Kinetic and DFT Studies of the Transesterification Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study of a transesterification reaction were conducted in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the reaction rate and provide a molecular model for the observed accelerating effect of proximal fluorinated groups in the reshaping of transesterification vitrimers.







Abstract
Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Following up on a recent report on catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules are presented in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.

         <title>A Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO&#8208;Releasing Complex: Photoreactivities and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Highly Distorted Tricarbonyl Rhenium Phthalocyanines</title>

Designing photoCORMs: A new photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule has been developed by using tricarbonyl rhenium(I) phthalocyanine. The distorted structures of the Re phthalocyanine complexes allowed their ultrafast excited&#8208;state dynamics to be analysed by spin&#8208;orbit coupling.







Abstract
A complex comprising one [Re(CO)3]+ unit and a phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand (Re1Pc) is shown to function as a photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule (photoCORM) in the presence of O2 and a coordinative solvent under irradiation with red light, which can deeply penetrate living tissues. Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements indicate very short excited&#8208;state lifetimes and ultrafast intersystem crossing for Re1Pc and Re2Pc, which contains two [Re(CO)3]+ units. The excited&#8208;state properties are ascribed to efficient spin&#8211;orbit coupling and large Franck&#8211;Condon factors originating from the complexes&#8217; distorted structures, that is, unsymmetric coordination of [Re(CO)3]+ unit(s), one of which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of a symmetrically substituted Pc with two [Re(CO)3]+ units. Re1Pc represents a promising red&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoCORM that can be applied in biological environments or therapeutic applications.

The excited-state properties are ascribed to efficient spin&#8211;orbit coupling and large Franck&#8211;Condon factors originating from the complexes&#8217; distorted structures, that is, unsymmetric coordination of [Re(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; unit(s), one of which was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis of a symmetrically substituted Pc with two [Re(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; units. &lt;b&gt;Re&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pc&lt;/b&gt; represents a promising red-light-driven photoCORM that can be applied in biological environments or therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Defects in Conjugated Polymers On&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis not only allows growing nanomaterials that are not achievable by traditional wet chemistry but also, combined with scanning probe techniques, enables the structure and electronic properties to be resolved with atomic resolution. Here, atomic&#8208;scale structural defects are deliberately introduced into an anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and it is shown that such defects may give rise of &#960;&#8208;magnetism. These results demonstrate the potential of defect engineering strategy for fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers.







Abstract
Atomic scale defects significantly affect the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Here, isolated atomic&#8208;scale defects are deliberately introduced into a prototypical anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and its local density of states is carefully examined on the atomic scale to show how individual defects modify the inherent electronic and magnetic properties of this one&#8208;dimensional systems. Scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy experiments, supplemented with density functional theory calculations, reveal the existence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around certain defects, which is associated with the formation of a local magnetic moment accompanied by substantial mitigation of the mobility of charge carriers. While defects in traditionally synthesized polymers lead to arbitrary conformations, the presented results clearly reflect the preferential formation of low dimensional defects at specific polymer sites, which may introduce the possibility of engineering macroscopic defects in surface&#8208;synthesized conjugated polymers.

         <title>[(CH3)Al(CH2)]12: Methylaluminomethylene (MAM&#8208;12)</title>

The next stage towards the cage: [(CH3)Al(CH2)]12 (MAM&#8208;12) is accessible in high yield through Ga/Al transmetalation with homoleptic gallium methylene [Ga8(CH2)12] and trimethylaluminium. MAM&#8208;12 adopts a cage&#8208;like structure, similar to the structural motifs proposed for the elusive methylaluminoxane [(CH3)Al(O)]n (MAO), featuring three distinct aluminium coordinations. MAM&#8208;12 is insoluble in aliphatic/aromatic solvents and disaggregates to MAM&#8208;3 and [Me2Al&#8208;CH2&#8208;AlMe2] in a coordinating solvent like THF as suggested by a DOSY NMR experiments.







Abstract
The molecular structure of enigmatic &#8220;poly(aluminium&#8208;methyl&#8208;methylene)&#8221; (first reported in 1968) has been unraveled in a transmetalation reaction with gallium methylene [Ga8(CH2)12] and AlMe3. The existence of cage&#8208;like methylaluminomethylene moieties was initially suggested by the reaction of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metallocene complex [Cp*2Lu{(&#956;&#8208;Me)2AlMe2}] with excess AlMe3 affording the deca&#8208;aluminium cluster [Cp*4Lu2(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)12Al10(CH3)8] in low yield (Cp*=C5Me5). Treatment of [Ga8(CH2)12] with excess AlMe3 reproducibly gave the crystalline dodeca&#8208;aluminium complex [(CH3)12Al12(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)12] (MAM&#8208;12). Revisiting a previous approach to &#8220;poly(aluminium&#8208;methyl&#8208;methylene&#8221; by using a (C5H5)2TiCl2/AlMe3 (1&#8201;:&#8201;100) mixture led to amorphous solids displaying solubility behavior and spectroscopic features similar to those of crystalline MAM&#8208;12. The gallium methylene&#8208;derived MAM&#8208;12 was used as an efficient methylene transfer reagent for ketones.

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrostatic pressures of a few tens of to hundred bar are sufficient to suppress liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequent aggregation and fibril formation of immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly resistant to unfolding under pressure, however, so the immunological activity of foods processed under high pressure is preserved.







Abstract
The high colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate the specific protein&#8208;protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate the high sensitivity to pressure of globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The addition of excipients has only a minor effect. The high pressure sensitivity observed is due to the fact that these flexible Y&#8208;shaped molecules create a considerable amount of void volume in the condensed phase, leading to an overall decrease in the volume of the system upon dissociation of the droplet phase by pressure already at a few tens of to hundred bar. Moreover, we show that immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly resistant to unfolding under pressure, and can even sustain pressures up to about 6&#8197;kbar without conformational changes. This implies that immunoglobulins are resistant to the pressure treatment of foods, such as milk, in high&#8208;pressure food&#8208;processing technologies, thereby preserving their immunological activity.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Enhanced Lithium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding by Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic Rotaxanes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of selective lithium halide recognition by a mechanical bonded heteroditopic host is achieved using a series of halogen and hydrogen bonding [2]rotaxanes. A co&#8208;bound lithium cation switches on halide anion binding which increases greatly with increasing number of halogen bond donors. Ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding heteroditopic macrocycles, highlighting the importance of the mechanical bond effect.







Abstract
A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion&#8208;pairs. 1H&#8197;NMR ion&#8208;pair titration experiments in CD3CN:CDCl3 solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co&#8208;bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all&#8208;XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion&#8208;pair binding. Notably, ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle&#8208;macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion&#8208;pair recognition in general.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first examples&lt;/b&gt; of selective lithium halide recognition by a mechanical bonded heteroditopic host is achieved using a series of halogen and hydrogen bonding [2]rotaxanes. A co-bound lithium cation switches on halide anion binding which increases greatly with increasing number of halogen bond donors. Ion-pair binding was not observed with the corresponding heteroditopic macrocycles, highlighting the importance of the mechanical bond effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion-pairs. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR ion-pair titration experiments in CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN:CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch-on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co-bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all-XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion-pair binding. Notably, ion-pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle-macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion-pair recognition in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich EDOT Linkers in Tetracationic bis&#8208;Triarylborane Chromophores: Influence on Water Stability, Biomacromolecule Sensing, and Photoinduced Cytotoxicity</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with EDOT linkers, show red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;linked analogues, with one derivative emitting in the NIR. A water&#8208;stable EDOT&#8208;linked tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue efficiently photo&#8208;induce 1O2 production. Both bind to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under visible light irradiation, exhibit rapid, strong cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
Three novel tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers, and their neutral precursors, showed significant red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;containing analogues, with one of the EDOT&#8208;derivatives emitting in the NIR region. Only the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation was stable in aqueous solution, indicating that direct attachment of a thiophene or even 3&#8208;methylthiophene to the boron atom is insufficient to provide hydrolytic stability in aqueous solution. Further comparative analysis of the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue revealed efficient photo&#8208;induced singlet oxygen production, with the consequent biological implications. Thus, both analogues bind strongly to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, very efficiently enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under intense visible light irradiation, they exhibit almost instantaneous and very strong cytotoxic effects, presumably attributed to singlet oxygen production. Thus, both compounds are intriguing theranostic agents, whose intracellular and probably intra&#8208;tissue location can be monitored by strong fluorescence, allowing switching on of the strong bioactivity by well&#8208;focused visible light.

         <title>Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission from an AB&#8208;Type Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent polymers are generally molecularly designed by polymerization of luminescent moieties, in which the polymerization method exbibits limited effect on luminescent properties. In addition, the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Here, a &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for the molecular design of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer via Barbier polymerization, resulting in a series of nonconjugated luminescent polymers through polymerization&#8208;induced emission.







Abstract
Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending the &#960; system of the polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into the polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi&#8208;step procedures. Meanwhile, according to the step&#8208;growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from an AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) from an AB&#8208;type monomer. The key step in the realization of the hyperbranched polymer is bi&#8208;functionalization of a mono&#8208;functional group. Through a Barbier reaction between an organohalide and an ester group in one pot, bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional ester is realized through two&#8208;step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through&#8208;space conjugation and inter&#8208; and intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effects induced by polymer chain, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation&#8208;induced emission type PIEgen. Whereas, it is aggregation&#8208;caused quenching type PIEgen if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen are in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting systems. This work, therefore, expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymers through &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one&#8208;pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.

         <title>Nonbonding/Bonding Molecular Orbital Regulation of Nitrogen&#8208;Boron&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;embedded Blue/Green Multiresonant TADF Emitters with High Efficiency and Color Purity</title>

Ultra&#8208;pure&#8208;blue/green OLED: Three types of novel (N&#8722;B&#8722;O) embedded MR&#8208;TADF emitters are successfully developed for high efficiency and narrow emission organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). In this study, the molecular orbital characters were regulated by adjusting the position of heteroatoms to achieve color&#8208;tunable of MR&#8208;TADF. The ultra&#8208;pure&#8208;blue/green devices exhibit high external quantum efficiency over 20&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum less than 50&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this study, we synthesized and characterized multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials embedded with nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (N&#8722;B&#8722;O), exhibiting color&#8208;tunability between blue and green, namely NBO, m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO. The three emitter materials showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 96&#8201;%/25&#8197;nm, 87&#8201;%/17&#8197;nm, and 99&#8201;%/19&#8197;nm, respectively. For m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO, the emission color could be tuned from blue to green by regulating the nonbonding/bonding molecular orbital characters. Owing to the expanded planar molecular structure, m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO showed high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;) of 88&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%, respectively. OLEDs were prepared with NBO, m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO, exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies of 16.8&#8201;%, 24.2&#8201;%, and 21.6&#8201;%, respectively. NBO and m&#8208;DiNBO exhibited pure&#8208;blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.142) and (0.126, 0.098), respectively. p&#8208;DiNBO showed pure&#8208;green emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.258, 0.665).

         <dc:description>
A high colloidal stability is important for pharmaceutical applications of antibody solutions. We demonstrate a high pressure sensitivity of antibody condensates as a suitable means to suppress liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly pressure resistant against unfolding, however, and can sustain high pressures without changing conformation. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Winter and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201658).

How to activate a Re&#8722;CO bond: Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) have attracted significant attention because of the vasorelaxation effect of CO. When a phthalocyanine ligand was used, the Re&#8722;CO bonds were successfully activated by a low&#8208;energy photon of red light, which can penetrate deeply into living tissues. Thus, this study provides key insights and a foundation for designing photoCORMs for biological or therapeutic applications. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kato, K. Onda, K. Ishii, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200716).

         <title>Lanthanide SMMs Based on Belt Macrocycles: Recent Advances and General Trends</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 48, August 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A belt to control anisotropy. This review presents the development of mononuclear lanthanide SMMs based on belt macrocycles. Literature systems are classified in crown ethers, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown complexes. Molecule families are compared in terms of their coordination number and geometry, focusing on the degree of structural distortion associated with different belt macrocycles. General trends with respect to demagnetization barriers and effective suppression of transverse magnetic anisotropy components are also discussed.







Abstract
Enhancement of axial magnetic anisotropy is the central objective to push forward the performance of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) complexes. In the case of mononuclear lanthanide complexes, the chemical environment around the paramagnetic ion must be tuned to place strongly interacting ligands along either the axial positions or the equatorial plane, depending on the oblate or prolate preference of the selected lanthanide. One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial&#8208;equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.

         <title>Characterization of a novel cytochrome involved in Geobacter sulfurreducens&#8217; electron harvesting pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron harvesting bacteria are key targets to develop microbial electrosynthesis technologies, which are valid alternatives for the production of value&#8208;added compounds without utilization of fossil fuels. Geobacter sulfurreducens, that is capable of donating and accepting electrons from electrodes, is one of the most promising electroactive bacteria. Its electron transfer mechanisms to electrodes have been progressively elucidated, however the electron harvesting pathways are still poorly understood. Previous studies showed that the periplasmic cytochromes PccH and GSU2515 are overexpressed in current&#8208;consuming G. sulfurreducens biofilms. PccH was characterized, though no putative partners have been identified. In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low&#8208;spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N&#8208;terminal region and an &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox&#8208;linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligand in the reduced and oxidized state, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and is modulated by the pH in the physiological range: &#8208;78 mV at pH 6 and &#8208;113 mV at pH 7. Such pH&#8208;dependence coupled to the redox&#8208;linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain. Biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments indicated that GSU2515 and PccH form a redox complex. Overall, the data obtained highlights for the first time how periplasmic proteins bridge the electron transfer between the outer and inner membrane in the electron harvesting pathways of G. sulfurreducens.</dc:description>

In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low-spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N-terminal region and an &#945;-helical C-terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox-linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligand in the reduced and oxidized state, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and is modulated by the pH in the physiological range: -78 mV at pH 6 and -113 mV at pH 7. Such pH-dependence coupled to the redox-linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton-coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobate Nanosheet Assembly with Au NPs and CdS QDs as a Highly Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Niobate nanosheets have aroused widespread interest in recent years for their prospects in catalysis. The exploration of 2D niobate catalysis with stable and efficient properties is still the focus in chemistry and materials science. Herein, we demonstrated the successful fabrication of 2D CdS/Au/HNb  3  O  8  catalyst which revealed efficient photocatalytic properties in H  2  evolution, oxidative self&#8208;coupling of amines to imines, and degradation of dyes. Especially the assembled architecture can give a rate of 5.85 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  of photocatalytic H  2  evolution, an ~254&#8208;fold enhancement, compared with bare HNb  3  O  8  nanosheets under identical conditions. In accordance with density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, the vast improvements are benefited from efficient migration and separation of charge carriers. Besides, the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs enhances the light harvesting capacity and boosts the generation of hot electrons, efficiently improving the visible&#8208;light absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium carbonate dissolution from the laboratory to the ocean: kinetics and mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ultimate fate, over the course of millennia, of nearly all of the carbon dioxide formed by human kind is for it to react with calcium carbonate in the world&#8217;s oceans. Although, this reaction is of global relevance, aspects of the calcite dissolution reaction remain poorly described with apparent contradictions present throughout the expansive literature. In this perspective we aim to evidence how a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hampered developments in this area. These insights have important implications for both idealised experiments performed under laboratory conditions and for the measurement and modelling of oceanic calcite sediment dissolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Variety of Niobium(V) Polyoxo Clusters Obtained from the Reaction with Aromatic Monocarboxylic Acids: Isolation of {Nb2O}, {Nb4O4} and {Nb8O12} Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polynuclear niobium(V)&#8208;based carboxylate oxo clusters: A series of aryl monocarboxylate ligands was used to isolate molecular coordination complexes corresponding to dinuclear {Nb2O}, tetranuclear {Nb4O4}, or octanuclear {Nb8O12} niobium(V)&#8208;centered poly&#8208;oxo clusters related to different hydrolysis rates.







Abstract
The reactivity of aryl monocarboxylic acids (benzoic, 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;naphtoic, 4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic, and anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylic acids) as complexing agents for the ethoxide niobium(V) (Nb(OEt)5 precursor has been investigated. A total of eight coordination complexes were isolated with distinct niobium(V) nuclearities as well as carboxylate complexation states. The use of benzoic acid gives a tetranuclear core Nb4(&#956;2&#8208;O)4(L)4(OEt)8] (L=benzoate (1)) with four Nb&#8722;(&#956;2&#8208;O)&#8722;Nb linkages in a square plane configuration. A similar tetramer, 7, was obtained with 2&#8208;naphtoic acid by using a 55&#8201;% humid atmosphere synthetic route. Two types of dinuclear brick were identified with one central Nb&#8722;(&#956;2&#8208;O)&#8722;Nb linkage; they differ in their complexation state, with one bridging carboxylate ([Nb2(&#956;2&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OEt)(L)(OEt)6], with L=1&#8208;naphtoate (3) or anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (5)) or two bridging carboxylate groups ([Nb2(&#956;2&#8208;O)(L)2(OEt)6], with L=4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic (4) or anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (6)). An octanuclear moiety [Nb8(&#956;2&#8208;O)12(L)8(&#951;1&#8208;L)4&#8722;x(OEt)4+x] (with L=2&#8208;naphtoate, x=0 or 2; 8) was obtained by using a solvothermal route in acetonitrile; it has a cubic configuration with niobium centers at each node, linked by 12&#8197;&#956;2&#8208;O groups. The formation of the niobium oxo clusters was characterized by infrared and liquid 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to analyze the esterification reaction, which induces the release of water molecules that further react through oxolation with niobium atoms, in different {Nb2O}, {Nb4O4} and {Nb8O12} nuclearities.

Two types of dinuclear brick were identified with one central Nb&#8722;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O)&#8722;Nb linkage; they differ in their complexation state, with one bridging carboxylate ([Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O)(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OEt)(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], with &lt;i&gt;L=&lt;/i&gt;1-naphtoate (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) or anthracene-9-carboxylate (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;)) or two bridging carboxylate groups ([Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O)(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], with &lt;i&gt;L=&lt;/i&gt;4&#8217;-methylbiphenyl-4-carboxylic (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) or anthracene-9-carboxylate (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;)). An octanuclear moiety [Nb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(&#951;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

The formation of the niobium oxo clusters was characterized by infrared and liquid &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy in order to analyze the esterification reaction, which induces the release of water molecules that further react through oxolation with niobium atoms, in different {Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}, {Nb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} and {Nb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} nuclearities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photostable NIR&#8208;II Pigments from Extended Rylenecarboximides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of organic near infrared (NIR) absorbers based on rylenecarboximide and anthraquinone were obtained with maximum absorption peaks ranging from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm. A photostable pigment with NIR&#8208;II absorption was developed through de&#8208;alkylation reaction under formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic absorbers, named FNs and FPs, have been obtained with absorption maxima from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm and thus falling into the attractive second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II). The synthesis of their extended aromatic cores utilized an initial aryl&#8208;amination between 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI&#8208;NH2) or 9&#8208;aminoperylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI&#8208;NH2) with chloro&#8208;substituted 9,10&#8208;anthraquinones followed by a novel base&#8208;induced cyclodehydrogenation. A NIR&#8208;II pigment, compound FPP, was obtained through de&#8208;alkylation of a soluble precursor. The synthesis of this photostable pigment is high&#8208;yielding and avoids column chromatographic purification which is important for many applications.

         <title>Rational Tuning of the Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Ring Openings via SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a trap! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that ring&#8208;opening reaction barriers decrease in the order aziridines&gt;phosphiranes&gt;epoxides&gt;thiiranes, and thus do not simply follow the order of C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength. We illustrate that orbital interaction (HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate is an all&#8208;important factor for these reactions. The high reactivity of aziridines and phosphiranes substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups is mainly caused by a diminished steric repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule covalent inhibitors and probes continuously pushes the rapidly evolving field of chemical biology forward. A key element in these molecular tool compounds is the &#8220;electrophilic trap&#8221; that allows a covalent linkage with the target enzyme. The reactivity of this entity needs to be well balanced to effectively trap the desired enzyme, while not being attacked by off&#8208;target nucleophiles. Here we investigate the intrinsic reactivity of substrates containing a class of widely used electrophilic traps, the three&#8208;membered heterocycles with a nitrogen (aziridine), phosphorus (phosphirane), oxygen (epoxide) or sulfur atom (thiirane) as heteroatom. Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring opening of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y=NH, PH, O, S). It was revealed that the activation energy of the ring opening does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength, but steeply decreases from Y=NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all&#8208;important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron&#8208;withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity.

         <title>Improved Dye Survival in Expansion Microscopy through Stabilizer&#8208;conjugated Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples. However, reaction conditions inherent to the process bring about strong fluorescent signal loss during polymerization and digestion and thus limit the brightness of the signal obtained post expansion. Here, we explore the impact of stabilizer&#8208;containing organic fluorophores in ExM, as a mitigation strategy for this radical&#8208;induced dye degradation. Through direct conjugation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenylalanine (NPA) to our previously developed trifunctional reagents, we validate and demonstrate that these multifunctional linkers enable visualization of different organelles with improved fluorescent intensity, owning to protection of the dyes to radical induced degradation as well as to photoprotection upon imaging. At this point we cannot disentangle the relative contribution of both mechanisms. Furthermore, we report anchoring linkers that allow straightforward application of NPA or Trolox to commercially available fluorophore&#8208;conjugated antibodies. We show that these anchoring linkers enable complete retention of biological targets while increasing fluorophore photostability. Our results provide guidance in exploring these stabilizer&#8208;modified agents in ExM and methods for increased signal survival through the polymerization steps of the ExM protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Catalysts for CO2 Photoreduction: Discussing Structure Efficiency Strategies and Prospects for Scaled Production Based on Current Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels is accompanied by massive emissions of CO  2  , leading to severe energy shortage and intensified global warming. It is of great significance to develop and utilize renewable clean energy, while reducing the concentration of CO  2  in the atmosphere. Photocatalytic technology is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide conversion. Clearly, the achievement of the above goals largely depends on the design and construction of catalysts. This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO  2  reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to structure as well as performance is emphasized. In the end, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO  2  with high efficiency, even for practical application are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Nb2O5/Carbon Submicrostructures&#160;for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nb2O5&#160;possesses superior fast Li+&#160;storage capability for LIBs anode, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb2O5&#160;restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb2O5/Carbon (C)&#160;submicrostructures are fabricated&#160;by&#160;solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332 (194) mAh g&#8208;1&#160;after 1000 cycles at 1 (5) A g&#8208;1). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5&#160;nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C&#160;composite&#160;can protect Nb2O5&#160;nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb2O5/C submicrostructures with superior Li+&#160;storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.</dc:description>

Effective method for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter was developed, and the reaction was applied to the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine.







Abstract
An effective method was developed for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;addition of the substrates which were di&#8208; or trimethoxybenzene and 2&#8208;cyclohexenone linked by an alkyl chain proceeded smoothly in the presence of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% of TfOH. A variety of spiroindanes and spirotetralines were obtained with moderate to excellent yield by this method. The reaction was successfully applied in the first total synthesis of the unusual proaporphine alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine, which included the gram&#8208;scale spirocyclization and selective O&#8208;demethylation used KCN in DMSO condition as key steps.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Amidation of Allylic Alcohols by Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide catalyzed by an Earth&#8208;abundant Fe complex via a borrowing hydrogen pathway has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives were obtained under mild reaction conditions with exclusive linear selectivity and retention of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Allylic amines are useful building blocks in organic synthesis, so the development of green and efficient methods for the preparation of allylic amines are of great importance. An Fe&#8208;catalyzed amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives (30 examples) were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The reaction can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale, and the products could serve as chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by an Fe&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen process, which is different from most of the reported allylic amination reactions.

P=O&#8594;Element coordination keeps going and double cyclization involving the O, C, O&#8208;coordinating pincer&#8208;type ligand [5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;{(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2}2C6H2]&#8722; was achieved for the first time in case of the aryldiphenyldioxaphosphorane 9&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OH)&#8208;4,4&#8208;Ph2&#8208;3,5&#8208;O2&#8208;2,6&#8208;P2&#8208;4&#955;5&#8208;P&#8208;[5.3.1.0]&#8208;undeca&#8208;1(10),7(11),8&#8208;triene, existing as two diastereomers.







Abstract
The sequence of reactions of the phosphorus&#8208;containing aryllithium compound 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2Li (ArLi) with Ph2PCl, KMnO4, elemental sulfur and elemental selenium, respectively, gave the aryldiphenylphosphane chalcogenides 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2P(E)Ph2 (1, E=O; 2, E=S; 3, E=Se). Compound 1 partially hydrolysed giving [5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1&#8208;{(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2}&#8208;3&#8208;{(P(O)(OH)2}C6H2]P(O)Ph2 (4). The reaction of ArLi with PhPCl2 provided the benzoxaphosphaphosphole [1(P), 3(P)&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)OPPh&#8208;6&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;4&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]C6H2P (5i) as a mixture of the two diastereomers. The oxidation of 5i with elemental sulfur gave the benzoxaphosphaphosphole sulfide [1(P), 3(P)&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)OP(S)Ph&#8208;6&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;4&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]C6H2 (5) as pair of enantiomers P1(R), P3(S)/P1(S), P3(R) of the diastereomer (RS/SR)&#8208;5 (5b). The aryldiphenylphosphane 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2PPh2 (6) was obtained from the reaction of the corresponding aryldiphenylphosphane sulfide 2 with either sodium hydride, NaH, or disodium iron tetracarbonyl, Na2Fe(CO)4. The oxidation of the aryldiphenylphosphane 6 with elemental iodine and subsequent hydrolysis yielded the aryldiphenyldioxaphosphorane 9&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OH)&#8208;4,4&#8208;Ph2&#8208;3,5&#8208;O2&#8208;2,6&#8208;P2&#8208;4&#955;5&#8208;P&#8208;[5.3.1.0]&#8208;undeca&#8208;1(10),7(11),8&#8208;triene (7). Both of its diastereomers, (RR/SS)&#8208;7 (7a) and (RS/SR)&#8208;7 (7b), were separated as their chloroform and i&#8208;propanol solvates, 7a&#8901;2CHCl3 and 7b&#8901;i&#8208;PrOH, respectively.

         <title>Bola&#8208;Amphiphilic Glycodendrimers: New Carbohydrate&#8208;Mimicking Scaffolds to Target Carbohydrate&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart dumbbell: Innovative bola&#8208;amphiphilic glycodendrimers with mannose and glucose terminals have been designed and synthesized. They demonstrated stronger binding to the carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein ConA than conventional amphiphilic glycodendrimers thanks to their unique dumbbell&#8208;like structure. In addition, these bola&#8208;dendrimers targeted mannose receptors and glucose transporters for effective cellular uptake, and thus hold great promise in carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein&#8208;targeted drug delivery.







Abstract
Dendrimers are appealing scaffolds for creating carbohydrate mimics with unique multivalent cooperativity. We report here novel bola&#8208;amphiphilic glycodendrimers bearing mannose and glucose terminals, and a hydrophobic thioacetal core responsive to reactive oxygen species. The peculiar bola&#8208;amphiphilic feature enabled stronger binding to lectin compared to conventional amphiphiles. In addition, these dendrimers are able to target mannose receptors and glucose transporters expressed at the surface of cells, thus allowing effective and specific cellular uptake. This highlights their great promise for targeted delivery.

         <title>Enhancing the Peroxygenase Activity of a Cofactor&#8208;Independent Peroxyzyme by Directed Evolution Enabling Gram&#8208;Scale Epoxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of the cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme 4&#8208;OT yielded an efficient biocatalyst (fused 4&#8208;OT P8a) for the enantioselective epoxidation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. The optimized peroxyzyme enabled the milligram&#8208; and gram&#8208;scale preparation of the desired &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent conversions and outstanding enantiopurity, providing an attractive route towards the synthesis of valuable intermediates for the production of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Peroxygenases selectively incorporate oxygen into organic molecules making use of the environmentally friendly oxidant H2O2 with water being the sole by&#8208;product. These biocatalysts can provide &#8216;green&#8217; routes for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides, which are fundamental intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals. The peroxyzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), catalysing the epoxidation of a variety of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with H2O2, is outstanding because of its independence from any cost&#8208;intensive cofactor. However, its low&#8208;level peroxygenase activity and the decrease in the enantiomeric excess of the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes under preparative&#8208;scale conditions is limiting the potential of 4&#8208;OT. Herein we report the directed evolution of a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8208;OT variant, which showed an &#8764;150&#8208;fold enhanced peroxygenase activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type, enabling the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes in milligram&#8208; and gram&#8208;scale with high enantiopurity (up to 98&#8201;% ee) and excellent conversions. This engineered cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme can provide new opportunities for the eco&#8208;friendly and practical synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides at large scale.

         <title>Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Responsive Triggers Based on Borinic Acids: Molecular Insights into the Control of Oxidative Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselectivity of H2O2&#8208;triggered oxidation of unsymmetrical diarylborinic acids was assessed. Introducing a CF3 directing group at the ortho&#8208;position relative to the boron atom exclusively provides a unique oxidative rearrangement. This was applied to the synthesis of prototypic fluorogenic probes allowing the complete release of the effector and maintaining superior reactivity compared to boronic acids.







Abstract
Arylborinic acids represent new, efficient, and underexplored hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive triggers. In contrast to boronic acids, two concomitant oxidative rearrangements are involved in the complete oxidation of these species, which might represent a major limitation for an efficient effector (drug or fluorophore) release. Herein, a comprehensive study of H2O2&#8208;mediated unsymmetrical arylborinic acid oxidation to investigate the factors that could selectively guide their oxidative rearrangement is described. The o&#8208;CF3 substituent was found to be an excellent directing group allowing a complete regioselectivity on borinic acid models. This result was successfully applied to synthesizing new borinic acid&#8208;based fluorogenic probes, which exclusively release the fluorescent moiety upon H2O2 treatment. These compounds maintained their superior kinetic properties compared to boronic acids, thus further enhancing the potential of arylborinic acids as valuable new H2O2&#8208;sensitive triggers.

         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Coordinative Chain&#8208;Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (CCTPISA)</title>

Unchaining ways: Ethylene&#8208;coordinative chain&#8208;transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is performed by chain extending poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) living chains in toluene in the presence of ethylene and a Nd&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
Block copolymers based on ethylene (E) and butadiene (B) were prepared using the ansa&#8208;bis(fluorenyl) complex {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 in combination with (n&#8208;Bu)(n&#8208;Oct)Mg (BOMAG) as a chain&#8208;transfer agent. The diblock copolymers incorporating a soft poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) segment, called ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR), and a hard polyethylene (PE) one were obtained by simply adjusting the different feeds of monomers during the polymerization. The soluble EBR block was formed first by feeding the catalytic system dissolved in toluene at 70&#8201;&#176;C with a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (E/B molar ratio 80&#8201;:&#8201;20). Then the feeding was stopped leading to the consumption of a large part of the residual monomers. The reactor was finally fed with ethylene to form the PE block. By varying the molar mass of the latter, it is shown that the resulting soft&#8208;b&#8208;hard block copolymers can self&#8208;assemble simultaneously to the growth of the PE block in agreement with a polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) mechanism. The self&#8208;assembly is discussed considering the reaction conditions, the crystallization of the PE block, and the polymerization mechanism involved.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts has become a resounding topic owing to fundamental interests and potential applications in molten salt reactors and pyroprocessing. This concept paper highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts, which may advance understanding of the nature of molten salt fuels, coolants and electrolytes.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements (lanthanide and actinide) in molten salts has become a resounding topic in view of its great importance to the research and development (R&amp;D) of molten salt reactors and pyroprocessing. In this Review article, a general overview of the coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts is provided including past achievements and recent advances. Particular emphases are placed on the oxidation state, speciation, and solution structure of f&#8208;block metal ions in molten salts, as well as their relationships with the salt composition. Furthermore, this review briefly discusses the spectroscopic and theoretical methods that complement each other in revealing the coordination properties.

         <title>Construction of Photo&#8208;Responsive Pd2L4&#8208;Type Nanocages based on Feringa's Second&#8208;Generation Motor and Its Guest Binding Ability for C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel banana&#8208;shaped and bis&#8208;monodentate ligand based on Feringa's second&#8208;generation molecular motor was designed and synthesized. Subsequently, a M2L4&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic nanocage featuring four endohedral motor motifs was constructed by reacting stoichiometric motor ligand with Pd2+. This motorized nanocage showed good guest encapsulation ability towards C60, offering prospects as a prototype of &#8220;motor factory&#8221; to achieve the motor's non&#8208;equilibrium functions.







Abstract
We present the construction of a M2L4&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic nanocage featuring four endohedral Feringa's motor motifs and its adaptive encapsulation towards a C60 guest molecule. The structure of the cage, though complicated on the 1H NMR spectrum due to the adoption of mixed ligands, was unambiguously characterized with a combination of ESI&#8208;MS, 2D DOSY, 13C NMR and particularly the SAXS technique. The molecular motor within the cage demonstrated similar photophysical properties to the uncoordinated one, indicating the motor's function was not compromised when it was anchored in such a confined nanospace. Furthermore, the nanocage showed good guest encapsulation ability towards C60, and a guest induced&#8208;fit behavior of the cage was revealed based on the extensive SAXS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. The adaptive motorized nanocage reported here represents one of the very few examples of integrating individual motors into a discrete nanoconfined system and offers prospects to achieve its non&#8208;equilibrium functions.

         <title>Indole&#8208;Based Long&#8208;Wavelength Fluorescent Probes for Bioimaging of S&#8208;Nitrosylation in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel indole&#8208;based fluorophore was designed and synthesized, exhibiting long&#8208;wavelength emission and high quantum yield. Functionalization of the 7&#8208;position of the indole ring with an arylphosphine ester resulted with a unique mitochondria&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe for direct detection of S&#8208;nitrosylation within mitochondria of living cells.







Abstract
S&#8208;Nitrosylation has been found to play an important role in regulating mitochondrial function. However, probes for detection of protein S&#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria remain unexplored. Herein, a novel 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl&#8208;substituted indole was designed, exhibiting a long&#8208;wavelength emission and a high fluorescent quantum yield. Functionalization of the 7&#8208;position of the indole ring with an arylphosphine ester resulted with probes with efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability. Furthermore, the indole&#8208;arylphosphine displayed a significant fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to S&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at low micromolar concentrations in A431&#8197;cells. Taken together, this study provides a new indole&#8208;based fluorescent probe with a unique long&#8208;wavelength emission for direct detection of S&#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria, which may represent a powerful tool for understanding the critical roles of S&#8208;nitrosylation within mitochondria of living organisms.

         <title>&#8220;Activated Borane&#8221; &#8211; A Porous Borane Cluster Network as an Effective Adsorbent for Removing Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedented co&#8208;thermolysis of decaborane(14) ( nido &#8208;B 10 H 14 ) and toluene results in a novel porous material (that we have named &#8220;Activated Borane&#8221;) containing micropores 1.0 and 1.5 nm in diameter and a specific surface area of 774 m 2 g &#8208;1 (Ar, 87 K) that is thermally stable up to 1000 &#176;C. Solid&#8208;state 1 H, 11 B and 13 C MAS NMR, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopies suggest an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties in a ratio of about three toluene molecules for every borane cluster. In addition, the structure contains Lewis&#8208;acidic tri&#8208;coordinated boron sites giving it some unique properties. Activated Borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially&#8208;available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make Activated Borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Inert Arenes using a Photochemically Activated Guanidinato&#8208;Magnesium(I) Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UV irradiation of solutions of a guanidinateo dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(Priso)Mg}  2  ]  3  (Priso = [(DipN)  2  CNPr  i  2  ]  &#8208;  ), in either benzene, toluene, xylenes, or mesitylene, leads to activation of an aromatic C&#8210;H bond of the solvent, and formation of aryl/hydride bridged magnesium(II) products, [{(Priso)Mg}  2  (m&#8208;H)(m&#8208;Ar)]  4  &#8208;  9  . These C&#8210;H activations proceed with little regioselectivity, though they are considerably faster. Reaction of  3  with an excess of the pyridine,  p  &#8208;NC  5  H  4  Bu  t  (py  Bu  t  ), gave [(Priso)Mg(py  Bu  t  H)(py  Bu  t  )  2  ]  10  , presumably  via  reduction of the pyridine to yield a radical intermediate, [(Priso)Mg(py  Bu  t  &#183;)(py  Bu  t  )  2  ]  11  , which then abstracts a proton from the reaction solvent or a reactant. DFT calculations imply that the observed arene C&#8210;H activations proceed  via  photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8210;Mg bond of  3  , generating magnesium(I) radicals, (Priso)Mg&#183;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange  via  C&#8210;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species include the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of  3  leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8210;H activation process and formation of an alkyl&#8208;bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(m&#8208;Priso  &#8208;H  )}  2  ]  12  . Furthermore, irradiation of a 1:1 mixture of  3  and the b&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg}  2  ], effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8210;Mg(  Dip  Nacnac)]  13  . Finally, the EPR spectrum (77 K)&#160;of UV irradiated  3  is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a radical species.</dc:description>

Reaction of  3  with an excess of the pyridine,  p  -NC  5  H  4  Bu  t  (py  Bu  t  ), gave [(Priso)Mg(py  Bu  t  H)(py  Bu  t  )  2  ]  10  , presumably  via  reduction of the pyridine to yield a radical intermediate, [(Priso)Mg(py  Bu  t  &#183;)(py  Bu  t  )  2  ]  11  , which then abstracts a proton from the reaction solvent or a reactant. DFT calculations imply that the observed arene C&#8210;H activations proceed  via  photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8210;Mg bond of  3  , generating magnesium(I) radicals, (Priso)Mg&#183;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch-like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange  via  C&#8210;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species include the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of  3  leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8210;H activation process and formation of an alkyl-bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(m-Priso  -H  )}  2  ]  12  . Furthermore, irradiation of a 1:1 mixture of  3  and the b-diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg}  2  ], effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8210;Mg(  Dip  Nacnac)]  13  . Finally, the EPR spectrum (77 K)&#160;of UV irradiated  3  is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a radical species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The sulfur rich fluorothiophosphate dianions [S5P2F2]2&#8208; and [S3PF]2&#8208;: Cluster and chelation control of P&#8208;S Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur rich diphosphate dianion [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  , from fluoride addition to P  4  S  10  , has a somewhat checkered history and proves to be the main product of the reaction in acetonitrile. Its optimized synthesis, and structural characterization, as the tetrapropylammonium salt, [N  n  Pr  4  ]  2  [S  5  P  2  F  2  ] allows for the first coordination chemistry for this dianion. Reactions of [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  with d  10  metal ions of zinc(II), and cadmium(II), and d  9  copper(II) resulted in a surprising diverse array of binding modes and structural motifs. In addition to the simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination of [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  with zinc, cleavage of the P&#8208;S bond resulted in complexes with the unusual [S  3  PF]  2&#8208;  fluorotrithiophosphate dianion. This was observed in two cluster complexes: a trinuclear cadmium complex with mixed [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  /[S  3  PF]  2&#8208;  ligands, [Cd  3  (S  5  P  2  F  2  )  3  (S  3  PF)  2  ]  4&#8208;  as well as an octanuclear copper cluster, [Cu  8  (S  3  PF)  6  ]  4&#8208;  which form rapidly at room temperature. These new metal/sulfur/ligand clusters are of relevance to understanding multimetal binding to metallothionines, and to potential capping strategies for the condensed nanoparticulate cadmium chalcogenide semiconductors CdS and CdSe.</dc:description>

         <title>How Water and Ion Mobility Affect the NMR Fingerprints of the Hydrated JBW Zeolite: a Combined Computational&#8208;Experimental Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An important aspect within zeolite synthesis is to make fully tunable framework materials with controlled aluminium distribution. A major challenge in characterising these zeolites at operating conditions is the presence of water. In this work, we investigate the effect of hydration on the  27  Al NMR parameters of the ultracrystalline K,Na&#8208;compensated aluminosilicate JBW zeolite using experimental and computational techniques. The JBW framework, with Si/Al ratio of 1, is an ideal benchmark system as a stepping stone towards more complicated zeolites. The presence and mobility of water and extraframework species directly affect NMR fingerprints. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained provided dynamic methods are employed with hydrated structural models. This work shows how NMR is instrumental in characterising aluminium distributions in zeolites at operating conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structuresfrom the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene with an Appropriate Oxygen Species as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based graphene with active oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser method. The laser&#8208;induced graphene shows a high catalytic performance in 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reactions to synthesize H2O2 including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1) in alkaline solution, superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. As demonstrated by density function theory simulations, the high catalytic sites are attributed to the meta&#8208;C atoms with charge accumulation at nearby C&#8722;O and O&#8722;C=O species.







Abstract
Oxygen species functionalized graphene (O&#8722;G) is an effective electrocatalyst for electrochemically synthesizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by a 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The type of oxygen species and degree of carbon crystallinity in O&#8722;G are two key factors for the high catalytic performance of the 2 e&#8722; ORR. However, the general preparing method of O&#8722;G by the precursor of graphite has the disadvantages of consuming massive strong oxidant and washing water. Herein, the biomass&#8208;based graphene with tunable oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser. In a flow cell setup, the laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and high mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1), superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density function theory demonstrates the meta&#8208;C atoms at nearby C&#8722;O, O&#8722;C=O species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H2O2 synthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen species functionalized graphene (O&#8722;G) is an effective electrocatalyst for electrochemically synthesizing hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by a 2 e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The type of oxygen species and degree of carbon crystallinity in O&#8722;G are two key factors for the high catalytic performance of the 2 e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR. However, the general preparing method of O&#8722;G by the precursor of graphite has the disadvantages of consuming massive strong oxidant and washing water. Herein, the biomass-based graphene with tunable oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; laser. In a flow cell setup, the laser-induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and high mass activity (814&#8197;mmolg&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), superior to most of the reported carbon-based electrocatalysts. Density function theory demonstrates the meta-C atoms at nearby C&#8722;O, O&#8722;C=O species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
pKa values in non&#8208;aqueous solvents are of critical importance in many areas of chemistry. Our knowledge is, despite their relevance, still limited to the most fundamental properties and few pKa values in the most common solvents. Taking advantage of a recently introduced computationally efficient procedure we computed the pKa values of 182 compounds in 21 solvents. This data set is used to establish for the first time universal trends between all solvents. Our computations indicate, that the total charge of the molecule and the charge of the acidic group combined with the Kamlet&#8208;Taft solvatochromic parameters are sufficient to predict pKa values with at least semi&#8208; quantitative accuracy. We find, that neutral acids such as alcohols are strongly affected by the solvent properties. This is contrasted by cationic acids like ammonium ions whose pKa is often almost completely independent from the choice of solvent.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights about the Ligand&#8208;Enabled Oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of Alkenes via Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the mechanism of the oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of akenes catalyzed by gold. The way alkenols coordinate to (MeDalphos)Au(R&#8217;)2+ (R&#8217;=phenyl, vinyl) was found to significantly depend on their substitution pattern (terminal, Z/E internal) and to play a major role in the 5&#8208;exo/6&#8208;endo regioselectivity.







Abstract
The mechanism of oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of alkenes catalyzed by the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex was comprehensively investigated by DFT. (P,N)Au(Ph)2+ and (P,N)Au(vinyl)2+ are key intermediates accounting for the activation of the alkenols and for their cyclization by outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic attack of oxygen. The 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo paths have been computed and compared, reproducing the peculiar regioselectivity difference observed experimentally between 4&#8208;penten&#8208;1&#8208;ol, (E) and (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ols. Examining the way the alkenol coordinates to gold (more &#951;2 or &#951;1) can offer, in some cases, a simple way to predict the favored path of cyclization.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nano&#8208;Filamentous Zeolite Catalyst to Realize Efficient One&#8208;Step Ethanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile inhibitor&#8208;assisted strategy was developed for constructing nano&#8208;filamentous MOR catalyst, by which to achieve much higher STY of MA than the traditional ES&#8208;MOR catalyst in DME carbonylation [3780&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 1368&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)] and to realize more stable and efficient ethanol synthesis while being combined with an innovative self&#8208;reduced CZ/SiO2 catalyst.







Abstract
The non&#8208;petroleum synthesis route of ethanol from syngas (H2+CO) with methyl acetate (MA) as the core intermediate product has been confirmed as an excellent industrialization route for high purity ethanol production. However, as the central part of this tandem&#8208;catalysis path, the carbonylation of dimethyl ether (DME) to MA is limited by the undesirable catalytic activity and stability of zeolite catalysts. Herein, a facile inhibitor&#8208;assisted strategy was developed for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;Mordenite (nano&#8208;MOR) zeolites without using any expensive or complex template. A nano&#8208;filamentous MOR zeolite with only 70&#8197;nm crystal diameter was successfully synthesized by selectively controlling the crystal growth orientation with a specific inhibitor. The catalytic performance of self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR catalysts was remarkably outstanding in DME carbonylation reaction. The highest Space&#8208;Time Yield (STY) of MA was achieved over Nanofilament MOR (NF&#8208;MOR), which was significantly improved comparing with that of the traditional Ellipsoid&#8208;MOR (ES&#8208;MOR) [3780&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 1368&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)]. One&#8208;step ethanol synthesis was realized by combining the MOR catalyst and an innovative self&#8208;reduced Cu&#8208;ZnO/SiO2 (CZ/SiO2) catalyst in a rationally designed dual&#8208;bed catalysis system. Adopting the tailor&#8208;made NF&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ/SiO2 combination, it obtained the highest STY of ethanol, about 4 times of the conventional ES&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ combination [1800&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 476&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)]. The present self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR zeolites synthetic strategy opens a new way for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance zeolites for practical industrial applications in catalytic conversions of one&#8208;carbon (C1) small molecules to high value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Expanding Catch and Release DNA Decoy (CRDD) Technology with Pyrimidine Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the chemical toolbox: The toolbox of catch and release DNA decoys (CRDDs) has been expanded to pyrimidine mimics. CRDD technology uses photolysis to form abasic sites in DNA. This work shows that a 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) pyrimidine mimic undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond to yield an abasic site at a rate comparable to that of the previously reported 7&#8208;nitroindole (7&#8208;NI) purine mimic.







Abstract
Catch and release DNA decoys (CRDDs) utilize photochemically responsive nucleoside analogues that generate abasic sites upon exposure to light. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of four candidate CRDD monomers containing nucleobases that mimic endogenous pyrimidines: 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;NI), 2&#8208;nitrobenzene (2&#8208;NB), 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) and 3&#8208;nitropyrrole (3&#8208;NP). Our studies reveal that 2&#8208;NI and 2&#8208;NP can function as CRDDs, whereas 3&#8208;NP and 2&#8208;NB undergo decomposition and transformation to a higher&#8208;ordered structure upon photolysis, respectively. When incorporated into DNA, 2&#8208;NP undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond (1.8&#8197;min half&#8208;life) to yield an abasic site. Finally, we find that all four pyrimidine mimics show significantly greater stability when base&#8208;paired against the previously reported 7&#8208;nitroindole CRDD monomer. Our work marks the expansion of CRDD technology to both purine and pyrimidine scaffolds.

Our work marks the expansion of CRDD technology to both purine and pyrimidine scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 2&#8208;aminophenyl pyridines with a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond displays excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, as witnessed by their double emission profile. Their protonation or deprotonation modulates their emission properties, thereby making them promising for pH sensing applications.







Abstract
The dynamic nature of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and its effect on emission spectra is an attractive strategy to create multi&#8208;emissive dyes. Here we describe the behavior of a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded triphenylpyridines with a set of donor&#8211;acceptor combinations that allowed us to perceive the influence of each substitution on the photophysical properties of the dyes. The susceptibility of these ESIPT moieties to pH variations was also studied, elucidating that the level of protonation had a significant effect on the emission color. The assignment of each emission band was made by using DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations that were in agreement with the experimental results. This study emphasizes the versatility of triphenylpyridines that can be synthesized effortlessly with a logical and independent C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 substitution in order to have the desired ESIPT modulation and subsequent multi&#8208;emission response.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in the realization of various functions of human life such as fertilization, immune function, inflammatory response, regeneration process. Inspired by the natural chemotaxis, colloidal motors with chemotactic ability can realize intelligent sense and targeted navigation, which bring a revolutionary method to biomedical applications like precision medicine. However, the application in the biomedical field requires the colloidal motors with submicrometer scale, strong chemotactic ability and clear chemotactic mechanism. In this concept article, we introduce the recent progress of chemotactic colloidal motors, covering the fundamental theory behind experimental advancements. Particularly, the torque&#8208;driven reorientation motion of the submicrometer&#8208;sized colloidal motors during chemotaxis is discussed, and also their underlying mechanism is proposed. With the continuous research on chemotactic colloidal motors, it is believed that the emerging chemotactic colloidal motors will broaden practical applications in the biomedical field.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the magnetic coupling in a Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II) Single Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[{Mn(TPA)I}{UO2 (Mesaldien)}{Mn(TPA)I}]I formula (here TPA = tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine and Mesaldien = N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminomethyl)diethylenebis(salicylidene imine)) reported by Mazzanti and coworkers (Chatelain et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8208;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0 K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g&#8208;factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [U  V  O  2  ]  +  is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g&#8208;factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component J Z twice larger as the perpendicular one J  &#8869;  . The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the J  Z  /J  &#8869;  ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g&#8208;factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding g  S  &#8208;values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8208;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [U  V  O  2  ]  +  5f orbitals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of trifluoroethyl substituted aminomaleimide derivatives are reported with small size and enhanced emissions in both solution and solid&#8208;state. A diCH2CF3 substituted aminochloromaleimide exhibits the most efficient dual&#8208;state emission (&#934;f &gt;50&#8201;% in solution and solid&#8208;state), with reduced quenching from protic solvents. Hence, these dual&#8208;state dyes overcome the limitations of single&#8208;state luminescence and will serve as an important step forward for this rapidly developing field.

         <title>Pyrimidopteridine&#8208;catalyzed Photo&#8208;mediated Hydroacetoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrimidopteridine organic photoredox catalysts are applied in a formal addition of carboxylic acids to activated alkenes as a dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalysts. Electron&#8208;rich alkenes counter the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids upon single&#8208;electron oxidation and a selective hydroacetoxylation is observed.







Abstract
Herein we report a photo&#8208;mediated formal addition of carboxylic acids to activated alkenes catalyzed by a pyrimidopteridine photoredox catalyst. The decarboxylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids upon single&#8208;electron oxidation is countered in the presence of electron&#8208;rich alkenes and a hydroacetoxylation is observed. Mechanistic proposals have been made based on CV measurements, competitive Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching and EPR experiments. Evidence that tetra&#8208;N&#8208;substituted pyrimidopteridines function as dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalyst was supported by spectroscopic means.

         <title>Macroscopic Polarization Change of Mononuclear Valence Tautomeric Cobalt Complexes Through the Use of Enantiopure Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize polarization change in non&#8208;ferroelectric crystals, valence tautomeric (VT) complexes with polar crystal structure were synthesized based on our strategy, i.&#8201;e. introduction of enantiopure ligand into the metal complexes exhibiting intramolecular electron transfer. The VT transition is accompanied by the change in molecular dipole moment. Because the net polarization of the polar crystal never cancels out, polarization switching was realized.







Abstract
The crystallization of a complex having electron transfer properties in a polar space group can induce the polarization switching of a crystal in a specific direction, which is attractive for the development of sensors, memory devices, and capacitors. Unfortunately, the probability of crystallization in a polar space group is usually low. Noticing that enantiopure compounds crystallize in Sohncke space groups, this paper reports a strategy for the molecular design of non&#8208;ferroelectric polarization switching crystals based on the use of intramolecular electron transfer and chirality. In addition, this paper describes the synthesis of a mononuclear valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complex bearing an enantiopure ligand. The introduction of enantiomer enables the crystallization of the complex in the polar space group (P21). The polarization of the crystals along the b&#8208;axis direction is not canceled out and the VT transition is accompanied by a change in the macroscopic polarization of the polar crystal. Polarization switching via electron transfer is realized at around room temperature.

         <title>Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl Derivatives and Related Analogs: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SF6 building blocks: This review article summarizes the recent synthetic methodology dedicated to pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and their related analogs. The properties and up&#8208;to&#8208;date applications in materials sciences and medicinal chemistry of SF5&#8208;containing compounds are also discussed here.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5)&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8722;F, and C&#8722;SF5 bond formation as well as the use of SF5&#8208;containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway&#8208;to&#8208;heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise&#8208;inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago. Herein, we report and evaluate the properties of the SF5 group and analogs, by summarizing synthetic methodologies available to access them as well as following applications in material science and medicinal chemistry since 2015.

         <title>Elastin&#8208;Hyaluronan Bioconjugate as Bioactive Component in Electrospun Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The persistence of &#945;&#8208;helix conformation in a bioactive peptide after the conjugation with hyaluronic acid confirms thiol&#8208;ene chemistry as a successful strategy adopting mild conditions. The electrospun scaffolds showed the double advantage of an improved regularity of nanofiber pattern by hyaluronic acid addition and the presence of a bioactive peptide.







Abstract
Hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan (HA) and elastin&#8208;inspired peptides (EL) have been widely recognized as bioinspired materials useful in biomedical applications. The aim of the present work is the production of electrospun scaffolds as wound dressing materials which would benefit from synergic action of the bioactivity of elastin peptides and the regenerative properties of hyaluronic acid. Taking advantage of thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, a bioactive elastin peptide was successfully conjugated to methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MAHA) and electrospun together with poly&#8208;D,L&#8208;lactide (PDLLA). To the best of our knowledge, limited reports on peptide&#8208;conjugated hyaluronic acid were described in literature, and none of these was employed for the production of electrospun scaffolds. The conformational studies carried out by Circular Dichroism (CD) on the bioconjugated compound confirmed the preservation of secondary structure of the peptide after conjugation while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the supramolecular structure of the electrospun scaffolds. Overall, the study demonstrates that the bioconjugation of hyaluronic acid with the elastin peptide improved the electrospinning processability with improved characteristics in terms of morphology of the final scaffolds.

         <title>Ferroelasticity in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics have got attention due to the superiority of structural adjustment, easy processing, and mechanical flexibility. Recent developments in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics and their crystal structures, phase transitions, and related properties with different dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) are discussed. An outlook on the possible challenges for obtaining hybrid perovskite ferroelastics is also presented.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelastics have received particular attention for potential applications in mechanical switches, shape memory, energy conversion, information processing, and solar cells, by taking advantages of their low&#8208;cost, light&#8208;weight, easy preparation, and mechanical flexibility. The unique structures of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be a design platform for symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;associated order&#8211;disorder in lattice, thereby possessing great potential for ferroelastic phase transition. Herein, we review the research progress of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics in recent years, focusing on the crystal structures, dimensions, phase transitions and ferroelastic properties. In view of the few reports on molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastics, we look forward to the structural design strategies of molecular ferroelastic materials, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastic materials in the future. This review will have positive guiding significance for the synthesis and future exploration of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid molecular ferroelastics.

         <title>Molecular Design of Silicon&#8208;Containing Diazenes: Absorbance of E and Z Isomers in the Near&#8208;Infrared Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bistable structures containing two silicon atoms (with any coordination number: III, IV, V) at the &#8722;N=N&#8722; fragment are characterized by the absorption of E and Z isomers in the near IR region and by a surprising separation of their first bands.







Abstract
The effective use of photochromic systems based on azo compounds in a number of applications, especially biomedical and pharmacological ones, is impeded by the unresolved problem of their E&#8646;Z isomerization in the near&#8208;IR region, NIR (780&#8211;1400&#8197;nm). We have demonstrated at the TD&#8208;DFT, STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD and CASSCF&#8208;NEVPT2 levels of theory that the presence of a silylated diazene core &#8722;Si&#8722;N=N&#8722;Si&#8722; with three&#8208;, tetra&#8208; or five&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms practically guarantees the absorption of the E and Z forms of such derivatives in NIR and the amazing (185&#8211;400&#8197;nm) separation of their first absorption bands. In particular, the maximum &#955;1 of the first n&#8594;&#960;* band of the E isomer of azosilabenzene ASiB is at &#8764;1030&#8197;nm, while for the Z isomer &#955;1&#8773;1340&#8197;nm. Based on the found bistable azo compounds (ASiB, bis(silyl)&#8208; SiD and bis(silatranyl)&#8208; SaD diazenes) and their derivatives with E and Z absorption in NIR, unique photoswitches can be created for a number of applications, in particular, for photothermal therapy.

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120 nm were produced intracellularly with an  Escherichia coli  &#8208;based  in vivo  system. The inCell&#8208;AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the  Lactobacillus brevis  alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the  Bacillus subtilis  glucose&#8208;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell&#8208;AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two&#8208;step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell&#8208;AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole&#8208;cell flow&#8208;biocatalysis, where flow reactors could be operated for &gt;4 days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell&#8208;AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one&#8208;step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Photocatalytic [2 + 2] Cycloaddition Reaction Using Redox&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of photocatalytic processes is important for a sustainable society. The electron transfer process is the key to the photocatalytic process. Herein, we focused on titanium dioxide photocatalyzed organic synthesis and designed a new [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction based on the electron transfer process. Electron transfer not only between the substrate and the photocatalyst but also inter&#8208; and intramolecularly, is an important consideration for reaction design. Radical cations were generated by the photocatalyst and trapped by alkenes. The resultant cyclobutyl radical cations were immediately reduced by the aryl rings via intramolecular electron transfer to obtain cyclobutane rings. The outcome of the reaction was controlled by substitution of the aryl ring and the linker connecting the aryl ring to the enol ether. Carefully&#8208;designed substrates were highly effective for photocatalytic cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

Treatment of  1  &#8208;  3  with NaPF  6  in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF  6  (PP = dppp (  1a  ), (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;Skewphos (  2a  ) and (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;Skewphos (  3a  )). Reaction of [RuCl  2  (PPh  3  )  3  ] with (  S  ,  R  )&#8208;Josiphos or (  R  )&#8208;BINAP in toluene, followed by treatment with tpy in 1&#8208;butanol and finally with NaPF  6  in MeOH gives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF  6  (PP = (  S  ,  R  )&#8208;Josiphos (  4a  ), (  R  )&#8208;BINAP (  5a  )) isolated in 78 and 86% yield, respectively. The chiral derivatives have been isolated as single stereoisomers and  3a  ,  4a  have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The tpy complexes with NaO  i  Pr display high photocatalytic activity in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of carbonyl compounds using 2&#8208;propanol as the only hydrogen donor and visible light at 30 &#176;C, at remarkably high S/C (up to 5000) and TOF values up to 264 h  &#8208;1  .

         <dc:description>An unprecedented, Brookhart&#8217;s acid catalyzed temperature switchable regioselective divergent approach for  N  &#8208;alkylation of arylamines and heterocyclic amines by utilising cyclopropylcarbinols is presented herein. The reaction offers  N  &#8208;alkylated cyclopropyl derivatives and homoallyl amines by employing 2.5 mol% catalyst loading at different temperatures in excellent regioselectivity and yields. This method has shown to be relevant with a wide range of cyclopropylcarbinols, including aliphatic ones. Several control experiments and spectroscopic studies have been performed to gain insight into the reaction mechanism. Further, the synthetic utility of the protocol has also been described.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;ligand Co&#8208;assembled 2D Au(I)&#8208;Thiolate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Au(I)&#8208;thiolate (AT) assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which show promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co&#8208;assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1&#8208;thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co&#8208;assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self&#8208;assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co&#8208;assembled by reacting with HAuCl  4  together to obtain three&#8208;ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co&#8208;assembly are also revealed by comparing single&#8208; and three&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co&#8208;assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely&#8208;packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and pave the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cycloaddition reaction of CO  2  and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. Herein, a new type of catalysts SBA&#8208;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction was synthesized. The different amount of ionic liquid was added into SBA&#8208;15 by the post&#8208;grafting method, by which ionic liquid can be grafted into pore channel restrictively. SBA&#8208;Mn (0.2) (0.2 represented that the amount of ionic liquid is 0.2 mmol) with metal and halogen active sites into the pore channel showed high PC (propylene carbonate) yields and selectivity for five different epoxides at 90 &#176;C. Notably, SBA&#8208;Mn (0.2) has been demonstrated to maintain its catalytic activity and stability for over six cycles. Besides, we proposed a reaction mechanism for cycloaddition of CO  2  with epoxides by density&#8208;functional theory, showing that the metal was coordinated to oxygen atom of epoxide, and the halogen attacked the &#946; carbon of epoxide. Moreover, the theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy shows great potential for CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Coupling Reactions of Dinitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Mediated by Monometallic YB1&#8722;4&#8722; Anions: Carbon&#8722;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed coupling to form C&#8722;N bonds is significant in chemical science. However, the inert nature of N  2  and CO  2  renders their coupling quite challenging. Herein, we report the activation of dinitrogen in the mild plasma atmosphere by the gas&#8208;phase monometallic YB  1&#8722;4  &#8722;  anions and further coupling of CO  2  to form C&#8722;N bonds by using mass spectrometry and theoretical calculation. The observed product anions are NCNBO  &#8722;  and N(BO)  2  &#8722;  , accompanied by the formation of neutral products YO and YB  0&#8722;2  NC, respectively. We can tune the reactivity and the type of products by manipulating the number of B atoms. The B atoms in YB  1&#8722;4  N  2  &#8722;  act as electron donors in CO  2  reduction reactions, and the carbon atom originating from CO  2  serves as an electron reservoir. This is the first example of gas&#8208;phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N  2  with CO  2  &#160;through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Intramolecular C&#8722;H aminations via Engineered Heme Proteins: Full Reaction Pathways and Axial Ligand Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides the complete reaction pathway and axial ligand effect for heme protein catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H aminations. Results reproduced experimentally found rate&#8208;determining step and axial ligand trend and revealed the electronic driving force information to understand them. New ideas for biocatalyst design in this field were offered.







Abstract
Engineered heme protein biocatalysts provide an efficient and sustainable approach to develop amine&#8208;containing compounds through C&#8722;H amination. A quantum chemical study to reveal the complete heme catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H amination pathway and protein axial ligand effect was reported, using reactions of an experimentally used arylsulfonylazide with hemes containing L=none, SH&#8722;, MeO&#8722;, and MeOH to simulate no axial ligand, negatively charged Cys and Ser ligands, and a neutral ligand for comparison. Nitrene formation was found as the overall rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) and the catalyst with Ser ligand has the best reactivity, consistent with experimental reports. Both RDS and non&#8208;RDS (nitrene transfer) transition states follow the barrier trend of MeO&#8722;&lt;SH&#8722;&lt;MeOH&lt;None due to the charge donation capability of the axial ligand to influence the key charge transfer process as the electronic driving forces. Results also provide new ideas for future biocatalyst design with enhanced reactivities.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to HCOOH over Bismuth&#8208;Based Bromide Perovskites in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 reduction: Bismuth&#8208;based perovskites are utilized for CO2RR into formic acid in strong acid for the first time. The ingenious use of acidic electrolyte not only helps to stabilize the perovskite phase, but also enhances CO2 reduction rate, maintains a high OCHO* intermediate coverage and suppresses HER by avoiding the OH&#8722; and carbonate formation, addressing the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221; in CO2RR.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites, primarily used as optoelectronic devices, have not been applied for electrochemical conversion due to their insufficient stability in moisture. Herein, two bismuth&#8208;based perovskites are introduced as novel electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into HCOOH in aqueous acidic media (pH&#8197;2.5), exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH of &gt;80&#8201;% in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.25&#8197;V. Their structural evolution against water was dynamically monitored by in&#8197;situ spectra. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the formation of intermediate OCHO* on bismuth sites of Cs3Bi2Br9(111) play a pivotal role toward HCOOH production, which has a lower energy barrier than that on Cs2AgBiBr6(001) surfaces. Significantly, CO2 reacts with protons instead of water which can enhance CO2 reduction rate and suppress hydrogen evolution by avoiding carbonate formation in acidic electrolytes. This work paves the way for the extensive investigation of halide perovskites in aqueous systems.

         <title>In situ Grignard Metalation Method, Part II: Scope of the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Organocalcium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method is a powerful tool for the synthesis of Ca(hmds)2. Steric hindrance and side reactions occasionally prevent a straightforward application of this strategy but in these cases stoichiometric metalation reactions offer a way out.







Abstract
The in&#8197;situ Grignard Metalation Method (iGMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot strategy to synthesize alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides in multi&#8208;gram scale with high yields via addition of bromoethane to an ethereal suspension of a primary or secondary amine and magnesium (Part&#8197;I) or calcium (Part&#8197;II). This method is highly advantageous because no activation of calcium is required prior to the reaction. Contrary to the magnesium&#8208;based iGMM, there are some limitations, the most conspicuous one is the large influence of steric factors. The preparation of Ca(hmds)2 succeeds smoothly within a few hours with excellent yields opening the opportunity to prepare large amounts of this reagent. Side reactions and transfer of the iGMM to substituted anilines and N&#8208;heterocycles as well as other H&#8208;acidic substrates such as cyclopentadienes are studied. Bulky amidines cannot be converted directly to calcium amidinates via the iGMM but stoichiometric calciation with Ca(hmds)2 enables their preparation.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in the Ionothermal Synthesis for Nucleation of Crystalline Potassium Poly (heptazine imide) Towards an Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of NH4Cl in the eutectic salt mixture of KCl/LiCl can regulate the polymerization process and generate a potassium poly(heptazine imide) framework with favorable features, such as increased surface area, strengthened reduction power, improved exciton dissociation and charge migration properties, which contribute to a significantly boosted catalytic performance in photo&#8208;production of hydrogen peroxide from selective oxygen reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven selective oxygen reduction reaction on polymeric carbon nitride framework is one of the most promising approaches toward sustainable H2O2 production. Potassium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), with regular metal sites in the framework and favorable crystalline structure, is highly active for photocatalytic selective 2e oxygen reduction to produce H2O2. By introducing NH4Cl into the eutectic KCl&#8208;LiCl salt mixture, the PHI framework exhibits a remarkable performance for photocatalytic production of H2O2, for example, a record high H2O2 photo&#8208;production rate of 29.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1. The efficient photocatalytic performance is attributed to the favorable properties of the new PHI framework, such as improved porosity, negatively shifted LUMO position, enhanced exciton dissociation and charges migration properties. A mechanistic investigation by quenching and electron spin resonance technique reveals the critical role of superoxide radicals for the formation singlet oxygen, and the singlet oxygen is one of the critical intermediates towards the formation of the H2O2 by proton extraction from the ethanol.

         <title>A Formylglycine&#8208;Peptide for the Site&#8208;Directed Identification of Phosphotyrosine&#8208;Mimetic Fragments

Site&#8208;directed screening? Formylglycine (red) is a reactive amino acid that can be utilized in fragment ligation assays. Incorporated into a site&#8208;directing hexapeptide it can effectively probe the active site of PTP1B, yielding new phosphotyrosine mimetics derived from different nucleophiles, such as aryl amines (green).







Abstract
Discovery of protein&#8208;binding fragments for precisely defined binding sites is an unmet challenge to date. Herein, formylglycine is investigated as a molecular probe for the sensitive detection of fragments binding to a spatially defined protein site . Formylglycine peptide 3 was derived from a phosphotyrosine&#8208;containing peptide substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by replacing the phosphorylated amino acid with the reactive electrophile. Fragment ligation with formylglycine occurred in&#8197;situ in aqueous physiological buffer. Structures and kinetics were validated by NMR spectroscopy. Screening and hit validation revealed fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated hit fragments being able to replace the native phosphotyrosine residue. The formylglycine probe identified low&#8208;affinity fragments with high spatial resolution as substantiated by molecular modelling. The best fragment hit, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl&#8208;acetic acid, was converted into a cellularly active, nanomolar inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.

         <title>Construction of C&#8208;N Atropisomers by Aminocatalytic Enantioselective Addition of Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to o&#8208;Quinone Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
You (don't) spin me right &#8216;round, baby, right &#8216;round. A new organocatalytic atroposelective method for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The newly developed F&#8208;substituted aminocatalyst, with an increased outer&#8208;sphere steric control, enables the atroposelective formation of the desired product, which feature interesting biological motifs.







Abstract
The first atroposelective aminocatalytic methodology for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The synthesis of this class of axially chiral molecules typically encompasses substrates in which the C&#8722;N bond is pre&#8208;formed. In contrast, this work presents the direct coupling of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to ortho&#8208;quinones, to form the stereogenic C&#8722;N axis in an atroposelective way. Application of typical secondary amine catalysts furnished the desired product, however, in low yields and as a complex mixture arising from poor regiocontrol among the C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;sites of the indole core. A new aminocatalyst was designed and synthesized with increased outer&#8208;sphere steric bulk to address these challenges thereby providing good levels of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A novel library of functionalized and enantioenriched C&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained and their synthetic utility was demonstrated by various transformations.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Ni(0) and Ni(II) Complexes of Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene (MeBICAAC): Catalytic Activity and Mechanistic Insights in Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A wide range of aryl halides were coupled with phenylzinc bromides in Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction catalyzed by MeBICAAC&#8208;nickel complexes. The active species are deciphered by means of UV&#8208;vis, HRMS and NMR measurements and support the involvement of Ni(I)/Ni(III) species in the reaction promoted by [(MeBICAAC)2NiIICl2] pre&#8208;catalyst whereas, Ni(0)/Ni(II) cycle operates when the Ni(0) complex, [(MeBICAAC)2Ni0] was used as pre&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of organozinc compounds as nucleophiles with aryl halides has drawn immense focus for C&#8722;C bond formation reactions. In comparison to the well&#8208;established library of Pd complexes, the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling of this particular approach is largely primitive with nickel&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe the syntheses of Ni(II) complexes, [(MeBICAAC)2NiX2] (X=Cl (1), Br (2), and I (3)) by employing the bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (MeBICAAC) ligand. The reduction of complexes 1&#8211;3 using KC8 afforded the two coordinate low valent, Ni(0) complex, [(MeBICAAC)2Ni(0)] (4). Complexes 1&#8211;4 have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and their solid&#8208;state structures were also confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, complexes 1&#8211;4 have been applied in a direct and convenient method to catalyze the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of various aryl halides with 2,6&#8208;difluorophenylzinc bromide or phenylzinc bromide as the coupling partner in the presence of 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst. Comparatively, among all&#8208;pristine complexes, 1 exhibit high catalytic potential to afford value&#8208;added C&#8722;C coupled products without the use of any additive. The UV&#8208;vis studies and HRMS measurements of controlled stochiometric reactions vindicate the involvement of Ni(I)&#8722;NI(III) cycle featured with a penta&#8208;coordinated Ni(III)&#8208;aryl species as the key intermediate for 1 whereas Ni(0)/Ni(II) species are potentially involved in the catalytic cycle of 4.

Notably, b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with the lowest overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V and Tafel slop of 241&#8197;mV/dec at pH&#8197;11. Mechanism studies indicate that the formation of dimer complex at pH&#8197;11 could generate O&#8722;O bond via redox isomerization, resulting in low overpotential for efficient water oxidation.







Abstract
Since the water oxidation half&#8208;reaction requires the transfer of multi&#8208;electrons and the formation of O&#8722;O bond, it's crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si, b&#8208;Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5 VRHE at pH&#8197;11.0, which is dramatically improved from the b&#8208;Si photoanode (1.03&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2) and f&#8208;Si photoanode (0.0087&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Mechanism studies demonstrate that b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light&#8208;harvesting, interfacial charge&#8208;transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly, b&#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241&#8197;mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V at pH&#8197;11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH &#8764;11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl&#8208;complex could form O&#8722;O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Multistep Continuous Flow Synthesis of Isolable NH2&#8208;Sulfinamidines via Nucleophilic Addition to Transient Sulfurdiimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, are neglected S(IV) compounds. We report here the first synthesis of isolable NH2&#8208;sulfinamidines through a multistep continuous flow approach via addition of organometallics to a transient sulfurdiimide. The transformation is highly chemoselective and compatible with a variety of in&#8197;situ generated organolithiums. Further manipulation of the products gives access to unexplored S(IV) aza&#8208;analogues of pharmaceutically relevant targets.







Abstract
The growing interest in novel sulfur pharmacophores led to recent advances in the synthesis of some S(IV) and S(VI) motifs. However, preparation and isolation of uncommon primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, is highly desirable. Here we report a multistep continuous flow synthesis of poorly explored NH2&#8208;sulfinamidines by nucleophilic attack of organometallic reagents to in&#8197;situ prepared N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;N&#8208;trityl&#8208;&#955;4&#8208;sulfanediimine (Tr&#8722;N=S=N&#8722;TMS). The transformation can additionally be realized under mild conditions, at room temperature, via a highly chemoselective halogen&#8208;lithium exchange of aryl bromides and iodides with n&#8208;butyllithium. Moreover, the synthetic potential of the methodology was assessed by exploring further manipulations of the products and accessing novel S(IV) analogues of celecoxib, tasisulam, and relevant sulfinimidoylureas.

         <title>Encapsulated Neutral Ruthenium Catalyst for Substrate&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations performed on a neutral ruthenium complex immobilized inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric capsule showed that its formation is enabled by supramolecular interactions between the first coordination sphere of the ruthenium and the aromatic rings of the capsule. Substrate size selectivity was observed when the inclusion complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation of alcohols.







Abstract
The neutral complex dichloro&#8208;{diethyl[(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)&#8208;(4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;methylphenyl)methyl]phosphonate} (p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;ruthenium(II) was encapsulated inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric host obtained upon reaction of 2,8,14,20&#8208;tetra&#8208;undecyl&#8208;resorcin[4]arene and water. The formation of an inclusion complex was inferred from a combination of spectral measurements (MS, UV/Vis spectroscopy, 1H and DOSY NMR). The 31P and 19F NMR spectra are consistent with motions of the ruthenium complex inside the self&#8208;assembled capsule. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out on the inclusion complex confirmed these intra&#8208;cavity movements and highlighted possible supramolecular interactions between the ruthenium first coordination sphere ligands and the inner part (aromatic rings) of the capsule. The embedded ruthenium complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation (using NaIO4 as oxidant) of mixtures of three arylmethyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction kinetics were shown to vary as a function of the substrates&#8217; size, with the oxidation rate varying in the order benzylalcohol &gt;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzylalcohol &gt;9&#8208;anthracenemethanol. Control experiments realized in the absence of hexameric capsule did not allow any discrimination between the substrates.

         <dc:description>
Rhodium complexes bearing a guanidine based NCN pincer ligand were designed and successfully applied to catalytic acrylate synthesis from carbon dioxide and ethylene. The repulsion between p&#960;&#8208;electron of guanidine and filled d&#960; orbital of Rh center increases the electron density on Rh, allowing the first structural characterization of rhodalactone formation.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed acrylate synthesis from CO2 and ethylene was accomplished by using a guanidine&#8208;based NCN pincer ligand. The repulsion between p&#960;&#8208;electron of guanidine sidearms and occupied d&#960; orbital of rhodium center raised the level of d&#8208;electrons close to those of formerly known d8&#8208;ruthenium catalyst, thereby promoting the metallalactone formation from carbon dioxide and ethylene. This work fills the absence of group&#8208;9 metal based catalyst for the acrylate synthesis and provides a designing approach for pincer&#8208;ligated d8&#8208;metal catalysts to utilize p&#960;&#8208;d&#960; interaction for promoting desirable redox processes.

         <title>Cu3(HHTP)2 c&#8208;MOF/ZnO Ultrafast Ultraviolet Photodetector for Wearable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2 A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1 V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self&#8208;powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70 &#956;s, which is the record value for MOF&#8208;based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000&#8208;time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF&#8208;based UV photodetector with anti&#8208;fatigue and anti&#8208;bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional conductive metal-organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c-MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type-II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2 A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1 V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self-powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70 &#956;s, which is the record value for MOF-based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000-time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF-based UV photodetector with anti-fatigue and anti-bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Insights on the Influence of Organic Co&#8208;solvent on Structural and Catalytic Properties of a Biocatalyst: Inhibitory Effect of DMSO on Halohydrin Dehalogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the application of organic solvents in biocatalysis is well explored, in&#8208;depth understanding of solvent interactions with proteins, in particular oligomeric ones, is still scant. Understanding of these interactions is essential in tailoring enzymes for industrially relevant catalysis in nonaqueous media. In our study, homotetrameric enzyme halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from  Agrobacterium radiobacter  AD1 (HheC) was investigated, as a model system, in DMSO&#8208;water solvent mixtures. DMSO, the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent for biocatalytic transformations, was found to act as a mixed&#8208;type inhibitor with a prevalent competitive contribution. Already 5% (v/v) DMSO inhibits the activity of HheC by half. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that DMSO keeps close to Ser&#8208;Tyr catalytic residues forming alternate H&#8208;bonds with them. Stability measurements paired with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS) methods and MD studies revealed that HheC conserves structural integrity in content as high as 30% (v/v) DMSO.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding materials properties. This characteristic relies on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN 6 octahedra frameworks being particularly intriguing. In this study, the phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen system was studied up to 137 GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 and PN 2 were found to form at 72 and 134 GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN 6 units. The two are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K 0 = 322 GPa for &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 and of K 0 = 339 GPa for PN 2 . Upon decompression below 7 GPa, &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P 3 N 5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN 4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P 3 N 5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through high&#8208;pressure formed phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Metal and Ligand Reactive Sites for One Pot Reactions: Ligand&#8208;Centered Borenium Ions for Tandem Catalysis with Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem catalysts that perform two different organic transformations in a single pot are highly desirable because they enable rapid and efficient assembly of simple organic building blocks into more complex molecules. Many examples of tandem catalysis rely on metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving one or more metal complexes. Remarkably, despite surging interest in the development of chemically reactive (i.e. noninnocent) ligands, there are few examples of metal complexes that leverage ligand&#8208;centered reactivity to perform catalytic reactions in tandem with separate catalytic reactions at the metal. Here we report how multifunctional Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;derived diphosphorus ligands, called TBDPhos, appear to facilitate borenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reactions at the ligand, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions at the metal. Both transformations can be accessed in one pot to afford rare examples of tandem catalysis using separate metal and ligand catalysis sites in a single complex.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith Reaction: History, Strategies, and Synthetic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical ring rearrangements (RRR): The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals, is an important strategy in organic synthesis to rapidly access medium&#8208;sized rings that are present in several natural products and valuable pharmaceutical compounds. This Review article discusses the origin and advancement of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction with particular focus on its application to complex natural products synthesis.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;expansion strategies are valuable synthetic tools that take benefit of existing ring structures and evade the unfavorable enthalpic&#8208;and entropic effects that arise with end&#8208;to&#8208;end cyclizations. One potentially important class of such reactions is the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, the ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals. The exciting advancement in this research area is starting to show its potential, as demonstrated by applying this methodology in strategy&#8208;level bond formation to synthesize complex natural products. This Review aims to provide the first comprehensive survey of the development of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction spanning three decades from the initial report to the present day, thus providing the readers with great detail about the contributions of this reaction to organic synthesis. We hope that this review will further disclose the salient features of the Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction for synthetic applications and encourage the development of new, more advanced applications.

         <title>An Iodide&#8208;Mediated Anodic Amide Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and robust methodology towards a direct condensation of carboxylic acids and amines has been realized in a versatile electrochemical approach, using a combination of triphenylphosphine and iodide as coupling reagent. A broad scope of different amides and dipeptides were accessible by the presented method, without the need for pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting materials.







Abstract
The ubiquity of amide bonds, present in natural products and common pharmaceuticals renders this functional group one of the most prevalent in organic chemistry. Despite its importance and a wide variety of existing methods for its formation, the latter still can be a challenge for classical activating reagents such as chloridating agents or carbodiimides. As the spent reagents often cannot be recycled, the development of more sustainable methods is highly desirable. Herein, we report an operationally simple and mild indirect electrochemical protocol to effect the condensation of carboxylic acids with amines, forming a wide variety of carboxamides.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Recognition by DARPIns through Epitope/Paratope Analogy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DARPins are proteins able to specifically recognize G&#8208;quadruplexes. Their small size combined with their easy design makes them a good competitor to antibodies for the identification and localization of G&#8208;quadruplex. Using molecular dynamics calculations, we show that the selectivity of DARPins towards G&#8208;quadruplexes is achieved by the recognition of a structural motif adopted by the DNA filament folding.







Abstract
We investigated the mechanisms leading to the specific recognition of Guanine Guadruplex (G4) by DARPins peptides, which can lead to the design of G4&#8197;s specific sensors. To this end we carried out all&#8208;atom molecular dynamic simulations to unravel the interactions between specific nucleic acids, including human&#8208;telomeric (h&#8208;telo), Bcl&#8208;2, and c&#8208;Myc, with different peptides, forming a DARPin/G4 complex. By comparing the sequences of DARPin with that of a peptide known for its high affinity for c&#8208;Myc, we show that the recognition cannot be ascribed to sequence similarity but, instead, depends on the complementarity between the three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of the molecular fragments involved: the &#945;&#8208;helix/loops domain of DARPin and the G4 backbone. Our results reveal that DARPins tertiary structure presents a charged hollow region in which G4 can be hosted, thus the more complementary the structural shapes, the more stable the interaction.

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Targeting Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Photodynamic Molecular Beacon for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photodynamic molecular beacon has been designed and synthesized, which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton which is activatable by the coexistence of glutathione and cathepsin B. It serves as a tumor&#8208;targeting and dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photosensitizer for precise photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
A multifunctional photodynamic molecular beacon (PMB) has been designed and synthesized which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton in which the three zinc(II) phthalocyanine units are each substituted with a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) quencher and are linked via two cathepsin B&#8208;cleavable GFLG peptide chains. This tailor&#8208;made conjugate is fully quenched in the native form due to the photoinduced electron transfer effect of the DNBS moieties and the self&#8208;quenching of the phthalocyanine units. It can target the EGFR overexpressed in cancer cells, and after receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, it can be activated selectively by the co&#8208;existence of intracellular GSH and cathepsin B, both of which are also overproduced in cancer cells, in terms of fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation. The cell&#8208;selective behavior of this PMB has been demonstrated using a range of cancer cells with different expression levels of EGFR, while the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been studied both in&#8197;vitro and in various aqueous media. The overall results show that this advanced PMB, which exhibits several levels of control of the tumor specificity, is a promising photosensitizer for precise antitumoral photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Bonding Situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H Complexes in Transition Metal and Main Group Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controversial bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E=Si, B) complexes in transition metal and main&#8208;group compounds is quantitatively analyzed by means of computational tools. This study sheds light on the crucial role of backdonation to determine the possible &#951;1 or &#951;2 coordination modes.







Abstract
The ambiguous bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E=Si, B) complexes in transition metal compounds has been rationalized by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, the combination of the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) method and its Natural Orbital for Chemical Valance (NOCV) extension has been applied to representative complexes described in the literature where the possible &#951;1 versus &#951;2 coordination mode is not unambiguously defined. Our quantitative analyses, which complement previous data based on the application of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approach, indicate that there exists a continuum between genuine &#951;1 and &#951;2 modes depending mainly on the strength of the backdonation. Finally, we also applied this EDA&#8208;NOCV approach to related main&#8208;group species where the backdonation is minimal.

         <title>One Fluorophore&#8208;Two Sensing Films: Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Directed Formation of a Quadruple Perylene Bisimide Stack</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;one fluorophore&#8208;two sensing films&#8221; is realized based on a typically designed perylene bisimide dimer, HDPP&#8208;PBI, which shows strong tendency to form quadruple PBI aggregate via dimerization in suitable solvents owing to synergistic effect between intramolecular hydrogen bond formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Transition from fluorescence silent HDPP&#8208;PBI dimer to fluorescence bright monomer is realized via addition of CF3COOH.







Abstract
Elaborately designed &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular aggregates are significant for modulation of photophysical properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Herein, a double hydrogen&#8208;bonds trussed di(pyridyl)pyrrole&#8208;perylene bisimide (HDPP&#8208;PBI) was designed and its dimerization behavior was studied. HDPP&#8208;PBI tends to form a quadruple PBI stack with a dimerization constant of &#8764;5.56&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The dimerization was ascribed to synergistic intramolecular double hydrogen&#8208;bonds formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Addition of CF3COOH, a hydrogen bond blocker, promotes the dimer to monomer transition. Accordingly, two distinct fluorescent films were prepared by drop&#8208;casting of the dimerized or the monomeric HDPP&#8208;PBI onto a substrate surface. Interestingly, the less&#8208;emissive PBI quadruple stack&#8208;based film showed a turn on response to acetone vapor, while the highly emissive HDPP&#8208;PBI&#8208;based film exhibited fluorescence quenching upon exposure to triethylamine vapor. We believe that the discovered synergistic effect in the PBI aggregates would enlighten the design of new PAHs aggregates with defined structures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A unique&lt;/b&gt; &#8220;one fluorophore-two sensing films&#8221; is realized based on a typically designed perylene bisimide dimer, HDPP-PBI, which shows strong tendency to form quadruple PBI aggregate via dimerization in suitable solvents owing to synergistic effect between intramolecular hydrogen bond formation and intermolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking. Transition from fluorescence silent HDPP-PBI dimer to fluorescence bright monomer is realized via addition of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaborately designed &#960;-stacked molecular aggregates are significant for modulation of photophysical properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Herein, a double hydrogen-bonds trussed di(pyridyl)pyrrole-perylene bisimide (HDPP-PBI) was designed and its dimerization behavior was studied. HDPP-PBI tends to form a quadruple PBI stack with a dimerization constant of &#8764;5.56&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The dimerization was ascribed to synergistic intramolecular double hydrogen-bonds formation and intermolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking. Addition of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, a hydrogen bond blocker, promotes the dimer to monomer transition. Accordingly, two distinct fluorescent films were prepared by drop-casting of the dimerized or the monomeric HDPP-PBI onto a substrate surface. Interestingly, the less-emissive PBI quadruple stack-based film showed a turn on response to acetone vapor, while the highly emissive HDPP-PBI-based film exhibited fluorescence quenching upon exposure to triethylamine vapor. We believe that the discovered synergistic effect in the PBI aggregates would enlighten the design of new PAHs aggregates with defined structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure of Zinc and Nickel Histidine Complexes in Solution Revealed by Molecular Dynamics and Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman optical activity (ROA) is rarely applied to metals because of the complexity of the spectra. However, herein, it was possible to analyze model zinc and nickel compounds and determine prevalent trends in the structure. Correct interpretation of the spectra opens a way to application of this kind of spectroscopy to biologically relevant systems in the natural aqueous environment.







Abstract
The histidine residue has an exceptional affinity for metals, but solution structure of its complexes are difficult to study. For zinc and nickel complexes, Raman and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopy methods to investigate the link between spectral shapes and the geometry were used. The spectra were recorded and interpreted on the basis of ionic equilibria, molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory. For zwitterionic histidine the dominant tautomer was determined by the decomposition of experimental spectra into calculated subspectra. An octahedral structure was found to prevail for the ZnHis2 complex in solution, in contrast to a tetrahedral arrangement in the crystal phase. The solution geometry of NiHis2 is more similar to the octahedral structure found by X&#8208;ray. The Raman and ROA structural determinations of metal complexes are dependent on extensive computations, but reveal unique information about the studied systems.

         <title>Reversible Oxidative Addition of Zinc Hydride at a Gallium(I)&#8208;Centre: Labile Mono&#8208; and Bis(hydridogallyl)zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc dihydride reacts with a gallium(I) reagent by reversible oxidative addition to provide di&#8208; and trimetallic hydridogallyl zinc complexes. The position of oxidative addition&#8208;reductive elimination equilibria can be controlled by coordination/decoordination of TMEDA.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), partially deaggregated zinc dihydride as hydrocarbon suspensions react with the gallium(I) compound [(BDI)Ga] (I, BDI={HC(C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3))2}&#8722;) by formal oxidative addition of a Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centre. Dissociation of the labile TMEDA ligand in the resulting complex [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (1) facilitates insertion of a second equiv. of I into the remaining Zn&#8722;H to form a thermally sensitive trinuclear species [{(BDI)Ga(H)}2Zn] (2). Compound 1 exchanges with polymeric zinc dideuteride [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA, and with compounds I and 2 via sequential and reversible ligand dissociation and gallium(I) insertion. Spectroscopic and computational studies demonstrate the reversibility of oxidative addition of each Zn&#8722;H bond to the gallium(I) centres.

Partial ligand substitution in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 through solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange by BDC enhances the photo&#8208;generated charge separation, which promotes the hydrogen production rate under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times higher hydrogen production rate compared to the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This work broadens the field of ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Conjugated Dienes: Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of Piperazines and 2&#8208;Piperazinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of conjugated dienes has been developed using ethanediamine and &#945;&#8208;amino amide derivatives as nitrogen sources respectively. A variety of valuable substituted piperazines and 2&#8208;piperazinones were synthesized in good yields and with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Dinitrogen heterocycles are among the most important molecular structures, and the synthesis of these types of structures through intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins is a direct and efficient method. However, the types of nitrogen sources are mostly derived from ureas or arylamines, and nitrogen sources from aliphatic amines are still limited due to their distinct electronic and steric effects. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of conjugated dienes, using ethanediamine and &#945;&#8208;amino amide derivatives as nitrogen sources respectively, for the synthesis of piperazines and 2&#8208;piperazinones in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities.

         <title>Discovery of Complex Binding and Reaction Mechanisms from Ternary Gases in Rare Earth Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) calculations were carried out for H2O, NO2 and SO2 gas mixtures in rare earth (Y, Eu, Tb and Yb) 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterepthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. The results reveal formation of secondary gases inside the MOF pore and the identification of four unique adsorption sites.







Abstract
Understanding the selectivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to complex acid gas streams will enable their use in industrial applications. Herein, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) were used to simulate ternary gas mixtures (H2O&#8208;NO2&#8208;SO2)&#160;in rare earth 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. Stronger H2O gas&#8208;metal binding arose from thermal vibrations in the MOF sterically hindering access of SO2 and NO2 molecules to the metal sites. Gas&#8208;gas and gas&#8208;linker interactions within the MOF framework resulted in the formation of multiple secondary gas species including HONO, HNO2, NOSO, and HNO3&#8722;. Four gas adsorption sites were identified along with a new de&#8208;protonation reaction mechanism not observable through experiment. This study not only provides valuable information on competitive gas binding energies in the MOF, it also provides important chemical insights into transient chemical reactions and mechanisms.

         <title>Efficient Water Cleaning by Self&#8208;standing Carbon Nitride Films Derived from Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;standing carbon nitride films were prepared by drying and calcinating tailored supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and 4&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid. The resulting self&#8208;standing films were employed as filters combining adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants showing remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions.







Abstract
The design of efficient self&#8208;standing hybrid systems for water purification that combines good adsorption properties with high photodegradation ability is highly challenging owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the band structure and porosity of a semiconductor while maintaining its self&#8208;standing nature. Here, we report the synthesis of carbon&#8208;rich carbon nitride self&#8208;standing filters from supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and cyanobenzoic acid. The influence of the chemical structure on the properties of the hydrogels and the final films was studied by tuning parameters such as monomer nature, molar ratio, and pyrolysis temperature. Thanks to their ability to combine the adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants, the prepared self&#8208;standing films showed remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions (&gt;95&#8201;% efficiency after 10&#8197;consecutive cycles). Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of the films was assessed in the powder form for the hydrogen evolution reaction and photocurrent generation in a photoelectrochemical cell. The reported work opens opportunities for the controlled synthesis of multifunctional filters for water purification and other energy&#8208;related and sustainable technologies.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Variation and Sodium Storage Behavior of Polyoxometalates Encapsulated within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confining polyoxometalates (POMs) in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) influence the electronic structure of POMs. Electron transfer occurs not only between POMs and SWNTs, but also within a single POM cluster. Consequently, charge density on the bridged oxygen of POMs is prominently enhanced. The electron reconfiguration of POMs in POMs@SWNT significantly accelerate electron and ion transport, and improve electrochemical Na+ storage performance.







Abstract
The host&#8211;guest interaction can remarkably alter the physiochemical properties of composite materials. It is crucial to clarify the mechanism by revealing the influence of the host on the electronic structure of the guest molecules. Herein, we study the structural variation of polyoxometalates (POMs) after being confined in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). What we found is that in addition to the reported charge transfer from SWNT to POM, an intramolecular electron transfer within a single POM cluster can be observed in the POM@SWNT composites. Moreover, the charge density on the bridged oxygen of POMs is prominently enhanced. The structural change and electron reconfiguration of POMs upon encapsulation in SWNT significantly speed up electron and ion transport, leading to the improved electrochemical performance for sodium ions storage.

         <title>In Situ Ternary Adduct Formation of Yttrium Polyaminocarboxylates Leads to Small Molecule Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8197;situ formation of ternary adducts of yttrium(III) polyaminocarboxylate complexes with the endogenous molecules pyruvate, bicarbonate or acetate are investigated using 13C&#8197;NMR, SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised NMR, and DFT. A novel [Y(EDTA)(pyruvate hydrate)(H2O)]2&#8722; adduct is linked to decomposition of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO2 highlighting the potential of these adducts for capture and activation of small molecules.







Abstract
In this work the chemistry of yttrium complexes is exploited for small molecule capture and activation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies were used to investigate the in&#8197;situ formation of solution state ternary yttrium&#8208;acetate, yttrium&#8208;bicarbonate, and yttrium&#8208;pyruvate adducts with a range of polyaminocarboxylate chelates. These studies reveal that [Y(DO3A)(H2O)2] (H3DO3A &#8211; 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;tricarboxylic acid) and [Y(EDTA)(H2O)q]&#8722; (H4EDTA &#8211; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, q = 2 and 3) are able to form ternary adducts with bicarbonate and pyruvate. In the latter, unusual decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO2 was observed and further studied using SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised 13C&#8197;NMR (SABRE &#8211; signal amplification by reversible exchange) to provide information about the reaction timescale and lifetime of intermediates involved in this conversion. The work presented demonstrates that yttrium complexes can capture and activate small molecules, which may lead to novel and useful applications of this metal in catalysis and medical imaging.

         <dc:description>The high&#8208;mortality invasive fungal infections seriously threaten the lives of immunocompromised people. Host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are representative membrane&#8208;active peptides with different functions. Among them, host defense peptides mimicking is a valid strategy in the design of synthetic antifungal agents. Despite the brilliance in the field of intracellular delivery, the potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and their mimics for designing antifungal agents has been overlooked. In this concept article, we describe the structural design of synthetic antifungal polymers as mimics of host defense peptides, and highlight the effectiveness and potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;inspired strategy in designing potent and selective antifungal polymeric agents. In addition, an outlook for further expanding the design horizons of antifungal polymers is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of urease by hydroquinones: a structural and kinetic study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroquinones are a class of organic compounds abundant in nature which result from the full reduction of the corresponding quinones. Quinones are known to efficiently inhibit urease, a Ni(II)&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonate and acts as a virulence factor of several human pathogens, in addition to decreasing the efficiency of soil organic nitrogen fertilization. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the inhibition of urease from  Sporosarcina pasteurii  (SPU) and  Canavalia ensiformis  (jack bean, JBU) by 1,4&#8208;hydroquinone (HQ) and its methyl&#8208; and  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208; derivatives. The 1.63&#8208;&#197; resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the SPU&#8208;HQ complex discloses that HQ covalently binds to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. Inhibition k inetic data obtained for the three compounds on JBU revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>"Crystal memory" affects the properties of peptide hydrogels &#8208; the case of the cyclic Tyr&#8208;Tyr dipeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work a relationship between the crystal form and morphology and rheological properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels is examined. We show, that under favorable circumstances a correlation between a starting solid material and a self&#8208;assembly processes in solution can exist, leading to different properties of a resulting soft matter. This observation, together with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the influence of stereochemistry of self&#8208;assembled (  ll  ) and (  dl  ) Tyr&#8208;Tyr cyclic dipeptides (cYY) on the observed relationship between gelation and crystallization allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the peptide hydrogelation processes at a molecular level, using liquid state NMR, rheological studies and scanning electron microscopy. In the course of our studies, several crystal forms of (  ll  )&#8208;cYY has been discovered and described in details using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as advanced solid state NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction of powders, thermal analysis, FT&#8208;IR, circular dichroism and crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations. Subsequently, we found that while (  ll  )&#8208;cYY easily assembles into hydrogels with different properties depending on the starting solid form, (  dl  )&#8208;cYY always precipitated as one crystal form in the tested conditions. Molecular&#8208;level justification for this observation is given.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Separation by Imide/Imine Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 capture and clean energy production technologies are stirring increasing interest due to the visible effects of global warming on our planet. In the background is a picture of a small lake in Lombardy, Italy, as it appeared in 2018. Novel imide/imine cages have shown promising results in the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. The cages have also been successfully tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. Jansen, M. Carta, V. Amendola et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201631).

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Nucleic Acid Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer&#160;than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiazole Boron Difluoride Dyes with Large Stokes Shift, Solid State Emission and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The small Stokes shift and weak emission in the solid state are two main shortcomings associated with the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) family of dyes. We present herein the design, synthesis and luminescent properties of boron difluoro complexes of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;4&#8208;alkylaminocarbonylthiazoles. &#160;These dyes display&#160; Stokes shifts (&#8710; &#955; ,&#160; 77&#8208;101 nm) with quantum yields (  &#934;  FL  ) up to 64.9 and 34.7% in toluene solution and in solid state, respectively. Some of these compounds exhibit dual fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission properties with modulable phosphorescence quantum yields (  &#934;  PL  ) and lifetime ( &#964;  p  &#160;up to 251&#160; &#956; s). The presence of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and negligible&#160; p &#8208; p &#160;stacking revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure might account for the observed large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission of these fluorophores, while the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of iodine and the self&#8208;assembly driven by halogen bonding,&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; &#160;and C&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#928; &#160;interactions could be responsible for the observed RTP of iodine containing phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Symmetrically &#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazole Incorporating Fluoranthene Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a novel doubly cyclopentannulated carbazole which is accessible through a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of di(1&#8208;naphthylamine). The carbazole moiety is generated in the final step through intramolecular oxidative coupling. The &#960;&#8208;expansion of carbazole resulted in strongly altered optoelectronic and electrochemical properties. The solid&#8208;state structure features an interesting packing motif with alternating face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species via Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Near&#8208;infrared Nanoprobes: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are essential oxidative metabolites of organisms, which are closely related to physiological, pathological and pharmacological processes. The accurate detection of ROS/RNS is important for the understanding of biological processes, monitoring of pharmacological effects, and predicting the course of disease. The recently developed NIR nanoprobes based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) hold great prospects in sensitive and deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS/RNS, and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In this review, we systematically summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances of UCNPs&#8208;based NIR probes for ROS/RNS sensing, and the potential challenges and perspectives for further research are also highlighted. We envision that such a research field will have a bright future for modern biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Approach for Expanding the Three&#8208;Dimensional Space of Tetrahydroquinoline to Develop BET Bromodomain Inhibitors**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF  3  .OEt  2  , which generates a highly electrophilic aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one&#8208;pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a  cis  &#8208;2,3 and  trans  &#8208;3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three&#8208;step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2&#8208;selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti&#8208;inflammatory effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical S  E  Ar mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H / E (E = electrophile) substitution under formal H  +  elimination. Herein, we report a new variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)  3  , is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C  6  F  5  )  3  ) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyano&#173;methane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)  2  , which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the S  E  Ar mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.</dc:description>

         <title>Templated generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor by isomer&#8208;free SPAAC based on azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8208;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8208;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37 &#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2.800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in the aqueous environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes via Intramolecular Chlorine Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of enynes has contributed significantly to the construction of chiral cyclic molecules. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric cyclization involving halopalladation remains an unresolved challenge with the inevitable disturbance of the halide ions. Herein, an intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy is used to accomplish the enantioselective chloropalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This reaction provides a redox&#8208;neutral approach to a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The precisely controlled coordination of palladium with both the in&#8208;situ generated nucleophilic species and the monodentate phosphoramidite ligand is crucial for enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Simple synthetic modifications that tune the molecular structures, thereby the properties of the molecules, are of topical interest. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel cationic rosaniline&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (Acetic acid and BF3&#8226;Et2O). The condensation reaction of rosaniline with 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol in acetic acid renders &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP (CMP&#8208;A) while changing the acid to BF3&#8226;Et2O, the linkages transform to enol and undergoes BF2&#8208;complexation, leading to boronil CMP (CMP&#8208;B). BF2&#8208;functionalities in boranil CMP significantly modified the optical and functional properties compared to &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP. The cationic&#8208;delocalization along with the extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization supported by chromophoric BF2&#8208;groups allow CMP&#8208;B to exhibit broad absorption spanning the visible to Near&#8208;Infrared region (NIR). The absorption red&#8208;edge of CMP&#8208;B appears around 1277 nm (optical band gap ~1.58 eV) while CMP&#8208;A displays at 981 nm (optical band gap ~1.83 eV). Most interestingly, as a photocatalyst, CMP&#8208;B catalyzes hydrogen evolution with a superior rate of 252 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 over CMP&#8208;A (100 &#181;mol g&#8208;1). It is about 2.5 times higher performance. The transient photocurrent measurements, electrochemical impedance data, and in&#8208;depth mott&#8208;Schottky analysis demonstrate that the BF2&#8208;group in CMP&#8208;B generates photoinduced charge carriers and their migration towards the active sites for photocatalysis. These polymers show significant photocatalytic H2 generation without any supportive metal co&#8208;catalyst. The BF2 complexed building blocks are a unique class of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution through green and cost&#8208;effective approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Determining Electronic Structure of ZnO Quantum Dots with Different Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure of quantum dots (QDs) including band edges and possible trap states is an important physical property for optoelectronic applications. The reliable determination of the energy levels of QDs remains a big challenge. Herein we employ cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the energy levels of three types of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. Coupled with spectroscopic techniques, it is found that the onset potential of the first reductive wave is likely related to the conduction band edges while the first oxidative wave originates from the trap states. The determined specific energy levels in CV further demonstrates that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies. The present electrochemical method offers a powerful and effective way to determine the energy levels of wide bandgap ZnO QDs, which will boost their device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of [FeII(Atrz)3]SO4 and its Analogues Through Accelerated Ageing: New Insights from Small&#8208;Scale Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accelerated ageing reactions that take place between two solid materials on contact in the absence of added solvent have been used to synthesise two spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active 1D coordination polymers and one of their Cu(II) analogues. The hygroscopy of the ligands and the relative humidity of the reaction chamber have been shown to be a particularly important factor in the rate of reaction. Small&#8208;scale reactions between a few individual crystals have allowed observation of deliquescence of the 4&#8208;aminotriazole ligand at high humidity. The metal salt does not dissolve, and the ligand diffuses into the crystal of the metal salt during the reaction. In the case of the Cu analogue, the formation of the product causes the crystal of the metal salt to deform with the formation of pseudocrystals, which have a fibrous structure.</dc:description>

         <title>New Synthetic Route to Water&#8208;Soluble Prism[5]arene Hosts and Their Molecular Recognition Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prismarene hosts can be prepared by a direct macrocyclization of functionalized naphthalene monomers. Water soluble prismarene hosts H1 and H3 bind to hydrophobic dications in phosphate buffered saline with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for G9. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.







Abstract
We report that the direct macrocyclization of naphthalene monomers bearing ethyl ester functional groups delivers prism[5]arene derivatives, which can be deprotected to yield water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arenes (H1 and H3). 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy showed that dicationic guests bind with the hydrophobic cores buried inside the anisotropic magnetically shielding cavity. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements showed that H1 and H3 are high&#8208;affinity hosts in PBS&#8208;buffered water with Ka values exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for a select guest. The complexation events are driven by the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and electrostatic interactions. Host H1 displays somewhat higher affinity toward a common guest than pillar[6]arene bearing carboxylic acid functional groups but is significantly less potent than pillar[6]arene bearing sulfate groups. H1 and H3 should be considered alongside other high affinity hosts for a variety of chemical and biological applications.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Amines and a Four&#8208;Armed Cyano&#8208;Substituted Luminophore through Hydrogen Bonds for Potential Development of Smart Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;armed cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene luminophore was synthesized, which can spontaneously co&#8208;assemble with chiral amines through intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds, resulting in characteristic chiroptical properties at both ground state and excited state.







Abstract
Chirality transfer from chiral molecules to assemblies is of vital importance to the design of functional chiral materials. In this work, selective co&#8208;assembly behaviors between chiral molecules and an achiral luminophore, potentially driven by the intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds are reported. Cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene carboxylic acid (TA) served as the luminophore and hydrogen bond donors, which underwent co&#8208;assembly with different chiral amines. It was found that structures of chiral amines affect the chirality transfer and the properties of co&#8208;assemblies due to effects on hydrogen bonds and stacking pattern. Only in specific co&#8208;assemblies, the chiroptical properties occurred at both ground state and excited states based on the emerged Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals, revealing that the chirality was successfully transferred from molecular level to supramolecular level. In addition, accurate quantitative examination of chiral amines was realized by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This work demonstrates the characteristic chirality response and transfer through co&#8208;assembly, providing a potential method to develop smart chiroptical materials.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Labeled Riboswitch Synthesized from a Protected TPA Phosphoramidite Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) has been protected with a light sensitive 2&#8208;NBOM group and connected to a uridine phosphoramidite building block. Spin&#8208;labeled RNA can be obtained from this compound by standard protocols of oligonucleotide synthesis and used for EPR studies after light&#8208;induced deprotection.







Abstract
The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) is an excellent spin label for EPR studies of RNA. Previous synthetic methods, however, are complicated and require special equipment. Herein, we describe a uridine derived phosphoramidite with a photocaged TPA unit attached. The light sensitive 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxymethyl group can be removed in high yield by short irradiation at 365&#8197;nm. Based on this approach, a doubly spin&#8208;labeled 27mer neomycin sensing riboswitch was synthesized and studied by PELDOR. The overall thermal stability of the fold is not much reduced by TPA. In&#8208;line probing nevertheless detected changes in local mobility.

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Cyclic Ketones with Dehydroalanine via H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directing Enamine Catalysis: Straightforward Access to Enantiopure Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct, highly enantioselective organocatalytic alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine via a conjugate addition reaction is reported. The use of a chiral bifunctional primary amine/thiourea catalyst was key to obtain the enantiopure, functionalized (substituted ketone) unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids in good yields and remarkable selectivity. The mechanism of the reactions was explored by mass spectrometry studies.







Abstract
The growing importance of structurally diverse and functionalized enantiomerically pure unnatural amino acids in the design of drugs, including peptides, has stimulated the development of new synthetic methods. This study reports the challenging direct asymmetric alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine derivatives via a conjugate addition reaction for the synthesis of enantiopure ketone&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids. The key to success was the design of a bifunctional primary amine&#8208;thiourea catalyst that combines H&#8208;bond&#8208;directing activation and enamine catalysis. The simultaneous dual activation of the two relatively unreactive partners, confirmed by mass spectrometry studies, results in high reactivity while securing high levels of stereocontrol. A broad substrate scope is accompanied by versatile downstream chemical modifications. The mild reaction conditions and consistently excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;95&#8201;%&#8197;ee in most cases) render this protocol highly practical for the rapid construction of valuable noncanonical enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid building blocks.

         <title>Triple Regioselective Functionalization of Cationic [4]Helicenes via Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation and Suzuki Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In essentially one&#8208;pot, using Ir&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis, tris(arene)&#8208;functionalized cationic [4]helicenes are synthesized with full regioselectivity and enantiospecificity starting from a trivial precursor (17 examples). This poly&#8208;addition of aryl groups improves key optical properties, that is, fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes. Electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signatures are observed up to the far&#8208;red domain, in particular with additional arenes prone to aggregation.

         <title>Terminal N2 Dissociation in [(PNN)Fe(N2)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2) Leads to Local Spin&#8208;State Changes and Augmented Bridging N2 Activation</title>

Small stimulus, big change. Vacuum&#8208;induced reversible dissociation of terminal N2&#8208;units lead to structural and electronic reorganisation resulting in a significant activation of a bridging N2 ligand.







Abstract
Nitrogen fixation at iron centres is a fundamental catalytic step for N2 utilisation, relevant to biological (nitrogenase) and industrial (Haber&#8208;Bosch) processes. This step is coupled with important electronic structure changes which are currently poorly understood. We show here for the first time that terminal dinitrogen dissociation from iron complexes that coordinate N2 in a terminal and bridging fashion leaves the Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe unit intact but significantly enhances the degree of N2 activation (&#916;&#957;&#8776;180&#8197;cm&#8722;1, Raman spectroscopy) through charge redistribution. The transformation proceeds with local spin state change at the iron centre (S=
&#8594;S=3/2). Further dissociation of the bridging N2 can be induced under thermolytic conditions, triggering a disproportionation reaction, from which the tetrahedral (PNN)2Fe could be isolated. This work shows that dinitrogen activation can be induced in the absence of external chemical stimuli such as reducing agents or Lewis acids.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt chalcogenides CoX2  (X=S, Se, Te) render great performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries based on catalytic capacity to alleviate shuttle effect. Given that S/Se/Te belong to the same main group, the outstanding cycling stability delivered by CoTe2  aroused the curiosity about the uniqueness of CoTe2  and intrinsic laws of cobalt chalcogenide. Herein, comprehensive theoretical study delivers new insights into the intrinsic laws of CoX2  : the relative vertical distance of two X atomic layers (rather than atom electronegativity) mainly controls adsorption; CoX2  mainly regulates the charging process (rather than discharging process) thus contributes to great cycling stability. On this basis, the advantages of CoTe2  are three&#8208;fold: moderate polysulfide adsorption, facile ion transport capacity, and surprisingly great promotion of charging process. It is hope the results will facilitate the development of cobalt chalcogenides, especially tellurides as cataytic material in lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Coordinated Transition Metal Ion on Magnetic Relaxation of Lanthanide Based Complexes with Imino Nitroxide Biradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In spite of achievement of a lot of Ln&#8208;radical SMMs, how to improve magnetic behavior&#160;of Ln&#8208;radical system&#160;remains challenging. Here, two series of Ln&#8208;radical complexes have successfully been built using an imino nitroxide biradical, namely, [Ln  2  (hfac)  6  (ImPhPyobis)  2  ] (Ln  III  = Gd  1  , Tb  2  , Dy  &#160;  3  ) and [Ln  2  Cu  2  (hfac)  10  (ImPhPyobis)  2  ] (Ln  III  = Gd  4  , Dy  &#160;  5  ; hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate and ImPhPyobis = 5&#8208;(4&#8208;oxypyridinium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3&#8208; bis(1'&#8208;oxyl&#8208;4',4',5',5'&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene). For these biradical&#8208;metal complexes, two imino nitroxide biradicals bind two Ln(III) ions via their oxygen atoms coming from 4&#8208;oxypyridinium units to produce a binuclear {Ln  2  O  2  } unit. Those imino nitroxide groups are free for complexes  1  &#8208;  3  , however one of imino nitroxide groups of the biradical is ligated to the copper(II) ion for complexes  4  and  5  . The distinct magnetic relaxation behaviors are observed for two Dy derivatives, as revealed by ac magnetic studies: complex  3  presents one magnetic process with the effective energy barrier(  U  eff  ) of 74.0K while complex  5  exhibits dual relaxation processes with  U  eff  values for the fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;relaxation being 20.2K and 30.9K, respectively, which implies that the second coordination sphere of Dy ion plays a critical role for magnetic relaxation.</dc:description>

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes Under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reacting the t Bu PNNP expanded pincer ligand with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh 3 ) 3 (CO) at 140 &#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO) 2 ] ( 1 ) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KO t Bu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru 2 ( t Bu PNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;O t Bu)(CO) 2 ] ( 3 ) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core. This enables metal&#8208;ligand cooperative activation of H 2 analogous to the mononuclear analogue, [Ru( t Bu PNP*)H(CO)]. In contrast to the mononuclear system, the bimetallic analogue 3 allows for the E &#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes at ambient temperature and atmospheric H 2 pressure with good functional group tolerance. Monitoring the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene by 1 H NMR spectroscopy shows the intermediacy of Z &#8208;stilbene, which is subsequently isomerized to the E &#8208;isomer. Initial findings into the mode of action of this system are provided, including the spectroscopic characterization of a polyhydride intermediate and the isolation of a deactivated species with a partially hydrogenated naphthyridine backbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential formation of heteroternary CB[10] complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The globular and monocationic guest molecule trimethyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane (  AZAP  , a protonated Verkade superbase) was shown to form a host:guest 1:1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water. Molecular dynamics calculations showed that CB[10] adopts an 8&#8208;shape with  AZAP  occupying the majority of the internal space, CB[10] contracting around  AZAP  and leaving a significant part of the cavity unoccupied. This residual space was used to co&#8208;include planar and monocationic coguest (  CG  ) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8226;  AZAP  &#8226;  CG  complexes potentially opening new perspectives in supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;based Aerogels catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide, the most widely distributed carbon source in nature, has been widely investigated for its reduction and reuse. In this field, nanometallic materials have been widely studied because of their excellent photo/electrocatalytic activity. As one of the nanometallic materials, metal aerogel has the unique advantages of high electron transfer rate and large specific surface area, as well as rich pore space and strong adsorption performance, which makes it a highly researched material for catalytic CO  2  reduction in recent years. In this paper, we firstly report the latest preparation methods of metal aerogels and the recent progress in electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction. After that, the properties of several typical metallic aerogels and their latest applications in electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction are described. Finally, the vision and research directions for the future industrialization of metal aerogels for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction are proposed from the perspective of practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Conductive/Insulating Bi&#8208;functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients&#160;and high safety. However, the dendrite growth and side reactions occur in Zn anode, which lead to the exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and the poor cycling&#8208;stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anode.  The porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as conductive layer effectively reduces nuclear barrier and contains Zn  2+  deposition in a certain space.  Polyimide  (PI) coatings using as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn  2+  , which could reduce the differential&#8208;concentration on the Zn surface and induce the uniform deposition of Zn  2+  . Therefore, the CIBL&#8208;Zn//CIBL&#8208;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300 hours at 1  mA cm  &#8208;2  . The CE of CIBL&#8208;Zn//CIBL&#8208;Zn battery maintains at 99.2% even after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the CIBL&#8208;Zn//V  2  O  5  battery exhibits a capacity of nearly 289.2 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  after 3000 cycles and no sign of capacity degradation is found, which further demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in practical application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of hexachlorophosphazene, P3N3Cl6, with SO3 and the gold halides AuCl3 and AuBr3, respectively, leads to the new cyclic anionic tetramer, [S4N2O10]2&#8722;, which is coordinated to Au3+ in the dimeric complexes [Au2X2(S4N2O10)2] (X = Cl, Br). The [S4N2O10]2&#8722; anion can be seen as the condensation product of two sulfate anions, [SO4]2&#8722;, and two amidosulfate anions, [NH2SO3]&#8722;.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insights into the very low activity of the homocoenzyme B12 adenosylmethylcobalamin in coenzyme B12&#8208;dependent diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The X&#8208;ray structures of coenzyme B  12  (AdoCbl)&#8208;dependent eliminating isomerases complexed with adenosylmethylcobalamin (AdoMeCbl) were determined. As judged from geometries, its Co&#8208;C bond in diol dehydratase (DD) is not activated even in the presence of substrate. In ethanolamine ammonia&#8208;lyase (EAL), the bond is elongated in the absence of substrate, and in the presence of substrate, the complex likely exists in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;homolysis states. The impacts of incorporation of an extra CH  2  group are different in the two enzymes: The DD active site is flexible and AdoMeCbl binding causes large conformational changes that make DD unable to adopt the catalytic state, whereas the EAL active site is rigid and AdoMeCbl binding does not induce significant conformational changes. Such flexibility and rigidity of the active sites may reflect the tightness of adenine binding. The structures provide good insights into the basis of the very low activity of AdoMeCbl in these enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiluminescent Imaging Assay of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Protein with Target&#8208;Induced Enzyme Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simple but robust testing assays are essential for screening and diagnosis of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) in COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here,  we described  a  chemiluminescent imaging assay  (  CLIA  ) for  sensitive and convenient  detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) by a target&#8208;induced enzyme activity regulation (T&#8208;EAR) strategy.  The T&#8208;EAR used a pair of antibody&#8208;DNA probes to recognize SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP and proximity&#8208;induced rolling circle amplification for mass&#8208;production of pyrophosphate to coordinate with Cu  2+  , which prevented the reduction of Cu  2+  to Cu  +  by sodium ascorbate as well as the Cu  +  &#8208;caused inactivation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP).  The activity retention of HRP produced strong CL signal for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 NP by catalyzing the oxidation of luminol by H  2  O  2  . The  T&#8208;EAR based  CLIA  showed a wide detection range from 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL&#160;  (13 fM to 1.3 nM)  with the requirement of only 0.75 &#956;L of sample.  This CLIA had advantages of good sensitivity, simple  wash&#8208;free  operation, acceptable accuracy, and  high&#8208;throughput imaging detection  , displaying potential applicability in  screening assay of COVID&#8208;19 infection  .</dc:description>

         <title>Dual MOF&#8208;derived MoS2/CdS Photocatalysts with Rich Sulfur Vacancies for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coctalyst&#160;plays an important role in efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis. Herein,a MoS  2  /CdS photocatalyst with MoS  2  as cocatalyst was designed by using Mo&#8208;MOF and Cd&#8208;MOF as precursors. Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase,&#160;MoS  2  shows strong charge capture and transport ability.&#160;The photo&#8208;generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bounded by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS  2  through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large&#8208;scale MoS  2  .The optimal photocatalyst 1%MoS  2  /CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity,&#160;which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt.&#160;This work highlights the role of Mo&#8208;MOF derived MoS  2  with 1T&#8208;2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS  2  /CdS composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar Driven Gas Phase Advanced Oxidation Processes for Methane Removal &#8211; Challenges and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane (CH  4  ) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH  4  emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5  o  C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH  4  emissions by developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH  4  (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH  4  removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale.</dc:description>
