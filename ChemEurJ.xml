         <title>Solvent Acts as the Referee in a Match&#8208;up Between Charged and Preorganized Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevalence of cation&#8208;anion contacts in biomolecular recognition under aqueous conditions suggests that ionic interactions should dominate the binding of anions in solvents across both high and low polarities. Investigations of this idea using titrations in low polarity solvents are impaired by interferences from ion pairing that prevent a clear picture of binding. To address this limitation and test the impact of ion&#8208;ion interactions across multiple solvents, we quantified chloride binding to a cationic receptor after accounting for ion pairing. In these studies, we created a chelate receptor using aryl&#8208;triazole CH donors and a quinolinium that directs its cationic methyl inside the binding pocket. In low&#8208;polarity dichloromethane, the 1:1 complex (log&#160;K1:1&#160;~ 7.3) is more stable than neutral chelates, but fortuitously comparable to a preorganized macrocycle (log&#160;K1:1 ~ 6.9). Polar acetonitrile and DMSO diminish stabilities of the charged receptor (log&#160;K1:1&#160;~3.7 and 1.9) but surprisingly 100&#8208;fold more than the macrocycle. While both receptors lose stability by dielectric screening of electrostatic stability, the cationic receptor also pays additional costs of organization. Even though the charged and disorganized receptor has stronger binding in apolar solvents, the organized but uncharged receptor has more anion affinity in polar solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates via Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A scalable straightforward synthesis of monofluoro&#8208; and difluoro&#173;methyl &#173;triflate CF3SO2OCH2F (MH2F) and CF3SO2OCHF2&#160;(MHF2) via electrochemical fluorination (Simons process, ECF) of methyl triflate&#160;MH3&#160;in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at nickel anodes is pre&#173;sent&#173;ed. The ECF method is also feasible for the preparation of the deuterated analogues CF3SO2OCD2F (MD2F) and CF3SO2OCDF2&#160;(MD2F). Surprisingly, no H/D exchange occurs during ECF of CF3SO2OCD3&#160;(MD3), which provides further evidence for a NiF3/NiF4&#8208;mediated ECF mechanism. The ECF of selected partially fluorinated ethyl triflates is described and electro&#173;chemical fluorination of CF3SO2&#173;O&#173;CH2CF3&#160;(EH2F3) leads to the so far unknown chiral CF3SO2&#173;OCHFCF3&#160;(EHFF3). The analogous fluoromethyl and fluoroethyl nonaflates are also accessible via ECF. The present study contains detailed spec&#173;tros&#173;copic, structural, and thermal data on (fluoro)methyl and fluoro(ethyl) triflates.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the crystallisation and hydration state of crystalline porous organic salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOS) are a subclass of molecular crystals. The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale&#8208;up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS&#8208;7, formed from tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS&#8208;7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS&#8208;7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS&#8208;7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS&#8208;7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS&#8208;7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3 mmol/g at 195 K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of ABCD&#8208;Porphyrin Platinum(II) Complexes via Dehydrative Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes synthesis of ABCD&#8208;porphryin Pt(II) complexes via dehydrative aromatization in one&#8208;pot from corresponding dipyrrinatoPt(II) complexes and bisformyldipyrrins. This procedure also enables the construction of a C1&#8208;symmetrical ABCD&#8208;porphyrin with intrinsic chirality from achiral precursors. The photophysical properties of obtained molecules are also described in detail.







Abstract
Since the development of the first method for porphyrin synthesis by Rothemund in 1935, porphyrin derivatives have been widely investigated and have played an essential role in chemical sciences. Most synthetic routes of porphyrins involve oxidative aromatization. Herein, we present a synthetic method to produce ABCD&#8208;porphyrins, including chiral ones, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving &#8220;coordination, cyclization, and dehydrative aromatization&#8221; using a mono&#8208;dipyrrinatoPt(II)Cl(COE) (COE=cyclooctene) complex as a platinum template.

         <title>Mn(II) Polypyridyl Complexes: Precursors to High Valent Mn(V)=O Species and Inhibitors of Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>

High valent MnV=O at room temperature: This works highlights the identification and characterization of a transient MnV=O species with the help of an in&#8197;situ generated anionic moiety. The oxidative species are mapped to trigger intracellular redox modulation to prevent cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
The reaction of [(L)MnII]2+ (L = neutral polypyridine ligand framework) in the presence of mCPBA (mCPBA = m&#8208;Chloroperoxybenzoic acid) generates a putative MnV=O species at RT. The proposed MnV=O species is capable of performing the aromatic hydroxylation of Cl&#8208;benzoic acid derived from mCPBA to give [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, which in the presence of excess mCPBA generates a metastable [(L)MnV(O)(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, characterized by UV/Vis absorption, EPR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ESI&#8208;MS studies. The current study highlights the fact that [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ formation may not be a dead end for catalysis. Further, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ from [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+. The characterized transient [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of para&#8208;substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non&#8208;heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.

The characterized transient [(L)Mn&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;(O)-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-Cl-salicylate)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non-heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2H&#8208;Phosphindole&#8208;Enabled Dearomatization and [4+2] Cycloaddition of (Hetero)Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their unique electronic properties, the low&#8208;coordinate heavier main&#8208;group element species display high reactivity toward inert small molecules. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as reactive phosphadiene undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, providing simple but straightforward access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with bridgehead phosphorus.







Abstract
The heavier main group multiple bonds offer an effective tool for small molecule activation. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as a reactive phosphadiene system undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, including naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, and benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, affording concise access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with phosphorus at the bridgehead. These results demonstrate that non&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes are capable of acting as 2&#960; systems in [4+2] cycloaddition with highly reactive 2H&#8208;phosphindole complex.

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction: Pd/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Borocarbonylation of Aryldiazonium Salts with Aliphatic Terminal Alkynes to gem&#8208;Bis(boryl) Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient multicomponent procedure for the borocarbonylative synthesis of gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones has been developed. With aliphatic terminal alkynes, CO, aryldiazonium salts, and B2pin2 as the substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones were isolated in moderate to good yields by using ethyl acetate as a proton source.







Abstract
We report the development of Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed selective 2,1&#8208;borocarbonylation reactions of aliphatic terminal alkynes with aryldiazonium salts and B2Pin2 to prepare gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones in one&#8208;pot. A series of corresponding products are obtained with good to excellent yields under a carbon monoxide atmosphere (10&#8197;bar). In addition, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance can be observed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that ethyl acetate serves as a proton source in the reaction.

         <title>Investigations of the Photothermal Properties of a Series of Molecular Gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) Complexes Absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermal properties of a series of hydrophobic gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III region were evaluated in organic solvents and in aqueous solution after encapsulation in polymer nanoparticles.







Abstract
The photothermal properties of a series of neutral radical gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes absorbing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;III window (1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm) have been investigated. This class of complexes was found to be good photothermal agents (PTAs) in toluene under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation with photothermal efficiencies around 40 and 60&#8201;% depending on the nature of the dithiolene ligand. To the best of our knowledge, these complexes are the first small molecular photothermal agents to absorb so far into the near infrared. To test their applicability in water, these hydrophobic complexes have been encapsulated into nanoparticles constituted by amphiphilic block&#8208;copolymers. Stable suspensions of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes have been prepared which show a diameter around 100&#8197;nm. The encapsulation rate was found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the dithiolene ligands. The photothermal properties of the aqueous suspensions containing gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes were then studied under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation. These studies demonstrate that water has strong photothermal activity in the NIR&#8208;III region that, cannot be overcome even with the addition of gold complexes displaying good photothermal properties.

         <dc:description>
Meet to defeat: A strategic round&#8208;table meeting has been convened between inorganic chemistry and pharmacology to tackle malaria, one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. As a result, metals have been deliberately conjugated with the antimalarial quinoline Amodiaquine. These metal&#8211;amodiaquine complexes have overcome the limitations of metal&#8208;free quinolines, and light has been shed on their potential as a chemical tool for designing new drugs against malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Colina&#8208;Vegas, D.&#8197;R.&#8197;M. Moreira and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301642).

         <title>Closed Synthetic Cycle for Nickel&#8208;Based Dihydrogen Formation</title>

         <dc:description>Dihydrogen evolution was observed in a two&#8208;step protonation reaction starting from a Ni(0) precursor with a tripodal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. &#160;Upon the first protonation, a Ni(II) monohydride complex is formed, isolated, and fully characterized. &#160;Subsequent protonation yields H2via a transient intermediate (INT) and an isolable Ni(II) acetonitrile complex. &#160;The latter can be reduced to regenerate its Ni(0) precursor. &#160;The mechanism of H2 formation was investigated by using a deute&#173;rated acid and scrutinized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. &#160;Remarkably, the second protona&#173;tion forms a rare nickel dihydrogen complex, detected and identified in solution, and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. DFT&#8208;based computational analyses were employed to propose a reaction profile and a molecular structure of a Ni&#8210;H2 complex. &#160;Thus, a dihydrogen&#8208;evolving, closed&#8208;synthetic cycle is reported with a rare Ni&#8211;H2 species as a key intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoisomerization of &#8220;Partially Embedded Dihydropyridazine&#8221; with a Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of two &#8220;partiallyembedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDH) and the demonstration of their intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical structure. Introducing bulky electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups into the aza[5]helicene framework (PDH&#8208;CF3 and &#8208;C2F5) gives PDH axial chirality based on the helicity of the P and M forms, even at room temperature. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation of PDH&#8208;CF3 in a frozen solution, an ESR signal from the triplet biradical with zero&#8208;field splitting values, generated by N&#8211;N bond dissociation, was observed. However, when the irradiation was turned off, the ESR signal became silent, indicating the existence of two equilibriums, between the biradical and quinoidal forms based on the Kekul&#233; structure, and between N&#8211;N bond cleavage and recombination. The observed photo&#8208; and thermally induced behaviors indicate that T&#8208;type photochromic molecules are involved in the photoisomerization mechanism involving the two equilibriums. Inspired by the photoisomerization, chirality control of PDH by photoracemization was achieved. Multiple functionalities, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to the &#8220;partiallyembedded dihydropyridazine&#8221; structure, are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>A Freestanding 3D Skeleton with Gradationally Distributed Lithiophilic Sites for Realizing Stable Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li metal anodes are drawing considerable attention owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacities and low electrochemical reduction potentials. However, their commercialization has been hampered by safety hazards induced by continuous dendrite growth. These issues can be alleviated using the ZnO&#8208;modified 3D carbon&#8208;based host containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon felt (CF) fabricated by electroplating in the present study (denoted as ZnO/CNT@CF); the constructed skeleton has lithiophilic ZnO that is gradationally distributed along its thickness. The utilization of an inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8208;Li anode obtained by flipping over the carbon skeleton after Li electrodeposition is also reported herein. The synergistic effect of the Li metal and lithiophilic sites reduces the nucleation overpotential, thus inducing Li+ to preferentially deposit inside the porous carbon&#8208;based scaffold. The composite electrode compels Li to grow away from the separator, thereby significantly improving battery safety. A symmetric cell with the inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8208;Li electrode operates steadily for 700 cycles at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8208;Li|S cell exhibits an initial areal capacity of 10.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a S loading of 10.4 mg cm&#8722;2 and maintains a capacity of 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 320 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of In&#8208;Droplet Multicellular Communities by Light&#8208;Induced Combinatorial DNA Barcoding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for labeling cells with microdroplet identifiers generated from a set of DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads is demonstrated. By employing a combinatorial approach, in which combinations of DNA barcodes from randomly encapsulated multiple DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads collectively serve as unique molecular identifiers, generating many unique identifiers becomes feasible. In microdroplets, DNA barcoding molecules released from microbeads tag cell membranes, which are then read by single&#8208;cell sequencing.







Abstract
A microdroplet co&#8208;culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8211;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single&#8208;cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Herein, we present a strategy for generating in&#8208;droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA&#8208;functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serve as a second information carrier readable by single&#8208;cell sequencing to reconstitute the community in silico in the single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing data space.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Reduction of Disulfides in an Undivided Cell under Mass Transfer Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroorganic synthesis is generally considered to be a green alternative to conventional redox reactions. Electrochemical reductions, however, are less advantageous in terms of sustainability, as sacrificial metal anodes are often employed. Divided cell operation avoids contact of the reduction products with the anode and allows for convenient solvent oxidation, enabling metal free greener electrochemical reductions. However, the ion exchange membranes required for divided cell operation on a commercial scale are not amenable to organic solvents, which hinders their applicability. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of oxidatively sensitive compounds can be carried out in an undivided cell without sacrificial metal anodes by controlling the mass transport to a small surface area electrode. The concept is showcased by an electrochemical method for the reductive cleavage of aryl disulfides. Fine tuning of the electrode surface area and current density has enabled the preparation of a wide variety of thiols without formation of any oxidation side products. This strategy is anticipated to encourage further research on greener, metal free electrochemical reductions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chlorination of CS2 leads to trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, Cl3CSCl, in moderate yields. The oxidation of Cl3CSCl with H2O2 gives Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of trichloromethanesulfonic acid.

         <title>Construction of [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure to change charge density and regulate spontaneous polarization to achieve efficient pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric water splitting system of NaNbO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting still face the problems of difficult low spontaneous polarization intensity and excessive carrier recombination. Based on the above problems, we altered the interaction between S&#8208;Nb&#8208;S in the [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure achieved the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. The results show that under the stimulation of light and temperature fluctuations, the current density of the NS&#8208;4 photoanode is as high as 0.574 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is about 1.59 times higher than the pure NaNbO3 current density value, and the NS &#8208;4 photoanode achieves IPCE value of 16.08%. The first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal the principle of the [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure for the suppression function of the carrier recombination and the improvement function of the pyroelectric effect. The analysis shows that the S&#8208;doping leads to the weakening of S&#8208;Nb&#8208;S interactions in the [NbO]6&#8208;x&#8208;xS structure, which improves the pyroelectric effect and suppresses the photo/pyro&#8208;generated carrier recombination, and effectively enhances the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system. This work promotes the development of pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.</dc:description>

Based on the above problems, we altered the interaction between S-Nb-S in the [NbO]6-x-xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6-x-xS structure achieved the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. The results show that under the stimulation of light and temperature fluctuations, the current density of the NS-4 photoanode is as high as 0.574 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is about 1.59 times higher than the pure NaNbO3 current density value, and the NS -4 photoanode achieves IPCE value of 16.08%. The first-principles density-functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal the principle of the [NbO]6-x-xS structure for the suppression function of the carrier recombination and the improvement function of the pyroelectric effect. The analysis shows that the S-doping leads to the weakening of S-Nb-S interactions in the [NbO]6-x-xS structure, which improves the pyroelectric effect and suppresses the photo/pyro-generated carrier recombination, and effectively enhances the performance of the pyro-photo-electric synergistic water splitting system. This work promotes the development of pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature Directs the Majority&#8208;Rules Principle in Supramolecular Copolymers Driven by Triazine&#8211;Benzene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular copolymerization of chiral comonomers into helical assemblies can introduce competing polymerization pathways. Temperature can be used to control the composition of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based copolymers and thereby invert the helical screw&#8208;sense of the assemblies. By combining spectroscopy with computations, the authors show that the temperature&#8208;dependent helical structure originates from the copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have typically been studied in the extreme cases, such as self&#8208;sorting or highly mixed copolymer systems, while the intermediate systems have been less understood. We have reported the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure in copolymers of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives based on charge&#8208;transfer interactions with a highly alternating microstructure at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the temperature&#8208;dependent copolymerization further and increase the complexity by combining triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives with opposite preferred helicities. In this case, intercalation of the benzene&#8208;derivative into the triazine&#8208;derivative assemblies causes a helical inversion. The inversion of the net helicity was rationalized by comparing the mismatch penalties of the individual monomers, which indicated that the benzene&#8208;derivative dictates the helical screw&#8208;sense of the supramolecular copolymers. Surprisingly, this was not reflected in further investigations of slightly modified triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives, thus highlighting that the outcome is a subtle balance between structural features, where small differences can be amplified due to the competitive nature of the interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based supramolecular copolymers determines the copolymer helicity of the presented system in a similar way as the mixed majority&#8208;rules phenomenon.

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and displaying 6 or 12&#8197;monofluorocyclooctyne units grafted onto their surface allowed the design of deoxynojirimycin clusters by copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry ligation. The dendrimers proved to be potent &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors and behave as pharmacological chaperones in Gaucher disease cells. These dendrimers functionalized by monofluorocyclooctynes units may find numerous applications to prepare multivalent objects for biological purposes.







Abstract
The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8208;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, the final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100&#8197;nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.

         <title>Sequential Water Sorption/Desorption of a Nonporous Adaptive Organic Ligand Bridged Coordination Polymer for Atmospheric Moisture Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonporous anionic coordination polymer of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen as charge balancing ions that displays sequential water sorption/desorption has shown its potential in application for atmospheric water harvesting.







Abstract
Moisture harvesters with favourable attributes such as easy synthetic availability and good processability as alternatives for atmospheric moisture harvesting (AWH) are desirable. This study reports a novel nonporous anionic coordination polymer (CP) of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen (MV2+) as charge balancing ions (named U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP) which displays intriguing sequential water sorption/desorption behavior as the relative humidity (RH) changes gradually. The evaluation of AWH performance of U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP shows that it can absorb water vapor under air atmosphere at a low RH of 20&#8201;% typical of the levels found in most dry regions of the world, and have good cycling durability, thus demonstrating the capability as a potential moisture harvester for AWH. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first report on non&#8208;porous organic ligand bridged CP materials for AWH. Moreover, a stepwise water&#8208;filling mechanism for the water sorption/desorption process is deciphered by comprehensive characterizations combining single&#8208;crystal diffraction, which provides a reasonable explanation for the special moisture harvesting behaviour of this non&#8208;porous crystalline material.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Crabtree&#8208;Pfaltz Hydrogenation of Olefins &#8208; An Interplay of Experimentation and Quantum Chemical Computation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic hydrogenation of unfunctionalized, highly substituted olefins once was a difficult task that was solved by Crabtree with his iridium catalyst that was further improved by Pfaltz and others. Mechanistic aspects of this type of reactions have been elucidated by an interplay of experiment and quantum chemical calculations; nevertheless, open questions exist, which require further effort particularly by theoretical chemists.







Abstract
Introduction of Crabtree's iridium&#8208;based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hydrogenation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&#8722; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to numerous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic details posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et&#8197;al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed IrI/IrIII catalytic cycle by a novel IrIII/IrV cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to describe a fascinating interplay of experiments and quantum chemical calculations for an important synthetic method.

     alt="Mechanistic Aspects of the Crabtree-Pfaltz Hydrogenation of Olefins - An Interplay of Experimentation and Quantum Chemical Computation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic hydrogenation of unfunctionalized, highly substituted olefins once was a difficult task that was solved by Crabtree with his iridium catalyst that was further improved by Pfaltz and others. Mechanistic aspects of this type of reactions have been elucidated by an interplay of experiment and quantum chemical calculations; nevertheless, open questions exist, which require further effort particularly by theoretical chemists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction of Crabtree's iridium-based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hydrogenation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to numerous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic details posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et&#8197;al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed Ir&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle by a novel Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/Ir&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to describe a fascinating interplay of experiments and quantum chemical calculations for an important synthetic method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;Porphyrin with Redox&#8208;Responsive 1H and 19F Relaxation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported that is capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and a 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.







Abstract
A new fluorinated manganese porphyrin, (Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3) is reported capable of providing, based on the Mn(III)/Mn(II) equilibrium, dual 1H relaxivity and 19F&#8197;NMR response to redox changes. The physical&#8208;chemical characterization of both redox states in DMSO&#8208;d6/H2O evidenced that the 1H relaxometric and 19F&#8197;NMR properties are appropriate for differential redox MRI detection. The Mn(III)&#8208;F distance (dMn&#8722;F=9.7&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;), as assessed by DFT calculations, is well tailored to allow for adequate paramagnetic effect of Mn(III) on 19F T1 and T2 relaxation times. Mn&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 has a reversible Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox potential of 0.574&#8197;V vs. NHE in deoxygenated aqueous HEPES/ THF solution. The reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 in the presence of ascorbic acid is slowly, but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen, as monitored by UV&#8208;Vis spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR. The broad 1H and 19F&#8197;NMR signals of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 disappear in the presence of 1&#8197;equivalent ascorbate replaced by a shifted and broadened 19F&#8197;NMR signal from Mn(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3. Phantom 19F MR images in DMSO show a MRI signal intensity decrease upon reduction of Mn(III)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3, retrieved upon complete reoxidation in air within ~24&#8197;h. 1H&#8197;NMRD curves of the Mn(III)/(II)&#8208;TPP&#8208;p&#8208;CF3 chelates in mixed DMSO/water solvent have the typical shape of Mn(II)/Mn(III) porphyrins.

         <dc:description>
In the realm of chemical synthesis, a child envisioned an adventurous journey of manganese(I) catalysis full of obstacles, like the distant howls of wolves echoing through the night, with the ultimate goal of finding a general route to discover a linear, selective C&#8722;H dienylation method that leads to electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor dienes, glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. The synthetic application of this method is also eased to deliver the tricyclic core of Nagilactone. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. Subramanian and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301632).

         <title>Synthetic Strategies of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin (NHOs) and Their Recent Application of Organocatalytic Reactions and Beyond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) derivatives have an electron&#8208;rich as well as highly polarized carabon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond because of the electron&#8208;donating nature of nitrogen and sulphur atoms. While NHOs have been developing as novel organocatalysts and ligands for transition metal complexes in various organic compound syntheses, different research groups are currently interested in preparing imidazole and triazolium&#8208;based chiral NHO catalysts. Some of them have been used for enantioselective organic transformations, but were still elusive. N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins, the alkylidene derivatives of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) have shown promising results as effective promoters for numerous organic syntheses such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, alkylation, cycloaddition, polymerization and the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine and epoxides, esterification, C&#8208;F bond functionalization, amine coupling, trifluoromethyl thiolation, amination etc. NHOs catalysts with suitable structure can serve as a novel class of Lewis/Bronsted bases with strong basicity and high nucleophilicity properties. These facts strongly suggest their enormous chemical potential as sustainable catalysts for a wide variety of reactions in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of NHOs and their properties are briefly reviewed in this article, along with a summary of the imidazole and triazole core of NHOs' most recent catalytic uses.</dc:description>

         <title>Function&#8208;led Design of Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insufficient access to clean water and resources has emerged as one of the most pressing issues affecting people globally. Membrane&#8208;based ion separation has become a focal point of research for the generation of fresh water and the extraction of energy elements. This review encapsulates recent advancements in the selective ion transport of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes, accomplished by strategically pairing diverse monomers to create membranes with various pore sizes and environments for specific purposes. We first discuss the merits of using COF materials as a basis for fabricating membranes for ion separation. We then explore the development of COF membranes in areas such as desalination, acid recovery, and energy element extraction, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental principles of membrane design. Lastly, we address both theoretical and practical challenges, as well as potential opportunities in the targeted design of ion&#8208;selective membranes. The goal of this review is to stimulate future investigative efforts in this field, which is of significant scientific and strategic importance.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitrides from Supramolecular Crystals: From Single Atoms to Heterojunctions and Advanced Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nitride materials (CN) have become within the last 15 years in one of the most studied photocataysts. While CN absorbs visible light, its low porosity and fast electron &#8211; hole recombination hinder its photoelectric performance and have motivated the research in the modification of its physical and chemical properties (such as energy band structure, porosity, or chemical composition) by different means. In this perspective we focus on the utilization of supramolecular crystals as CN precursors to tailor its properties. We elaborate on the features needed in a supramolecular crystal to serve as CN precursor, we delve on the influence of metal&#8208;free crystals in the morphology and porosity of the resulting materials and then discuss the formation of single atoms and heterojunctions when employing a metal&#8208;organic crystal. We finally discuss the performance of CN photoanodes derived from crystals and highlight the current standing challenges in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular syringe for cargo photorelease &#8208; red&#8208;light&#8208;triggered supramolecular hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochromic supramolecular hydrogels are versatile materials that elicit macroscopic effects upon irradiation, like liquefaction or shape changes. Here we demonstrate a simple photochromic cyclic dipeptide (2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine&#8208;based) supergelator composed of (S)&#8208;lysine and an azobenzene analogue of phenylalanine, which forms supramolecular hydrogels already at 0.1&#160;wt% loading. The gels can physically encapsulate cargo molecules and release them to the environment in a controllable manner upon irradiation with red light, working as a &#8220;molecular syringe&#8221;. As the material is biocompatible and operational in the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221; of light (&gt;650&#160;nm) that deeply penetrates soft human tissues, it is applicable for smart drug delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Double&#8208;Electron Transfer Between A Pair of Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Units Aligned by Dithiolate Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using unconventional synthesis protocols, two redox&#8208;active triguanidine units are connected by a dithiolate bridge, aligning the two redox&#8208;active units in close proximity . The reduced, neutral and the tetracationic redox states with two dicationic triguanidine units are isolated and fully characterized, Then, the dicationic redox states are prepared by mixing the neutral and tetracationic molecules. At low temperatures, the dications are diamagnetic (singlet ground state) with two different triguanidine units (neutral and dicationic). At room temperature, the triplet state with two radical monocationic triguanidine units is populated. At low temperature (210 K), chemical exchange by intramolecular through&#8208;space electron&#8208;transfer between the two triguanidine units is evidenced by EXSY NMR spectroscopy. Intramolecular through&#8208;space transfer of two electrons from the neutral to the dicationic triguanidine unit is accompanied by migration of the couterions in opposite direction. The rate of double&#8208;electron transfer critically depends on the bridge. No electron&#8208;transfer is measured in the absence of a bridge (in a mixture of one dicationic and one neutral triguanidine), and relatively slow electron transfer if the bridge does not allow the two triguanidine units to approach each other close enough. The results give detailed, quantitative insight into the factors that influence intramolecular through&#8208;space double&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes.</dc:description>

Platinum&#8208;based bioprobes! The cationic in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Ag(I)&#8211;thiocholine coordination polyelectrolytes were shown to induce the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of anionic alkynylplatinum(II) bzimpy complexes via Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions to give low&#8208;energy red luminescence. By modulation of the self&#8208;assembly of the ensemble, new sensing strategies towards hydrogen peroxide and glucose were demonstrated.







Abstract
A new sensing strategy towards hydrogen peroxide based on metal coordination polyelectrolyte&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of alkynylplatinum(II) 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;yl)pyridine (bzimpy) complex was demonstrated. The cationic in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Ag(I)&#8211;thiocholine coordination polyelectrolytes were shown to induce the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of anionic low&#8208;energy red&#8208;emissive alkynylplatinum(II) bzimpy complexes via non&#8208;covalent Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The presence of hydrogen peroxide was shown to inhibit the formation of coordination polyelectrolytes and the coordination polyelectrolyte&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of platinum(II) complexes. The weakening of Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions was supported by UV&#8208;vis absorption, emission, and resonance light scattering (RLS) studies. The present assay was also applied to probe glucose indirectly based on the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase on the substrate. Operating in a label&#8208;free manner, together with the low&#8208;energy red emission and large Stokes shift of alkynylplatinum(II) complexes, these features render the proposed design attractive for biological applications.

         <title>Development of Fluorescent Isocoumarin&#8208;Fused Oxacyclononyne &#8211; 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pairs of isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN/1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were developed. The basis for creating IC9O&#8208;EWG is understanding the reason for the S1 state deactivation mechanism for their non&#8208;fluorescent analog IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies and eliminating this deactivation pathway through rational design.







Abstract
Fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes, which are reactive in SPAAC and give fluorescent triazoles regardless of the azide nature, have been developed. The key structural feature that converts the non&#8208;fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pair to its fluorescent counterpart is the pi&#8208;acceptor group (COOMe, CN) at the C6 position of the isocoumarin ring. The design of the fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pairs is based on the theoretical study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies. The calculations revealed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of the &#945;&#8208;pyrone cycle and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier could be increased by introducing a pi&#8208;acceptor group into a position that is in direct conjugation with the formed C=O group and has a reduced electron density in the transition state. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized two fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN bearing pi&#8208;acceptors at the C6 position. The importance of the nature of a pi&#8208;acceptor group was shown by the example of much less fluorescent CF3&#8208;substituted cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;CF3.

Organo photocatalyst: Visible light enabled metal&#8208;free redox&#8208;neutral direct C3&#8722;H alkylation/arylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with Inert alkyl and aryl chlorides have been reported.







Abstract
In the present manuscript, we reported the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;enabled direct C3&#8722;H alkylation/arylation of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones with unactivated alkyl/aryl chlorides under metal&#8208;free conditions. A wide range of unactivated alkyl and aryl chlorides containing different functionalities are coupled with a variety of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives under mild reaction conditions to afford the C3&#8208;alkyl/aryl substituted quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Substituted Phosphasilenes and its Rare Homologue Stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidinate stabilized low valent phosphasilenes &gt;Si=P&#8722; and a heavier homologue stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; are reported. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 are heavy analogues of imine or Schiff base. In both phosphorus compounds, Si exhibits double bond character. All compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and 1 and 2 also by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Herein we report the reduction of R&#8208;EX2 (E=P, Sb) with two equivalents of KC8 in the presence of silylene (LSiR; L=PhC(NtBu)2) to give Trip&#8208;P=SiL(C6H4PPh2) (1), TerPh&#8722;P=(tBu)SiL (2) and TerPh&#8722;Sb=(tBu)SiL (3). The last (3) belongs to a new class of heavier analogues of Schiff bases (&gt;C=N&#8722;), containing a formal &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; double bond. The theoretical calculations suggest that lone pairs on the dicoordinated group&#8208;15 centers are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions resulting in pseudo&#8208;Si&#8722;P/Si&#8722;Sb multiple bonds which are highly reactive as indicated by the high first and second proton affinities.

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8722;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence Mo species acts as Lewis acid sites to activate aldehyde groups and deliver strong metal&#8208;support interactions to enable metallic Pd centers toward the boosted amination of furfural with a high yield of 84&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8722;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8722;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8722;x supports can be easily ameliorated by varying the preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8722;x and highly dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84&#8201;%) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8722;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.

A Lewis acid catalyzed cascade aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction and [3+3]/[4+2] cycloaddition reaction to access octahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[b]pyridin&#8208;6&#8208;one, octahydro&#8208;5,7a&#8208;epoxycyclopenta[cd]isoindol&#8208;4&#8208;one and decahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;dicyclopenta[cd,hi]isoindol&#8208;6&#8208;one skeletons.







Abstract
Cascade aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction and [3+3]/[4+2] cycloaddition reactions are carried out using the ideality principles of pot, atom, and step economy (PASE) synthesis. The reaction resulted in generation of octahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[b]pyridin&#8208;6&#8208;one scaffolds. Moreover, octahydro&#8208;5,7a&#8208;epoxycyclopenta[cd]isoindol&#8208;4&#8208;one frameworks of gracilamine alkaloid and a novel decahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;dicyclopenta[cd,hi]isoindol&#8208;6&#8208;one were also realized in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cascade aza-Piancatelli reaction and [3+3]/[4+2] cycloaddition reactions are carried out using the ideality principles of pot, atom, and step economy (PASE) synthesis. The reaction resulted in generation of octahydro-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-cyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridin-6-one scaffolds. Moreover, octahydro-5,7a-epoxycyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;]isoindol-4-one frameworks of gracilamine alkaloid and a novel decahydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-dicyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;hi&lt;/i&gt;]isoindol-6-one were also realized in good yields with excellent regio- and diastereo-selectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable and Reusable Fe3O4/ZIF&#8208;8 Composite for Encapsulation of FDH Enzyme under Mild Conditions Applicable to CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ encapsulation of the formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme during the aqueous synthesis of ZIF&#8208;8 in the presence of magnetite yields a bio&#8208;composed system with long&#8208;time hydrostability and excellent reusability. The immobilization strategy enhances the catalytic activity in formic acid production from 300 (free FDH) to 1015&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio&#8208;composed system was constructed by in&#8208;situ encapsulation under mild conditions using formate dehydrogenase in a ZIF&#8208;8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF&#8208;8 in the enzyme's operation medium can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The bio&#8208;friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst, and the production of formic acid is improved 3.4&#8208;fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as concentrators of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio&#8208;composed system retains 86&#8201;% of its activity after a long time of five cycles, thus indicating an excellent magnetic recovery and a good reusability.

         <title>CH3CN@open&#8208;C60: An Effective Inner&#8208;Space Modification and Isotope Effect Inside a Nano&#8208;Sized Flask</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective inner&#8208;space modification was achieved by the encapsulation of a CH3CN. The polarity of the resulting molecular complex was enhanced, with a decreased LUMO level. Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD3CN compared with CH3CN was revealed.







Abstract
Despite several small molecules being encapsulated inside cage&#8208;opened fullerene derivatives, such species have not considerably affected the structures and properties of the outer carbon cages. Herein, we achieved an effective inner&#8208;space modification for an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative by insertion of a neutral CH3CN molecule into the cavity. The CH3CN@open&#8208;C60 thus obtained showed an enhanced polarity, thus affording an easy separation from a mixture containing the empty cage by column chromatography on silica gel, without the preparative HPLC that was needed for previous cases. The less negative reduction potentials with respect to those of empty cage reflect the decreased energy level of the LUMO, which is supported by the DFT calculations. NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and theoretical calculations revealed that both the presence of the encapsulated CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the CH3CN play an essential role in the change of the electronic properties. Furthermore, the favored binding affinity of deuterated acetonitrile CD3CN with internal C60 surface is discussed.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Ambiguity of Actinide(IV) Oxalate Sheet Structures: A Case for Alternate Coordination Geometries

Isolation of the first crystal structures of Pu(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O and Th(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O has resulted in the identification of a previously unreported change in oxalate coordination and the presence of two coordinated water molecules. This structure was determined to persist across the actinide(IV) series: Th, U, Np, and Pu.







Abstract
Plutonium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Pu(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; PuOx) is an important intermediate in the recovery of plutonium from used nuclear fuel. Its formation by precipitation is well studied, yet its crystal structure remains unknown. Instead, the crystal structure of PuOx is assumed to be isostructural with neptunium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Np(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; NpOx) and uranium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (U(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; UOx) despite the high degree of unresolved disorder that exists when determining water positions in the crystal structures of the latter two compounds. Such assumptions regarding the isostructural behavior of the actinide elements have been used to predict the structure of PuOx for use in a wide range of studies. Herein, we report the first crystal structures for PuOx and Th(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O (ThOx). These data, along with new characterization of UOx and NpOx, have resulted in the full determination of the structures and resolution of the disorder around the water molecules. Specifically, we have identified the coordination of two water molecules with each metal center, which necessitates a change in oxalate coordination mode from axial to equatorial that has not been reported in the literature. The results of this work exemplify the need to revisit previous assumptions regarding fundamental actinide chemistry, which are heavily relied upon within the current nuclear field.

         <title>Unlocking The Role of Guanidinium Salts in Interface Engineering for Boosted Performance of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial passivation of Guanidinium salts for inverted perovskite solar cells was systematically investigated. With the optimal benefit by reduced defects, the efficiency of 19.95&#8201;% is achieved for GuABr&#8208;modified solar cells with superior stability, which maintains 90&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1600&#8197;h under a relative humidity of 35&#8201;%&#8211;55&#8201;% for unencapsulated devices.







Abstract
NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large&#8208;scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge&#8208;extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr&#8208;treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600&#8197;h at 16&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and 35&#8201;%&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.

With the optimal benefit by reduced defects, the efficiency of 19.95&#8201;% is achieved for GuABr-modified solar cells with superior stability, which maintains 90&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1600&#8197;h under a relative humidity of 35&#8201;%&#8211;55&#8201;% for unencapsulated devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NiOx-based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large-scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge-extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non-radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr-treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600&#8197;h at 16&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and 35&#8201;%&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Palladium Catalyst Transfer on Benzoheterodiazoles as Acceptor Monomers and Discovery of Catalyst Transfer Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular catalyst transfer takes place on dibromobenzotriazole, but not on dibromobenzothiadiazole in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction and polycondensation reaction with tBu3PPd precatalyst. Furthermore, the addition of benzothiadiazole interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reaction of dibromophenylene with phenylboronic acid ester, in which the catalyst transfer occurs in the absence of any additive.







Abstract
Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with tBu3PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3&#8197;equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0&#8197;equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differences in the relative expression levels of cancer&#8208;related biomarker deliver key information about tumor progression. Herein, we developed a DNA windmill probe with four wind blades that could respond four mRNAs simultaneously and independently. The combination of four markers would present a superior picture for a particular cancer subtype, just like solving a jigsaw puzzle.







Abstract
Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in&#8197;situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.

@A_Le_Goff Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes (Le Goff**et al.).







Abstract
The immobilization of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (NiR) from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes is reported. It is demonstrated that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Difluorinated Saturated Heterocyclic Amines for Drug Discovery: Systematic Study of Their Physicochemical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208; and difluorination of azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine reduces basicity (pKa) and modulates lipophilicity (LogP) while retaining metabolic stability (CLint) in nearly all cases. Analysis of the obtained physicochemical data provides a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compounds&#8217; properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
A comprehensive study of physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and intrinsic microsomal clearance) within the series of mono&#8208; and difluorinated azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine derivatives was performed. While the number of fluorine atoms and their distance to the protonation center were the major factors defining the compound's basicity, both pKa and LogP values were affected considerably by the conformational preferences of the corresponding derivatives. For example, features of &#8220;Janus face&#8221; (facially polarized) cyclic compounds (i.&#8201;e., unusually high hydrophilicity) were identified for cis&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluoropiperidine, preferring a diaxial conformation. Intrinsic microsomal clearance measurements demonstrated high metabolic stability of the compounds studied (with a single exception of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine derivative). According to pKa &#8211; LogP plots, the title compounds provide a valuable extension of the fluorine&#8208;containing (e.&#8201;g., fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted) saturated heterocyclic amine series as building blocks for rational optimization studies in early drug discovery.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High monodeuteration efficiency has been achieved by flash generation of active intermediate and the subsequent external quenching by deuteration reagent with suppressing decomposition of the intermediate (external generation method), which has been achieved under microflow conditions with rapid mixing.







Abstract
In this study, incorporation of one deuterium atom was achieved by H&#8722;D exchange of one of the two identical methylene protons in various dihalomethanes (halogen=Cl, Br, and I) through a rapid&#8208;mixing microflow reaction of lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base and deuterated methanol as a deuteration reagent. Generation of highly unstable carbenoid intermediate and suppression of its decomposition were successfully controlled under high flow&#8208;rate conditions. Monofunctionalization of diiodomethane afforded various building blocks composed of boryl, stannyl, and silyl groups. The monodeuterated diiodomethane, which served as a deuterated C1 source, was subsequently subjected to diverted functionalization methods to afford various products including biologically important molecules bearing isotope labelling at specific positions and homologation products with monodeuteration.

         <title>Molecular Editing Enhances Oxidation Resistance of Menaquinone&#8208;Targeting Antibiotics Lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the oxidative stability of antibiotic lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2, we replaced the indole ring of their tryptophan residues with the benzofuran, benzothiophene, and 1&#8208;naphthalene rings. The synthetic 1&#8208;naphthalene analogues not only retained the original antibacterial activities, but also exhibited higher resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals.







Abstract
Lysocin E (1&#8201;a) and WAP&#8208;8294A2 (2&#8201;a) are peptidic natural products with 37&#8208; and 40&#8208;membered macrocycles, respectively. Compounds 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a have potent antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and share a unique mode of action. The electron&#8208;rich indole ring of d&#8208;Trp&#8208;10 of 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a interacts with the electron&#8208;deficient benzoquinone ring of menaquinone, which is a co&#8208;enzyme in the bacterial respiratory chain. Formation of the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex causes membrane disruption, leading to cell death. Despite the promising activities of 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a, the susceptibility of Trp&#8208;10 to oxidative degradation potentially deters the development of these compounds as antibacterial drugs. To address this issue, we replaced the indole ring with more oxidation&#8208;resistant aromatics having a similar shape and electron&#8208;rich character. Specifically, analogues with benzofuran (1&#8201;b/2&#8201;b), benzothiophene (1&#8201;c/2&#8201;c), and 1&#8208;naphthalene (1&#8201;d/2&#8201;d) rings were designed, and chemically prepared by full solid&#8208;phase total syntheses. Antibacterial assays of the six analogues revealed similar activities of 1&#8201;d/2&#8201;d and markedly reduced activities of 1&#8201;b/2&#8201;b and 1&#8201;c/2&#8201;c compared with 1&#8201;a/2&#8201;a. Equipotent 1&#8201;d and 2&#8201;d both showed high resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. Hence, the present study demonstrates a new molecular editing strategy for conferring oxidation stability on natural products with pharmacologically useful functions.

         <title>Selective Photodynamic Activity of Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrins with and without Acetyl Protecting Groups on Cancer and Normal Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetylated 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin&#8208;&#955;&#8208;carrageenan complex had more selective intracellular uptakes and photodynamic activity of cancer cells toward normal cells than the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin&#8208;&#955;&#8208;carrageenan complex. Furthermore, the complex improved the photodynamic activity during in&#8197;vivo experiments owing to its high blood retention.







Abstract
Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (1) and tetrakis(4&#8208;acetamidophenyl)porphyrin (2) were dissolved in water with the incorporation of a polysaccharide (&#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CGN)) as a water&#8208;solubilizing agent. Although the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably lower than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex, the selectivity index (SI; IC50 in a normal cell/IC50 in a cancer cell) of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably higher than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex. This is because the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was significantly affected by the intracellular uptakes by the normal and cancer cells. During in&#8197;vivo experiments, the CGN&#8208;2 complex inhibited tumor growth under light irradiation with high blood retention compared with the CGN&#8208;1 complex and Photofrin, which exhibited lower blood retention. This study showed that the photodynamic activity and SI are influenced by substituent groups of arene in the meso&#8208;positions of porphyrin analogs.

         <title>Front Cover: Insight into the Structural Ambiguity of Actinide(IV) Oxalate Sheet Structures: A Case for Alternate Coordination Geometries (Chem. Eur. J. 47/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old, limited data in the nuclear field is relied upon, but often requires revisiting for clarity. Like cracked glasses, flaws in old data can lead to missing information. Structural assumptions about PuIV oxalate hexahydrate have existed for decades, but only now has the structure been reported. These data have led to the identification of previously unreported coordination of water and changing oxalate positions across the isostructural AnIV series. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;K. Sockwell, A.&#8197;E. Hixon and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301164).

A polar CH3CN molecule has been encapsulated inside an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative under high pressure. The inserted CH3CN molecule has an impressive effect on the outer carbon cage, as shown by the enhanced polarity and decreased LUMO level. Crystallographic and computational analyses revealed that these changes were governed by the existence of the CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the insertion. Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD3CN compared with CH3CN was affirmed. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Murata and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301161).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A polar CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN molecule&lt;/b&gt; has been encapsulated inside an open-cage C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; derivative under high pressure. The inserted CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN molecule has an impressive effect on the outer carbon cage, as shown by the enhanced polarity and decreased LUMO level. Crystallographic and computational analyses revealed that these changes were governed by the existence of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN and cage deformation caused by the insertion. Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN compared with CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN was affirmed. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Murata and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202301161"&gt;10.1002/chem.202301161&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Cover Feature: External Flash Generation of Carbenoids Enables Monodeuteration of Dihalomethanes (Chem. Eur. J. 47/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 47, August 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover illustrates that the monoselective deuteration of diiodomethane mediated by lithium carbenoid is enabled by a flow microreactor. The monodeuterated diiodomethane obtained was used for the protection of catechols and Matteson&#8208;type homologation to generate single deuterium&#8208;labelled molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Nagaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301738).

         <title>Binary Metallic CuCo5S8 Anode for High Volumetric Sodium&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapid improvement of compact smart devices, fabricating anode materials with high volumetric capacity has gained substantial interest for future sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) applications. Herein, a novel bimetal sulfide CuCo5S8 material is proposed with enhanced volumetric capacity due to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity of the material and multi&#8208;electron transfer during electrochemical procedures. Due to the intrinsic metallic behavior, the conducting additive (CA) could be removed from the electrode fabrication without scarifying the high rate capability. The CA&#8208;free CuCo5S8 electrode can achieve a high volumetric capacity of 1436.4 mA h cm&#8722;3 at a current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and 100% capacity retention over 2000 cycles in SIBs, outperforming most metal chalcogenides, owing to the enhanced electrode density. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by combined measurements for sodium systems. The proposed new strategy offers a viable approach for developing innovative anode materials with high&#8208;volumetric capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Unprotected Indolines Through Intramolecular sp3 C&#8722;H Amination Using Nitroarenes as Aryl Nitrene Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free intramolecular benzylic sp3 C&#8722;H amination is disclosed using aryl nitro compounds as aryl nitrene precursors. Organosilicon reagent N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinylidene (Si&#8208;DHBP) served as an efficient reductant in the transformation, enabling the in&#8197;situ generation of aryl nitrene species for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindolines from the corresponding nitroarene compounds.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of molecules containing nitro groups in organic synthesis, innovative methods to expand the reactivity of this functional group are of interest in both industrial and academic settings. In this report, a metal&#8208;free intramolecular benzylic sp3 C&#8722;H amination is disclosed using aryl nitro compounds as aryl nitrene precursors. Organosilicon reagent N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinylidene (Si&#8208;DHBP) served as an efficient reductant in the transformation, enabling the in&#8197;situ generation of aryl nitrene species for the direct, metal&#8208;free synthesis of unprotected 2&#8208;arylindolines from the corresponding nitroarene compounds.

Magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the phenoxo&#8208;hydrazone scaffolded lanthanide dimers lead to first example of trityl&#8208;governed zero field Ln&#8208;SMMs







Abstract
The triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Trityl&#8208;appended mono&#8208; (HL1) and bis&#8208;compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1&#8211;4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of 1&#8211;6 were investigated, revealing that only ligand HL1 induces assemblies (1&#8211;4) capable of showing SMM behaviour, with Dy(III) congeners (1, 2) able to exhibit the phenomenon also under zero field conditions. Theoretical ab initio studies helped in determination of Dy(III) energetic levels, magnetic anisotropic axes and corroborated magnetic relaxation mechanisms to be a combination of Raman and quantum tunnelling in zero dc field, the latter being cancelled in the optimum non&#8208;zero dc field. Our work represents the first study of magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the trityl Ln&#8208;SMMs, leading to generation of slowly relaxing zero&#8208;field dysprosium complexes within the hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Type of Macrocyclic Architectures Used for Optoelectronic Materials and Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various macrocyclic architectures, ranging from the carbon&#8208;based macrocycles to the emerging heteroatom&#8208;doped macrocycles, have recently been established. This Minireview briefly overviews the latest advances in the design principle of macrocyclic systems as well as their applications in optoelectronic devices, supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has received much attention for decades. Macrocyclic architectures as representative receptors play a vital role in supramolecular chemistry and are applied in many fields such as supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition. However, the classical macrocycles generally lack functional groups in the scaffolds, which limit their further applications, especially in optoelectronic materials. Therefore, developing a new design principle is not only essential to better understand macrocyclic chemistry and the supramolecular behaviors, but also further expand their applications in many research fields. In recent years, the doping compounds with main&#8208;group heteroatoms (B, N, S, O, P) into the carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles offered a new strategy to build macrocyclic architectures with unique optoelectronic properties. In particular, the energy gaps and redox behavior can be effectively tuned by incorporating heteroatoms into the macrocyclic scaffolds. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize the design and synthesis of new macrocycles, and further discuss the related applications in optoelectronic materials and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective Sulfenyl Group Transfer Reactions of N&#8208;Sulfenylanilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
para&#8208;Selective rearrangement reactions of N&#8208;sulfenylanilides were efficiently promoted by silver catalysts under mild reaction conditions. This reaction proceeds by an intermolecular transfer of the sulfenyl group.







Abstract
Silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of N&#8208;sulfenylanilides afforded the corresponding p&#8208;sulfenylanilides in good to high yields with good para selectivity. The transformation has a high compatibility of functional groups, such as ester, bromo, and iodo groups. Mechanistic studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction proceeds through intermolecular transfer of the sulfenyl group.

         <title>Efficient Nitric Oxide Scavenging by Urea&#8208;Functionalized Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Modulates NO&#8208;Mediated Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The harmful effects of excess nitric oxide (NO) can be prevented by its scavenging. We show that a urea&#8208;functionalized molecule (Urea&#8208;eTCBD), rapidly binds to NO and forms a stable NONOate. The inhibition of NO&#8208;mediated, paw inflammation and corneal neovascularization by Urea&#8208;eTCBD, confirmed the biocompatibility and efficacy of the molecule. Additionally, Urea&#8208;eTCBD exhibited its potential for NO&#8208;sensing through a fluorescence turn&#8208;off mechanism.







Abstract
The excess nitric oxide (NO) produced in the body in response to bacterial/proinflammatory stimuli is responsible for several pathological conditions. The current approaches that target the production of excess NO, either through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enzyme or its downstream mediators have been clinically unsuccessful. With an aim to regulate the excess NO, urea&#8208;functionalized push&#8208;pull chromophores containing 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (TCBD) or expanded TCBD (eTCBD) were developed as NO scavengers. The NMR mechanistic studies revealed that upon NO binding, these molecules are converted to uncommon stable NONOates. The unique emissive property of Urea&#8208;eTCBD enables its application in&#8197;vitro, as a NO&#8208;sensor. Furthermore, the cytocompatible Urea&#8208;eTCBD, rapidly inactivated the NO released from LPS&#8208;activated cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the molecule in modulating NO&#8208;mediated pathological condition was confirmed using a carrageenan&#8208;induced inflammatory paw model and a corneal injury model. While the results confirm the advantages of scavenging the excess NO to address a multitude of NO&#8208;mediated diseases, the promising sensing and bioactivity of Urea&#8208;eTCBD can motivate further exploration of such molecules in allied areas of research.

         <title>Critical Issues of Vanadium&#8208;Based Cathodes Towards Practical Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide an overview of the key obstacles encountered by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes toward practical aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, encompassing dissolution, by&#8208;product formation, and limited ion diffusion. Additionally, it highlights the latest advancements made in tackling these challenges and proposes potential directions for future research in this domain.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are gaining significant attention for their numerous advantages, including high safety, high energy density, affordability, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that can store Zn2+ with high capacity and reversibility. Currently, vanadium&#8208;based materials with tunnel or layered structures are widely researched owing to their high theoretical capacity and diversified structures.

     alt="Critical Issues of Vanadium-Based Cathodes Towards Practical Aqueous Zn-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review aims to provide an overview of the key obstacles encountered by vanadium-based cathodes toward practical aqueous zinc-ion batteries, encompassing dissolution, by-product formation, and limited ion diffusion. Additionally, it highlights the latest advancements made in tackling these challenges and proposes potential directions for future research in this domain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are gaining significant attention for their numerous advantages, including high safety, high energy density, affordability, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that can store Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with high capacity and reversibility. Currently, vanadium-based materials with tunnel or layered structures are widely researched owing to their high theoretical capacity and diversified structures. However, their long-term cycling stability is unsatisfactory because of material dissolution, phase transformation, and restrictive kinetics in aqueous electrolytes, which limits their practical applications. Different from previous reviews on ZIBs, this review specifically addresses the critical issues faced by vanadium-based cathodes for practical aqueous ZIBs and proposes potential solutions. Focusing on vanadium-based cathodes, their ion storage mechanisms, the critical parameters affecting their performance, and the progress made in addressing the aforementioned problems are also summarized. Finally, future directions for the development of practical aqueous ZIB are suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gas Permeation through Mechanically Resistant Self&#8208;Standing Membranes of a Neat Amorphous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stand up and be tested: Self&#8208;standing membranes of a neat organic cage are reported here. The cage membranes showed a remarkably good mechanical resistance, which made them suitable for gas&#8208;permeation tests. This study pointed the possibility of using a simple organic cage molecule to achieve a molecular material with features that are generally observed with polymeric membranes.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel film&#8208;forming organic cage and of its smaller analogue are here described. While the small cage produced single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, the large one was isolated as a dense film. Due to its remarkable film&#8208;forming properties, this latter cage could be solution processed into transparent thin&#8208;layer films and mechanically stable dense self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to these peculiar features, the membranes were also successfully tested for gas permeation, reporting a behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides. Given the growing interest in the development of molecular&#8208;based membranes, for example for separation technologies and functional coatings, the properties of this organic cage were investigated by thorough analysis of their structural, thermal, mechanical and gas transport properties, and by detailed atomistic simulations.

By the combination of an Ugi&#8208;4CR and a transition metal&#8208;free selective N&#8722;S bond cleavage and C&#8722;N bond activation, diverse primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides were simultaneously obtained in a highly efficient, rapid, and step&#8208;economical manner. The reaction features broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and exclusive selectivity. Primary amides derived from the pharmaceuticals probenecid and febuxostat are also prepared.







Abstract
A novel method of transition metal&#8208;free N&#8722;S bond cleavage and subsequent C&#8722;N bond activation of Ugi&#8208;adducts was developed. Diverse primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides were prepared in a rapid, step&#8208;economical and highly efficient manner in two steps. This strategy features excellent chemoselectivity, high yield and functional&#8208;group tolerance. Primary amides derived from the pharmaceuticals probenecid and febuxostat were prepared. This method opens a new pathway for the simultaneous synthesis of primary amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides in an environmentally friendly manner.

         <dc:description>
Functionalized triose&#8208;, furanose and chromane&#8208;derivatives were synthesized by the titled reactions. The C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming cascade processes generate a functionalized sugar derivative with a quaternary stereocenter in a highly enantioselective fashion (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) by using a simple combination of metal and chiral amine co&#8208;catalysts. Notably, the interplay between the chiral sugar substrate and the chiral amino acid derivative allowed for the construction of a functionalized sugar product with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) also when using a combination of racemic amine catalyst (0&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and metal catalyst.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible hydrogen storage in the form of stable and mostly harmless chemical substances such as formic acid (FA) is a cornerstone of a fossil fuels&#8208;free economy. In the past, we have reported a primary amine&#8208;functionalized bifunctional iridium(III)&#8208;PC(sp3)P pincer complex as a mild and chemoselective catalyst for the additive&#8208;free decomposition of neat formic acid. In this manuscript, we report on the successful application of a redesigned complex bearing tertiary amine functionality as a catalyst for mild hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid. The catalyst demonstrates TON up to 6&#183;104 and TOF up to 1.7&#183;104 h&#8208;1. In addition to the practical value of the catalyst, experimental and computational mechanistic studies provide the rationale for the design of improved next&#8208;generation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Dication Diradicals of Triply&#8208;fused Metallo Chlorin&#8208;porphyrin Heterodimers: Impact of the Bridge on Control of Spin Coupling to Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report an unexpected rearrangement, controlled by the nature of bridge, leading to the formation of novel, remarkably stable triply&#8208;fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers in excellent yields in which dipyrromethane&#8208;bridge gets completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles with two new C&#8211;C and one C&#8211;N bonds. Two macrocycles exhibit extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the bridge which results in an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals. In addition, the macrocyclic distortion also favours a rare intramolecular ferromagnetic interaction between the Cu(II) and &#960;&#8208;cation radical spins to form a triplet state. The structural and electronic perturbation in the non&#8208;conjugated dication diradical possibly enables the bridging pyrrolic nitrogen to undergo a nucleophilic attack at the nearby &#946;&#8208;carbon of the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical with a computed free energy barrier of more than 20 kcal/mol which has been supplied in the form of reflux condition to initiate such rearrangement process. UV&#8208;vis, EPR and ESI&#8208;MS spectroscopies were utilized to monitor the rearrangement process in situ in order to identify key reactive intermediates leading to such an unusual transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Flexibility of Copper&#8208;Modified DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes Investigated by&#160;19F ENDOR Experiments at 34 GHz</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (GQs) are of great interest due to their involvement in crucial biological processes such as telomerase maintenance and gene expression. Furthermore, they are reported as catalytically active DNAzymes and building blocks in bio&#8208;nanotechnology. GQs exhibit remarkable structural diversity and conformational heterogeneity, necessitating precise and reliable tools to unravel their structure&#8208;function relationships. Here, we present insights into the structure and conformational flexibility of a unimolecular GQ with high spatial resolution via electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments combined with Cu(II) and fluorine labeling. These findings showcase the successful application of the&#160;19F&#8208;ENDOR methodology at 34 GHz, overcoming the limitations posed by the complexity and scarcity of higher&#8208;frequency spectrometers. Importantly, our approach retains both sensitivity and orientational resolution. This integrated study not only enhances our understanding of GQs but also expands the methodological toolbox for studying other macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Strain Energy of Diheteropnictogeniranes El2Pn (Pn = N, P, As, Sb)&#160;&#8211; Accurate versus Additive Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate ring strain energy (RSE) values for sixty&#8208;six parent pnictogeniranes having two other identical p&#8208;block elements, El2Pn, have been reported. A decrease in RSE was observed to correlate with an increase in the p character of the AO used in endocyclic bonds, which is particularly remarkable on descending the groups 15 and 16. The latter also parallels higher &#8208;NICS(1) values, which seems not to be related with an increase in aromaticity, as pointed out by other NICS&#8208;related criteria, but to atom&#8208;centred diatropic currents mostly arising from the presence of lone pairs. Only in case of pnictogenaditrieliranes Tr2Pn (Tr = B, Al, Ga), the decrease of &#8208;NICS(1) is related to a lower H&#252;ckel&#8208;type 2&#960;&#8208;electron aromaticity on descending group 13. The use of an additive methodology based on atom&#8208;strain contributions enables estimation of a large majority of all possible three&#8208;membered rings containing group 13&#8208;16 elements with modest accuracy (RMSE = 4.371 kcal/mol), that could be remarkably improved by using bond&#8208;strain contributions (RMSE = 1.183 kcal/mol).</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminium and gallium silylimides as nitride sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terminal aluminium and gallium imides of the type K[(NON)M(NR)] bearing heteroatom substituents at R have been synthesised via reactions of anionic aluminium(I) and gallium(I) reagents with silyl and boryl azides (NON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;anilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene). These systems vary significantly in their lability in solution: the N(SiiPr3) and N(Boryl) complexes are very labile, on account of the high basicity at nitrogen. Phenylsilylimido derivatives provide greater stabilization through the &#960;&#8208;acceptor capabilities of the SiR3 group. K[(NON)AlN(SitBuPh2)] offers a workable compromise between stability and solubility, and has been completely characterized by spectroscopic, analytical and crystallographic methods. The silylimide species examined feature minimal &#960;&#8208;bonding between the imide ligand and aluminium/gallium, with the HOMO and HOMO&#8208;1 orbitals effectively comprising orthogonal lone pairs centred at N. Reactivity&#8208;wise, both aluminium and gallium silylimides can act as viable sources of nitride, [N]3&#8208;, with systems derived from either metal reacting with CO to afford cyanide complexes. By contrast, only the gallium system K[(NON)Ga{N(SiPh3)}] is capable of effecting a similar transformation with N2O to yield azide, N3&#8208;, via formal oxide/nitride metathesis. The aluminium systems instead generate RN3 via transfer of the imide fragment [RN]2&#8208;.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Controlling Complex Morphologies of Isomorphous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique double&#8208;decker flower morphology is combined with homochirality and single crystallinity. A series of isomorphous crystals have been demonstrated and the flower&#8208;like morphology originates from the &#8216;stellate&#8217; intermediate.







Abstract
We demonstrate here how nitrate salts of bivalent copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, along with an achiral organic ligand, assemble into various structures such as symmetrical double&#8208;decker flowers, smooth elongated hexagonal bipyramids, and hexagonal prisms. Large morphological changes occur in these structures because of different metal cations, although they maintain isomorphous hexagonal crystallographic structures. Metal cations with stronger coordination to ligands (Cu and Ni) tend to form uniform crystals with unusual shapes, whereas weaker coordinating metal cations (Mn and Co) produce crystals with more regular hexagonal morphologies. The unusual flower&#8208;like crystals formed with copper nitrate have two pairs of six symmetrical petals with hexagonal convex centers. The texture of the petals indicates dendritic growth. Two different types of morphologies were formed by using different copper nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratios. An excess of the metal salt results in uniform and hexagonal crystals having a narrow size distribution, whereas the use of an excess of ligand results in double&#8208;decker morphologies. Mechanistically, an intermediate structure was observed with slightly concave facets and a domed center. Such structures most likely play a key role in the formation of double&#8208;decker crystals that can be formed by fusion processes. The coordination chemistry results in isostructural chiral frameworks consisting of two types of continuous helical channels. Four pyridine units from four separate ligands are coordinated to the metal center in a plane having a chiral (propeller&#8208;type) arrangement. The individual double&#8208;decker flower crystals are homochiral and a batch consists of crystals having both handedness.

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal conjugation has the potential to improve the speciation and cellular distribution of quinolines and subsequently broadening their spectrum of action as antimalarial drugs for multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Here, we provide an in&#8208;depth investigation of the chemistry and pharmacology of metal&#8208;quinoline complexes.







Abstract
Malaria is the one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Chemically, quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II)&#8208; and gold(I)&#8208;containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized, and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline&#8208;metal bond. RuII&#8208; and AuI&#8208;AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle as assayed in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal&#8208;AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle; this can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. Altogether, these findings indicate that metal coordination with antimalarial quinolines is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.

In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II)- and gold(I)-containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized, and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline-metal bond. Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;- and Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; life cycle as assayed in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal-AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle; this can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. Altogether, these findings indicate that metal coordination with antimalarial quinolines is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anchoring Polydopamine on ZnCo2O4 Nanowire To Facilitate Urea Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8208;shell structure ZnCo2O4@polydopamine (PDA) has been developed over nickel foam by a facile method to create an electrode with a hierarchical structure. The deposition of PDA enhances electrical conductivity by generating more active sites for efficient oxidation reactions, and can thus play a crucial role in the urea oxidation reaction. The electrode exhibits an excellent urea oxidation potential of 80&#8197;mV&#8201;vs. RHE at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 &#8211; less than that of water electrolysis &#8211; and shows excellent stability with no destruction in the developed core&#8208;shell structure.







Abstract
To overcome the sluggishness of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction was developed. In the case of OER application studies ZnCo2O4 is an excellent electrocatalyst, towards the UOR has been performed with surface&#8208;grown polydopamine (PDA) with surface&#8208;grown polydopamine (PDA). ZnCo2O4@PDA is produced over the surface of nickel foam by a hydrothermal method followed by self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride. Dopamine hydrochloride was varied in solution to study the optimal growth of PDA necessary to enhance the electrochemical activity. Prepared ZnCo2O4@PDA was characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electronic structural, and morphology/microstructure studies. With successful confirmation, the developed electrode material was applied to UOR and ZnCo2O4@PDA&#8208;1.5, delivering an excellent low overpotential of 80&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the electrolyte mixture of 1&#8197;M potassium hydroxide+0.33&#8197;M urea. To support the excellent UOR activity, other electrochemical properties such as the Tafel slope, electrochemical surface active sites, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also studied. Furthermore, a schematic illustration explaining the UOR mechanism is shown to allow a clear understanding of the obtained electrochemical activity. Finally, urea water electrolysis was carried out in a two&#8208;electrode symmetrical cell and compared with water electrolysis. This clearly showed the potential of the developed material for efficient electrochemical hydrogen production.

         <title>[3+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes with Azomethine Ylides &#8211; Access to Novel Fluorinated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthetic routes to series of difluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes are presented exploiting the cycloaddition of difluorocyclopropene and different azomethine ylides. Products containing the difluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane core along with a Z&#8208;configured vinyl fluoride are obtained when reacting proline esters with difluorocyclopropenes in a solvent&#8208;free thermal process.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorinated moieties into drugs as well as the increase of their overall three&#8208;dimensionality have become key strategies amongst medicinal chemists to generate sets of compounds with favorable drug&#8208;like properties. However, the introduction of fluorinated cyclopropane ring systems which combines both strategies is not widely exploited to date. This paper reports synthetic strategies exploiting the reactivity of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with azomethine ylides to afford sets of new fluorine&#8208;containing 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. In addition, the unexpected formation of complex trifluorinated scaffolds arising from proline esters and gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes is highlighted along with computational studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism. This study presents new avenues towards pharmaceutically relevant fluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes that are accessible via robust and short synthetic sequences.

         <title>Emerging Electrocatalysts in Urea Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea synthesis via an electrocatalytic technique from CO2 and N&#8208;containing feedstocks is a clean and sustainable approach to replace the Haber&#8208;Meiser process, in which the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts is vital to improve the activity and selectivity of urea production.







Abstract
Urea synthesis from abundant CO2 and N&#8208;feedstocks via renewable electricity has attracted increasing interests, offering a promising alternative to the industrial&#8208;applied Haber&#8208;Meiser process. However, the studies toward electrochemical urea production remain scarce and appeal for more research. Herein, in this perspective, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview on the urea electrosynthesis is highlighted and summarized. Firstly, the reaction pathways of urea formation through various feedstocks are comprehensively discussed. Then, we focus on the strategies of materials design to improve C&#8722;N coupling efficiency by identifying the descriptor and understanding the reaction mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and disadvantages in this field are reviewed and some future development directions of electrocatalytic urea synthesis are also prospected. This Minireview aims to promote future investigations of the electrochemical urea synthesis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) can be prepared by a CVD technique using the straight and uniform nanochannels of an anodic aluminium oxide film as a template (top left). The CNTTs are readily dispersed in water. Importantly, a significant number of DNA molecules are specifically attracted to the inner space of CNTTs (bottom left). This is due to the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA and the inner carbon surface. The numerous small yellow spheres in the cover represent Ca2+ cations. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Kyotani, T. Itoh, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301422).

         <title>Blatter diradicals with a spin coupler at the N(1) position</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of a benzo[e][1,2,4]triazine with dilithiobenzenes lead to di&#8208;Blatter diradicals connected at the N(1) positions via a spin coupling unit, 1,4&#8208;phenylene or 1,3&#8208;phenylene. Electrochemical analysis in MeCN revealed four one&#8208;electron redox processes separated by 0.1&#8211;0.3 V in both diradicals. Variable temperature EPR measurements in polystyrene (PS) solid solutions gave the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps &#916;ES&#8208;T = 2J of &#8208;3.02(11) and &#8208;0.16(1) kcal mol&#8208;1 for 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 1,3&#8208;phenylene derivatives, respectively. The latter negative value was attributed to conformational properties of the diradical in the PS solid solution. Results suggest a simple and efficient access to a family of stable Blatter diradicals with a controllable S&#8211;T gap through a judicious choice of the arylene coupling unit. DFT calculations indicate that the triplet state is stabilized by (het)arylenes with low LUMO.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Selectivity in the Annulation of&#160;o&#8208;Trifluoroacetylanilines and Activated Terminal Alkynes Based on Transition Metal and Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have developed selective methods for the synthesis of quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates and quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as well as (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates through copper&#8208;, silver&#8208;, or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of propiolates with 2'&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones. The approaches proposed ensure synthesis of substituted quinoline carboxylates and (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates in good yields. Introduction of alkynones into the reaction with 2'&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones gives acyl substituted derivatives in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoreduction of Anthracenes Catalyzed by peri&#8208;Xanthenoxanthene: a Scalable and Sustainable Birch&#8208;type Alternative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The typical Birch reduction transforms arenes into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes using alkali metals, an alcohol as a proton source, and an amine as solvent. Capitalizing on the strong photoreductive properties of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX), herein we report the photocatalyzed &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction of acenes employing visible blue light irradiation at room temperature in the presence of air. Upon excitation at 405 or 460 nm in the presence of a mixture of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and trifluoromethanesulfonimide (HNTf2) in DMSO, PXX photocatalyzes the selective reduction of full&#8208;carbon acene derivatives (24 &#8211; 75%). Immobilization of PXX onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) beads (PXX&#8208;PDMS) allowed the use of the catalyst in heterogeneous batch reactions, yielding 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene in high yields (68%). The catalyst could be easily recovered and reused, with no notable catalytic performance drop observed after five reaction cycles. Integration of the PXX&#8208;PDMS beads into a microreactor enabled the reduction of acenes under continuous flow conditions, thereby validating the sustainability and scalability of this heterogeneous phase approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Face&#8208;Capped Octahedra in a Tetrahedra Network &#8211; Structure Determination and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy of SrAl5P4N10O2F3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrAl5P4N10O2F3 was synthesized using a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction. Atomic&#8208;resolution EDX mapping with scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms the cation site assignment. Ten Al3+&#8208;centered octahedra form a condensed (Al(N,O,F)6)10 unit that is a novel structure motif in network compounds. Eu2+&#8208;doped SrAl5P4N10O2F3 shows blue emission when irradiated with UV light.







Abstract
Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates show a rich structural chemistry, which can be further extended by incorporating cations in higher coordinated positions, for example, in octahedral voids or by substituting the nitrogen atoms in the network with other anions. Following this approach, SrAl5P4N10O2F3 was synthesized at high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure conditions using a multianvil press (1400&#8201;&#176;C, 5&#8197;GPa) starting from Sr(N3)2, c&#8208;PON, P3N5, AlN, and NH4F. SrAl5P4N10O2F3 crystallizes in space group 
 with a=11.1685(2) and c=7.84850(10) &#197;. Atomic&#8208;resolution EDX mapping with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) indicates atom assignments, which are further corroborated by bond&#8208;valence sum (BVS) calculations. Ten Al3+&#8208;centered octahedra form a highly condensed tetra&#8208;face&#8208;capped octahedra&#8208;based unit that is a novel structure motif in network compounds. A network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra and chains of face&#8208;sharing Sr2+&#8208;centered cuboctahedra complement the structure. Eu2+&#8208;doped SrAl5P4N10O2F3 shows blue emission (&#955;em=469&#8197;nm, fwhm=98&#8197;nm; 4504&#8197;cm&#8722;1) when irradiated with UV light.

         <title>Far&#8208;Red Excitation Induced Electron Transfer in Bis Donor&#8208;AzaBODIPY Push&#8208;Pull Systems; Role of Nitrogenous Donors in Promoting Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor constructs featuring azaBODIPY and nitrogenous donors have been newly designed, synthesized and characterized using a range of physico&#8208;chemical techniques. Excited state charge transfer and separation, as a function of solvent polarity, is demonstrated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
A far&#8208;red absorbing sensitizer, BF2&#8208;chelated azadipyrromethane (azaBODIPY) has been employed as an electron acceptor to synthesize a series of push&#8208;pull systems linked with different nitrogenous electron donors, viz., N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NND), triphenylamine (TPA), and phenothiazine (PTZ) via an acetylene linker. The structural integrity of the newly synthesized push&#8208;pull systems was established by spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and DFT computational methods. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry studies revealed different redox states and helped in the estimation of the energies of the charge&#8208;separated states. Further, spectroelectrochemical studies performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell revealed diagnostic peaks of azaBODIPY&#8901;&#8722; in the visible and near&#8208;IR regions. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed the charge separation from one of the covalently linked donors to the 1azaBODIPY* to yield Donor&#8901;+&#8208;azaBODIPY&#8901;&#8722; to be energetically favorable in a polar solvent, benzonitrile, and the frontier orbitals generated on the optimized structures helped in assessing such a conclusion. Consequently, the steady&#8208;state emission studies revealed quenching of the azaBODIPY fluorescence in all of the investigated push&#8208;pull systems in benzonitrile and to a lesser extent in mildly polar dichlorobenzene, and nonpolar toluene. The femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies revealed the occurrence of excited charge transfer (CT) in nonpolar toluene while a complete charge separation (CS) for all three push&#8208;pull systems in polar benzonitrile. The CT/CS products populated the low&#8208;lying 3azaBODIPY* prior to returning to the ground state. Global target (GloTarAn) analysis of the transient data revealed the lifetime of the final charge&#8208;separated states (CSS) to be 195&#8197;ps for NND&#8208;derived, 50&#8197;ps for TPA&#8208;derived, and 85&#8197;ps for PTZ&#8208;derived push&#8208;pull systems in benzonitrile.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence Tetrametallic Iridium Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the structural and electronic properties by the axial capping ligand (X) in tetrametallic iridium chains featuring fractional averaged oxidation states of +1.5 and electronic delocalization along the metallic chain is reported. An appreciable red shift as the electronegativity (Allred&#8208;Rochow scale) decreases was observed in the UV&#8208;Vis spectra (see Figure).







Abstract
Neutral [X&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;X] (X=Cl, Br, SCN, I) and dicationic [L&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;L]2+ (L=MeCN, Me2CO) tetrametallic iridium chains made by connecting two dinuclear {Ir2} units ({Ir2}=[Ir2(&#956;&#8208;OPy)2(CO)4], OPy=2&#8208;pyridonate) by an iridium&#8211;iridium bond are described. The complexes exhibit fractional averaged oxidation states of +1.5 and electronic delocalization along the metallic chain. While the axial ligands do not significantly affect the metal&#8211;metal bond lengths, the metallic chain has a significant impact on the iridium&#8211;L/X bond distances. The complexes show free rotation around the unsupported iridium&#8208;iridium bond in solution, with a low&#8208;energy transition state for the chloride chain. The absorption spectra of these complexes show characteristic bands at 438&#8211;504&#8197;nm, which can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the terminal capping ligands.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modulation&lt;/b&gt; of the structural and electronic properties by the axial capping ligand (X) in tetrametallic iridium chains featuring fractional averaged oxidation states of +1.5 and electronic delocalization along the metallic chain is reported. An appreciable red shift as the electronegativity (Allred-Rochow scale) decreases was observed in the UV-Vis spectra (see Figure).

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With light excitation, triplet oxygen molecules (3O2; red dots) are converted to singlet oxygen (1O2; blue dots) through triplet photosensitization by the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene (BHH) molecule. The researcher is trying to increase the twist angle of BHH. As it increases, the stick indicating the percentage of 1O2 conversion moves towards 100. This illustrates how 1O2 conversion increases with increasing BHH twist angle, which is the main highlight of the work. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Mula and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301605).

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Crystal&#8208;Assisted Etching of Nickel Foam for the Collectively Exhaustive Electrochemical Performance of Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust self&#8208;standing electrode is developed based on NF etched by organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal for the collectively exhaustive electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The rate&#8208;limiting step and reaction kinetics of OER on the surface of the etched NF were investigated based on the anodic transfer coefficient (&#945;a) values obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis.







Abstract
In this work, an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal, violet&#8208;crystal (VC), was used to etch the nickel foam (NF) to fabricate a self&#8208;standing electrode for the water oxidation reaction. The efficacy of VC&#8208;assisted etching manifests the promising electrochemical performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring only ~356 and ~376&#8197;mV overpotentials to reach 50 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The OER activity improvement is attributed to the collectively exhaustive effects arising from the incorporation of various elements in the NF, and the enhancement of active site density. Furthermore, the self&#8208;standing electrode is robust, exhibiting a stable OER activity after 4,000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, and ~50&#8197;h. The anodic transfer coefficients (&#945;a) show that the first electron transfer step is the rate&#8208;determining step on the surface of NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 (NF etched by 1&#8197;g of VCs) electrode, while the chemical step involving dissociation following the first electron transfer step is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step in other electrodes. The lowest Tafel slope value observed in the NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 electrode indicates the high surface coverage of oxygen intermediates and more favorable OER reaction kinetics, as confirmed by high interfacial chemical capacitance and low charge transport/interfacial resistance. This work demonstrates the importance of VCs&#8208;assisted etching of NF to activate the OER, and the ability to predict reaction kinetics and rate&#8208;limiting step based on &#945;a values, which will open new avenues to identify advanced electrocatalysts for the water oxidation reaction.

         <title>2D Non&#8208;van der Waals Nanoplatelets&#160;of Hematene and Magnetene:&#160;Nonlinear Optical Response&#160;and Optical Limiting Performance&#160;from UV to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the preparation of some hematene and magnetene ultrathin non van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D nanoplatelets was reported starting from hematite and magnetite natural iron ores. The present work reports on the determination and evaluation of the nonlinear optical response and the optical limiting (OL) action of these 2D nanoplatelets dispersed in water under ns laser excitation. The obtained results show that both hematene and magnetene exhibit strong nonlinear absorption and refraction, comparable and even larger than those of other van der Waals (vdW) 2D counterpart materials. In addition, due to their strong nonlinear absorption, both hematene and magnetene show exceptional OL performance from the UV to visible, attaining very low values of optical limiting onset (OLon), comparable and even lower than that of vdW 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, graphene oxide, other transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2, black phosphorous and antimonene. Moreover, hematene was found to exhibit more efficient OL action than magnetene for all the excitation wavelengths studied, attributed to more efficient ligand to metal charge transfer. The present findings open new possibilities for the potential use of these non&#8208;vdW 2D materials in photonics and optoelectronics, e.g., as optical limiters and optical switchers.</dc:description>

         <title>Zn&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Using Triptycene Hexacarboxylate Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Gas&#8208;Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on zinc ions and two triptycene ligands of different size were synthesized under solvothermal conditions. The structural analyses revealed that these are isostructural three&#8208;dimensional&#8208;network MOFs. The high porosity and thermal stability of these MOFs can be attributed to the highly rigid triptycene&#8208;based ligands. Their BET specific surface areas depend on the size of the triptycene ligands. In contrast to these surface&#8208;area data, the H2 and CO2 adsorption of these MOFs is larger for MOFs with small pores. Consequently, we introduced functional groups to the bridge&#8208;head position of the triptycene ligands and investigated their effect on the gas&#8208;sorption properties. The corresponding results unveiled the role of the functional groups in the specific CO2 binding via an induced interaction between adsorbates and the functional groups. Excellent H2 and CO&#173;2 properties in these MOFs were achieved in the absence of open metal sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Gating Performance in Organic Molecular Field&#8208;Effect Transistors through Introducing Polar Azulene Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecular field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are promising building components for future electronic circuits. Efficient control of charge transport properties is one key issue in the design of organic molecular FETs. In this study, we propose a redesign of a naphthalene&#8208;based FET by introducing two azulene components in opposite dipole moment directions. Using density functional theory combined with non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function, the simulated electronic transport characteristics reveal that the introduction of polar azulene components effectively narrows the frontier molecular orbitals gap, leading to an increase in the ON&#8208;state current. Meanwhile, the OFF&#8208;state current is significantly suppressed by highly localizing the dominant electronic transport channel. As a result, improved gate controllability is achieved with a higher ON&#8208;OFF current ratio, which is nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the naphthalene&#8208;based FET device. These findings provide theoretical directions for future design of organic molecular FET devices with enhanced gating regulation efficiency.</dc:description>

Meanwhile, the OFF-state current is significantly suppressed by highly localizing the dominant electronic transport channel. As a result, improved gate controllability is achieved with a higher ON-OFF current ratio, which is nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the naphthalene-based FET device. These findings provide theoretical directions for future design of organic molecular FET devices with enhanced gating regulation efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The scope of the Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich reaction has been expanded to include crotylboronates as a variation of boronic ester. These have been examined in reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;heteroatom (F, OBz, OH) aldehydes and primary amines, to produce enantioenriched compounds up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 er. Examples have been converted to heterocyclic scaffolds with proof of absolute configuration.







Abstract
The crotylation reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;F, &#945;&#8208;OBz and &#945;&#8208;OH aldehydes under Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich conditions using (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;crotylboronates and primary amines resulted in &#947;&#8208;addition products in high dr and high er. &#945;&#8208;F and &#945;&#8208;OBz aldehydes gave 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn and 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;anti, products, respectively while an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde gave 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn products. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions of the former aldehydes can be explained using a six&#8208;membered ring transition state (TS) model in which a Cornforth&#8208;like conformation around the imine intermediate is favoured resulting in 1,2&#8208;anti products. The 2,3&#8208;stereochemical outcome is dependent upon the geometry of the crotylboronate. These TS models were also supported by DFT calculations. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions employing an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde can be rationalised as occurring via an open&#8208;TS involving H&#8208;bonding in the imine intermediate between the &#945;&#8208;OH group and the imine N atom. Representative products were converted to highly functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridines and 3H&#8208;oxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;ones which will be valuable scaffolds in synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The crotylation reactions of chiral &#945;-F, &#945;-OBz and &#945;-OH aldehydes under Petasis-borono-Mannich conditions using (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)- or (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-crotylboronates and primary amines resulted in &#947;-addition products in high dr and high er. &#945;-F and &#945;-OBz aldehydes gave 1,2-&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; and 1,2-&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;, products, respectively while an &#945;-OH aldehyde gave 1,2-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-&lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; products. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions of the former aldehydes can be explained using a six-membered ring transition state (TS) model in which a Cornforth-like conformation around the imine intermediate is favoured resulting in 1,2-&lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt; products. The 2,3-stereochemical outcome is dependent upon the geometry of the crotylboronate. These TS models were also supported by DFT calculations. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions employing an &#945;-OH aldehyde can be rationalised as occurring via an open-TS involving H-bonding in the imine intermediate between the &#945;-OH group and the imine N atom. Representative products were converted to highly functionalized 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines and 3&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-oxazolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine-3-ones which will be valuable scaffolds in synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The reversible coordination of anions to an&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted&#160;3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylurea&#160;located at a terminus of a linear chain of ethylene&#8208;bridged hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas triggers a cascade of conformational changes. A series of hydrogen&#8208;bond polarity reversals propagates along the oligomer, leading to a global switch of its hydrogen&#8208;bond directionality. The induced polarity switch, transmitted through four reversible urea groups, results in&#160;a change in emission and excitation wavelengths of a fluorophore located at the opposite terminus of the oligomer.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the facile synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E = Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with the phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent, Me3P&#8211;PMes*. Their reactivity towards a range of substrates with protic and hydridic E&#8211;H bonds (E = N, O, Si) is described. In addition to hydroelementation reactions of the E=P bonds, we show that these compounds, particularly [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn=PMes*, also act as base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes, allowing phosphinidene transfer to other nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Activation of Aryl Chlorides by Tuning the Radical Cation Properties of N&#8208;Phenylphenothiazines as Organophotoredox Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl chlorides as substrates for arylations present a particular challenge for photoredox catalytic activation due to their strong C(sp2)&#8209;Cl bond and their strong reduction potential. Electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;phenyl phenothiazines, as organophotoredox catalysts, are capable to cleave aryl chlorides simply by photoinduced electron transfer without the need for an additional electrochemical activation setup or any other advanced photocatalysis technique. Due to the extremely strong reduction potential in the excited state of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines the substrate scope is high and includes aryl chlorides both with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substituents. We evidence this reactivity for photocatalytic borylations and phosphonylations.&#160; Advanced time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry was the key to elucidate and compare not only the unusual photophysical properties of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, but also of their cation radicals as the central intermediates in the photocatalytic cycle. The revealed photophysics allowed the fine&#8208;tuning of the excited state and radical cation properties by the molecular design of the N&#8208;phenyl phenothiazines which improved the photocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), advanced cancer treatment utilizing nuclear fission of&#160;10B atom in cancer cells, is attracting increasing attention. As&#160;10B delivery agent, sodium borocaptate (10BSH), has been used in clinical studies along with L&#8208;boronophenylalanine. Recently,&#160;10BSH has been conjugated with lipids, polymers or nanoparticles to increase selectivity to and the retentivity in tumor. In this work, we designed the anticancer nanoformulations for BNCT consisting of poly(glycerol) functionalized detonation nanodiamonds (DND&#8208;PG) as a hydrophilic nanocarrier,&#160;10BSH as a dense boron&#8208;10 source, and phenylboronic acid or RGD peptide as an active targeting moiety. For their conjugation, some hydroxy groups in PG were oxidized to carboxy groups (DND&#8208;PG&#8208;COOH) to conjugate the active targeting moiety through amide linkage. Some hydroxy groups in DND&#8208;PG&#8208;COOH were then transformed to azide to conjugate&#160;10BSH through click chemistry. After qualitative and quantitative characterization, the nanodrugs were evaluated&#160;in vitro&#160;using B16 murine melanoma cells in terms of cell viability and BNCT efficacy. As a result, the nanodrugs with and without the targeting moiety exhibited good anticancer efficacies with slight differences upon thermal neutron irradiation. By TEM observation,&#160;10BSH moiety was found to facilitate the cellular uptake more efficiently than the active targeting moieties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3) towards BeCl2, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6]3 was investigated.

         <title>Development of Lysine Crotonyl&#8208;mimic Probe to Covalently Identify H3K27Cr Interacting Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is one newly discovered acylation modification and regulates numerous pathophysiological processes. The binding affinity between Kcr and its interacting proteins is generally weak, which makes it difficult to effectively identify Kcr&#8208;interacting partners. Changing the amide of crotonyl to an ester increased reactivity with proximal cysteines and retained specificity for Kcr antibody. We then designed the probe &#8220;H3g27Cr&#8221; by incorporating the ester functionality into a H3K27 peptide. Using this probe, we successfully identified multiple Kcr&#8208;interacting partners including STAT3, which had not reported previously. Further experiments suggested that STAT3 possibly could form complexes with Histone deacetylase HDACs to downregulate the acetylation and crotonylation of Histone H3K27. Our unique design provided intriguing tools to further explore Kcr&#8208;interacting proteins and elucidate their working mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Investigation of Intercellular Heterogeneity via Multiple Photocaged Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercellular heterogeneity can be demonstrated and characterized by total proteomic and cysteinomic analysis using multiple photocaged probes, including a locator, a ROS event trigger and a Cys&#8208;labeling probe, under regional irradiation schemes.







Abstract
Intercellular heterogeneity occurs widely under both normal physiological environments and abnormal disease&#8208;causing conditions. Several attempts to couple spatiotemporal information to cell states in a microenvironment were performed to decipher the cause and effect of heterogeneity. Furthermore, spatiotemporal manipulation can be achieved with the use of photocaged/photoactivatable molecules. Here, we provide a platform to spatiotemporally analyze differential protein expression in neighboring cells by multiple photocaged probes coupled with homemade photomasks. We successfully established intercellular heterogeneity (photoactivable ROS trigger) and mapped the targets (directly ROS&#8208;affected cells) and bystanders (surrounding cells), which were further characterized by total proteomic and cysteinomic analysis. Different protein profiles were shown between bystanders and target cells in both total proteome and cysteinome. Our strategy should expand the toolkit of spatiotemporal mapping for elucidating intercellular heterogeneity.

         <title>Strong Be&#8722;N Interaction Induced Complementary Chemical Tuning to Design a Dual&#8208;gated Single Molecule Junction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing quantum mechanical calculations and theoretical modeling, we have demonstrated the design of a dual&#8208;gated single molecule junction where the strong Be&#8722;N beryllium bond acts as a primary gate to regulate the electronic current through the SMJ and the substituents at the para position of the substituted pyridine cater additional control for further manipulation of the gated current.







Abstract
The interaction between pyridines and the &#960;&#8208;hole of BeH2 leads to the formation of strong beryllium&#8208;bonded complexes. Theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Be&#8722;N bonding interaction can effectively regulate the electronic current through a molecular junction. The electronic conductance exhibits distinct switching behavior depending on the substituent groups at the para position of pyridine, highlighting the role of Be&#8722;N interaction as a potent chemical gate in the proposed device. The complexes exhibit short intermolecular distances ranging from 1.724 to 1.752&#8197;&#197;, emphasizing their strong binding. Detailed analysis of electronic rearrangements and geometric perturbations upon complex formation provides insights into the underlying reasons for the formation of such strong Be&#8722;N bonds, with bond strengths varying from &#8722;116.25 to &#8722;92.96&#8197;kJ/mol. Moreover, the influence of chemical substituents on the local electronic transmission of the beryllium&#8208;bonded complex offers valuable insights for the implementation of a secondary chemical gate in single&#8208;molecule devices. This study paves the way for the development of chemically gateable, functional single&#8208;molecule transistors, advancing the design and fabrication of multifunctional single&#8208;molecule devices in the nanoscale regime.

         <title>The Role of Crystalline Intermediates in Mechanochemical Cyclorhodation Reactions Elucidated by in&#8208;Situ X&#8208;ray Powder Diffraction and Computation</title>

In&#8208;situ monitoring by synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and computational methods enabled the formation of crystalline intermediates in mechanochemical cyclorhodation reactions to be studied.







Abstract
The occurrence of crystalline intermediates in mechanochemical reactions might be more widespread than previously assumed. For example, a recent study involving the acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation of N&#8722;Heterocycles with [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling revealed the formation of transient cocrystals between the reagents prior to the C&#8722;H activation step. However, such crystalline intermediates were only observed through stepwise intervallic ex&#8208;situ analysis, and their exact role in the C&#8722;H activation process remained unclear. In this study, we monitored the formation of discrete, stoichiometric cocrystals between benzo[h]quinoline and [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling using in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This continuous analysis revealed an initial cocrystal that transformed into a second crystalline form. Computational studies showed that differences in noncovalent interactions made the [Cp*RhCl2]2 unit in the later&#8208;appearing cocrystal more reactive towards NaOAc. This demonstrated the advantage of cocrystal formation before the acetate&#8208;assisted metalation&#8211;deprotonation step, and how the net cooperative action of weak interactions between the reagents in mechanochemical experiments can lead to stable supramolecular assemblies, which can enhance substrate activation under ball&#8208;milling conditions. This could explain the superiority of some mechanochemical reactions, such as acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation, compared to their solution&#8208;based counterparts.

Abstract
A general pathway towards NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene)&#8208;stabilized galliummonotriflates NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GaH2(OTf) (NHC=IDipp, 1&#8201;a; IPr2Me2, 1&#8201;b; IMes, 1&#8201;c; IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IPr2Me2=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(diisopropyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) is reported. Quantum chemical calculations give detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathway. The obtained NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GaH2(OTf) compounds were employed in reactions with donor&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes to synthesize the elusive cationic parent 13/15/13 chain compounds [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GaH2ER2E'H2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;D][OTf] (3&#8201;a: D=IDipp, E=P, E&#8217;=B, R=H; 3&#8201;b: D=NMe3, E=P, E&#8217;=B, R=H, 3&#8201;c: D=NMe3, E=P, E&#8217;=B, R=Ph, 3&#8201;d: D=IDipp, E=P, E&#8217;=Ga, R=H).

Automated synthesis of multiblock copolymers: A robotic polymer synthesis platform conducts polymerization to produce multiblock copolymers with block sequence definition. The synthesis protocol for these complex structures is given to the automation platform via a computer interface, where the protocol created by humans is translated into computer codes for the automation system to recognise. This platform enables access to complex multiblock structures not generally accessible through manual synthesis techniques. More information can be found in the Research Article by G.&#8197;G.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminium Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;stabilized highly electrophilic monomeric aluminium cations with alkoxy substituents have been introduced. The Guttman&#8211;Beckett method and hydride ion affinity calculations affirm that alkoxy groups enhance the electrophilicity of these cations. We also illustrate their catalytic application for reactions such as ether activation, hydrosilylation of alkene and carbonyls. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Singh and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301229). Manu Adhikari&#8216;s background image is gratefully acknowledged.

         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COF) particles with hydroxy groups and well&#8208;defined micropores have been synthesized and used as novel carriers to load a metallocene catalyst&#8212;Cp2ZrCl2. The resulting supported catalyst, which had a high specific surface area, demonstrated higher catalytic activity, better thermal tolerance, and a unique nanoconfinment effect during ethylene polymerization, producing polyethylene with a higher molecular weight, increased crystallinity, and highly improved mechanical performance.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted One Pot Cascade Conversion of Furfural to &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over Sc(OTf)3</title>

Microwave&#8208;assisted one pot cascade transformation of furfural to &#947;&#8208;valerolactone catalyzed by Sc(OTf)3.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) is considered as a star biochemical which can be used as a green solvent, fuel additive and versatile organic intermediate. In this study, metal triflate (M(OTf)n) was utilized as the catalyst for one&#8208;pot transformation of furfural (FF) to GVL in alcohol media under microwave irradiation. Alcohol plays multiple functions including solvent, hydrogen donor and alcoholysis reagent in this cascade reaction process. And process efficiency of GVL production from FF upgrading is strongly related to the effective charge density of selected catalyst and the reduction potential of selected alcohol. Complex (OTf)n&#8208;M&#8722;O(H)R, presenting both Br&#248;nsted acid and Lewis acid, is the real catalytic active species in this cascade reaction process. Among various catalysts, Sc(OTf)3 exhibited the best catalytic activity for GVL production. Various reaction parameters including the Sc(OTf)3 amount, reaction temperature and time were optimized by the response surface methodology with the central composite design (RSM&#8208;CCD). Up to 81.2&#8201;% GVL yield and 100&#8201;% FF conversion were achieved at 143.9&#8201;&#176;C after 8.1&#8197;h in the presence of 0.16&#8197;mmol catalyst. This catalyst exhibits high reusability and can be regenerated by oxidative degradation of humins. In addition, a plausible cascade reaction network was proposed based on the distribution of product.

         <title>Photoactivation of Solid&#8208;State Fluorescence through Controllable Intermolecular [2+2] Photodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient photoactivation behavior of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence of a variety of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide derivatives luminogens is achieved based on a controllable self&#8208;assembly and efficient intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction, which provides a simple and effective pathway to construct smart photoresponsive materials and fresh AIEgens with excellent photostability in purely through&#8208;space conjugation.







Abstract
Intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization provides a distinctive approach to construct photoresponsive fluorescent materials in a manner of switching on solid&#8208;state fluorescence. Herein, we report efficient photoactivation of bright solid&#8208;state fluorescence based on controllable intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization reaction of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide (BTO) derivatives, which provides a simple and effective way to construct smart photoresponsive solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials. Rational choice of substituents in BTO molecular skeleton enables them to efficiently undergo photodimerization through regulating molecular stacking in crystal, and also leads to photoactivation of solid&#8208;state fluorescence due to the generation of brightly fluorescent photodimers. This intermolecular photodimerization reaction also offers an effective method to synthesize photostable AIEgens with purely through&#8208;space conjugation.

         <title>Superhydrophilic and Superaerophobic Ru&#8208;Loaded NiCo Bimetallic Hydroxide Achieves Efficient Hydrogen Evolution over All pH Ranges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile and effective strategy to synthesize Ru NPs anchored on NiCo&#8208;BH by spontaneous redox reactions as high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalysts at all pH values. The Ru&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) interfacial bond between Ru nanoparticles and Ni&#8722;Co is beneficial to mass transfer in HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68 and 80&#8197;mV, a 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively.







Abstract
Realizing an effective, binder&#8208;free, and super&#8208;wetting electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at full pH is essential for the creation of clean hydrogen. In this study, the Ru&#8208;loaded NiCo bimetallic hydroxide (Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH) catalyst was prepared by spontaneous redox reaction. The chemical interaction between Ru NPs and NiCo&#8208;BH by the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;M (M=Ni, Co) interface bond, the electron&#8208;rich Ru active site, and the multi&#8208;channel nickel foam carrier make the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface advantageous for mass transfer in the HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68 and 80&#8197;mV, a 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes respectively. This work provides a reference for the rational development of universal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in the all pH ranges through simple design strategies.

         <title>The Cyanido&#8208;Sulfate Anion [SO3CN]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur trioxide acts as a strong oxidizer towards halides as well as pseudohalides. Therefore, reactions of sulfur trioxide with cyanide anions do usually not lead to the formation of cyanido&#8208;sulfates anion but to oxidation of the cyanide ion. This problem can be avoided if a sulfur trioxide&#8208;pyridine complex is used instead of neat sulfur trioxide. In this way, the oxidation power is sufficiently reduced, and the pyridine molecule can be replaced by the cyanide anion under formation of the cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, SO3CN&#8722;. Thus sulfur trioxide gets rid of the badly smelling pyridine molecule, however, at the expense of gaining the toxic cyanide anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;S. Wickleder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301761).

         <title>Catalytic Inhibition of Base&#8208;Mediated Reactivity by a Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Ligand Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spacious M4L6 tetrahedra can act as catalytic inhibitors for base&#8208;mediated reactions. Upon adding only 5 % of a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex, the conversion of the conjugate addition between ethylcyanoacetate and &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene catalyzed by proton sponge can be reduced from 83 % after 75 mins at ambient temperature to &lt;1 % under identical conditions. The mechanism of the catalytic inhibition is unusual: the octacationic Fe4L6 cage increases the acidity of exogenous water in the acetonitrile reaction solvent by favorably binding the conjugate acid of the basic catalyst. The inhibition only occurs for Fe4L6 hosts with spacious internal cavities: minimal inhibition is seen with smaller tetrahedra or Fe2L3 helicates. The surprising tendency of the cationic cage to preferentially bind protonated, cationic ammonium guests is quantified via the comprehensive modeling of spectrophotometric titration datasets.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In expanding our research activities of superlattice engineering, designing new giant molecules is the necessary first step. One attempt is to use inorganic transition metal clusters as building blocks. Efficient functionalization of chemically precise transition metal clusters, however, remains a great challenge to material scientists. Herein, we report an efficient thiol&#8208;Michael addition approach for the modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster (CTOC). Several advantages, including high efficiency, mild reaction condition, capability of complete addition, high atom economy, as well as high functional group tolerance were demonstrated. This approach can afford high yields of fully functionalized CTOCs, which provides a powerful platform for achieving versatile functionalizations of precise transition metal clusters and further applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gallium&#8208;based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell (~6.5 nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500 cycles with a capacity of 455 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (in situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge. This study elucidates the design of advanced liquid alloy&#8208;based negative electrode materials for high&#8208;performance liquid metal batteries (LMBs).</dc:description>

         <title>Antibactericidal Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Alkaloid Conjugate and Their Interactions with Biomolecules: a Case of N&#8208;methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phosphine ligand (Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, PNMPEA) obtained by the reaction of the (hydroxymethyl)diphenylphosphine with naturally occurring alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine, was used to synthesize the half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) (Ir(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, IrPNMPEA) and ruthenium(II) (Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, RuPNMPEA) complexes. They were characterized using a vast array of methods, including 1D and 2D NMR, ESI(+)MS spectrometry, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spectroscopy in the UV&#8208;Vis range (absorption, fluorescence) and density functional theory (DFT). The initial antimicrobial activity in vitro toward Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains was examined, indicating that both complexes are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, where the IrPNMPEA has been more bactericidal compared to RuPNMPEA. Additionally, the interactions of these compounds with various biomolecules, such as DNA (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine (9&#8208;EtG), and 9&#8208;methyladenine (9&#8208;MeA)), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid (Asc) were described. The results showed that both Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes accelerate the oxidation process of NADH, GSH and Asc that appeared to occur by an electron transfer mechanism. Interestingly, only IrPNMPEA leads to the formation of various biomolecule adducts, which can explain its higher activity. Furthermore, RuPNMPEA and IrPNMPEA have been interacting with the DNA through weak noncovalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Hydrogels with Opaque&#8208;Transparent Gradient Transition for Switchable Window and Temperature Monitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the thermochromic hydrogel was acted as suitable sandwiching material to adjust light transmission. However, to accurately control the thermochromic temperature in a wide range still was a significant challenge. Here, a simple method was explored to prepare hydrogels with gradient opaque&#8208;transparent transition thermochromic temperature from 5 &#176;C to 53 &#176;C, which was regulated by the aggregation state of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by adding potassium tartrate hemihydrate and positive ions. The positive ions, including Li+, Na+, and K+, and the accuracy was controlled at 1 &#176;C. Moreover, the transmittance of the hydrogel was not changed when the thermochromic temperature was adjusted. As a result, an intelligent window was fabricated by utilizing thermochromic hydrogel as a sandwiching layer into the outer glass layers, which could effectively and stably regulate the visible and infrared light. The temperature monitors/detectors were also designed, which showed excellent temperature monitoring/detecting ability. Therefore, this low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficient, large&#8208;scale prepared thermochromic hydrogel provided more potential for intelligent temperature devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the Ga(I) cation for bond activation: from oxidative additions into C&#8722;Cl and H&#8722;P bonds to reversible insertion into P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the discovery of the Ga(I) complex salt [Ga(PhF)2&#8208;3][Al(ORF)4] (RF = C(CF3)) invoked the preparation of a diverse library of cationic Ga(I) coordination complexes and clusters, studies on small molecule activation with low&#8208;valent Ga(I) cations are scarce. Here, a first experimental study on the reactivity of a monomeric Ga(I) cation activated with a pyridine&#8208;diimine pincer&#8208;ligand (in [Ga(PDIdipp)][Al(ORF)4]) towards small&#8208;molecules is reported. First controlled oxidative additions of the Ga(I) cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds are presented. Moreover, the [4+1] cycloaddition to butadienes was achieved. Intriguingly, the isolated, blue insertion product into the P&#8722;P bond of P4 allows for quantitative release of the P4 molecule upon reaction with AlEt3 and butadienes. Reversible P4 insertion of main&#8208;group metals has previously on been reported for Ge and Sn respectively. The experimental study is supported by high level computational analysis of the in part reversible oxidative additions at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c/def2&#8208;mSVP level of theory with COSMO&#8208;RS solvation in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Iminoboranes With Parent B=NH Entity: Imino Group Metathesis, Nucleophilic Reactivity and N&#8722;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While R2C=N&#8722;R double bonds in organic imines are well established, the related iminoboranes R&#8722;B=N&#8722;R are either prone to oligomerization or can only be stabilized at sufficient steric congestion. In particular, the examples of unsubstituted parent B=N&#8722;H entity are rare. We demonstrate that the amino imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm) not only gives rise to the isolation of a parent (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H iminoborane, but also to species of type (AmIm)B=N&#8722;SiMe3 with concomitant stabilization by lithium bromide. The double bond character in these systems is unambiguously corroborated by DFT calculations. The steric accessibility of the (AmIm)B=NH unit allows facile reactivity including metathesis reactions with C=O and C=S bonds, nucleophilic addition toward organic and organometallic carbonyl compounds, but also oxidative N&#8722;N coupling within a dimeric unit. Thus, the chemical behavior of the (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H and (AmIm)B=N&#8722;SiMe3 is distinctly different from that of organic imines.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Chromic Properties of Viologen&#8208;Metal Polymers Modulated by Coordination Modes for Inkless Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inkless and erasable printing (IEP) based on chromic materials holds great promise to alleviate environmental and sustainable problems. Metal&#8208;organic polymers (MOPs) are bright platforms for constructing IEP materials. However, it is still challenging to design target MOPs with excellent specific functions rationally due to the intricate component&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, an effective strategy was proposed for the rational design IEP&#8208;MOP materials. The stimuli&#8208;responsive viologen moiety was introduced into the construction of MOPs to give it potential chromic behaviors and two different coordination models (i.e. bilateral coordination model, M1; unilateral coordinated model, M2) based on the same viologen ligand were designed. Aided by theoretical calculations, model M1 was recommended secondarily as a more suitable system for IEP materials. Along this line, two representative viologen&#8208;ZnII MOPs 1 and 2 with models M1 and M2 were synthesized successfully. Experiments exhibit that 1 does have quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast and longer radical lifetime compared to 2. Significantly, the obtained 1&#8208;IEP media brightly inherits the excellent chromic characteristics of 1 and the flexibility of the paper at the same time, which achieves most daily printing requirements, as well as enough resolution and durability to be used in identification by smart device.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Prediction of Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Using a 2D Catalyst Composed of 3d Transition Metal and Hexaamine Dipyrazino Quinoxaline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metals and organic ligands combine to form metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess distinct active sites, large specific surface areas and stable porous structures, giving them considerable promise for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. In the present study, using spin polarisation density&#8208;functional theory, a series of 2D MOFs constructed from 3d transition metal and hexamethylene dipyrazoline quinoxaline were investigated. The calculated binding energies between HADQ and metal atoms for the ten TM&#8208;HADQ monolayers were strong sufficient to stably disperse the metal atoms in the HADQ monolayers. Of the ten catalysts tested, seven (Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ti, V and Cr) exhibited high CO2 reduction selectivity, while Mn, Fe and Co required pH values above 2.350, 6.461 and 6.363, respectively, to exhibit CO2 reduction selectivity. HCOOH was the most important producer for Sc, Zn, Ni and Mn, while CH4 was the main producer for Ti, Cr, Fe and V. The Cu&#8208;HADQ catalyst had a high overpotential for the HCHO product (1.022 V), while the other catalysts had lower overpotentials between 0.016V and 0.792V.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transition metals and organic ligands combine to form metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess distinct active sites, large specific surface areas and stable porous structures, giving them considerable promise for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. In the present study, using spin polarisation density-functional theory, a series of 2D MOFs constructed from 3d transition metal and hexamethylene dipyrazoline quinoxaline were investigated. The calculated binding energies between HADQ and metal atoms for the ten TM-HADQ monolayers were strong sufficient to stably disperse the metal atoms in the HADQ monolayers. Of the ten catalysts tested, seven (Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ti, V and Cr) exhibited high CO2 reduction selectivity, while Mn, Fe and Co required pH values above 2.350, 6.461 and 6.363, respectively, to exhibit CO2 reduction selectivity. HCOOH was the most important producer for Sc, Zn, Ni and Mn, while CH4 was the main producer for Ti, Cr, Fe and V. The Cu-HADQ catalyst had a high overpotential for the HCHO product (1.022 V), while the other catalysts had lower overpotentials between 0.016V and 0.792V. Thus, these results predict TM-HADQ to show excellent activity in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction and to become a promising electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;catalyzed&#160;&#945;&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using recyclable silica&#8208;supported heteroleptic and homoleptic copper(I) photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Earth&#8208;abundant photosensitizers are highly sought after for light&#8208;mediated applications, such as photoredox catalysis, depollution and energy conversion schemes. Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes are promising candidates in this field, as copper is abundant and the corresponding complexes are easily obtained in smooth conditions. However, some heteroleptic copper(I) complexes suffer from low (photo)stability that leads to the gradual formation of the corresponding homoleptic complex. Such degradation pathways are detrimental, especially when recyclability is desired. In here, we report a novel approach for the heterogenization of homoleptic and heteroleptic Cu complexes on silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the photophysical properties upon surface immobilization were only slightly affected. Excited&#8208;state quenching with aryl diazonium derivatives occurred efficiently (108&#8208;1010&#160;M&#8211;1&#160;s&#8211;1) with heterogeneous and homogeneous photosensitizers. Moderate but almost identical yields were obtained for the&#160;a&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using the homoleptic complex in homogeneous or heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the silica&#8208;supported photocatalysts were recycled with moderate loss in photoactivity over multiple experiments. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that excited&#8208;state electron transfer occurred from the homogeneous and heterogeneous homoleptic copper(I) complexes to aryl diazonium derivatives, generating the corresponding copper(II) center that persisted for several hundreds of microseconds, compatible with photoredox catalysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Interactions Between Chiral Plasmonic Nanoparticles and Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (and their assemblies) interact with biomolecules in a variety of different ways, resulting in distinct optical signatures when probed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. These systems show promise for biosensing applications and offer several advantages over achiral plasmonic systems. Arguably, the most notable advantage is that chiral nanoparticles can differentiate between molecular enantiomers and can, therefore, act as sensors for enantiomeric purity. Furthermore, chiral nanoparticles can couple more effectively to chiral biomolecules in biological systems if they have a matching handedness, improving their effectiveness as biomedical agents. In this article, we review the different types of interactions that occur between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules, discuss how circular dichroism spectroscopy can probe these interactions, and inform how to optimize systems for biosensing and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Fluorinated functionalization of Linker on Quercetin Encapsulation, Release and Hela Cell Cytotoxicity of Cu&#8208;Based MOFs as Smart pH&#8208;Stimuli Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled delivery of target molecules is required in many medical and chemical applications. For such purposes, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity, large surface area, and tunable functionalities are promising carriers. Herein, Quercetin (QU), as an anticancer drug, was loaded on Cu2(BDC)2(DABCO) and Cu2(F4BDC)2)DABCO) MOFs. As these Cu&#8208;MOFs have a high surface area, a suitable pore size, and biocompatible ingredients, they can be utilized to deliver QU. &#160;The loading efficiency of QU in these MOFs was 49.5% and 41.3%, respectively. The drug&#8208;loaded compounds displayed sustained drug release over 15 days, remarkably high drug loading capacities and pH&#8208;controlled release behavior. The prepared nanostructures were characterized by different characterization technics including FT&#8208;IR, PXRD, ZP, TEM, FE&#8208;SEM, UV&#8208;vis, and BET. In addition, MTT assays were carried out on HeLa and HEK&#8208;293 cell lines to investigate cytotoxicity. Cellular apoptosis analysis was performed to investigate the cell death mechanisms. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to analyze the interactions between MOFs and QU. Moreover, the stability of MOFs was also investigated during and after the drug release process. Ultimately, kinetic models of drug release were evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled self&#8208;assembly of Pt(II) complexes is key to the development of optical and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, but designing and precisely controlling them is still difficult owing to weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we report the successful water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced assembly of an anionic Pt(II) complex [Pt(CN)2(ppy)]&#8211; (Hppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine) electrostatically loaded on cationically charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles consisting of Mg2+ and Al3+ ions. When the Pt(II) complexes were densely loaded onto the LDH nanoparticles, the assembly was maintained, even in dilute aqueous media. In the case of sparse loading, the Pt(II) complexes were loaded discretely in the dry state; however, when water vapor was adsorbed, the increased mobility of the Pt(II) complexes led to their assembly on the LDH nanoparticles. This resulted in a drastic change in luminescence from green to orange owing to the presence of water vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium(V) pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff base catecholate complexes are novel lipophilic, redox&#8208;active and selectively cytotoxic in glioblastoma (T98g) cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new series of complexes with pyridine&#8208;containing Schiff bases, [VVO(SALIEP)L] and [VVO(Cl&#8208;SALIEP)L] (SALIEP = N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine; Cl&#8208;SALIEP = N&#8208;(5&#8208;chlorosalicylideneaminato)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethylpyridine, L = catecholato(2&#8208;) ligand) were synthesized. Characterization by 1H and 51V NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies confirmed that: 1) most complexes form two major geometric isomers in solution, and [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] (DTB = di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholato(2&#8208;)) forms two isomers that equilibrate in solution; and 2) tert&#8208;butyl substituents was necessary to stabilize the reduced V(IV) species (EPR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry). The pyridine moiety within the Schiff base ligands significantly changed their chemical properties with unsubstituted catecholate ligands compared with the parent HSHED (N&#8208;(salicylideneaminato)&#8208;N&#714;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) Schiff base complexes. Immediate reduction to V(IV) occurred for the unsubstituted&#8208;catecholato V(V) complexes on dissolution in DMSO. By contrast, the pyridine moiety within the Schiff base significantly improved the hydrolytic stability of [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] compared with [VVO(HSHED)(DTB)]. [VVO(SALIEP)(DTB)] had moderate stability in cell culture media. There was significant cellular uptake of the intact complex by T98g (human glioblastoma) cells and very good anti&#8208;proliferative activity (IC50 6.7 &#177; 0.9 &#956;M, 72 h), which was ~five&#8208;fold higher compared with the non&#8208;cancerous human cell line, HFF&#8208;1 (IC50 34 &#177; 10 &#956;M). This made it a potential drug candidate for the treatment of advanced gliomas by intracranial injections.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we explore a possible platform for the CO2 reduction (CO2R) in one of water&#8217;s solid phases, namely clathrate hydrates (CHs), by ab initio molecular dynamics and well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions. We find that the stacked H2O nanocages in CHs assist to initialize CO2R by increasing the electron&#8208;binding ability of CO2. The substantial CO2R processes are further influenced by the hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) networks in CHs. The first intermediate CO2&#8722; in this process can be stabilized through cage structure reorganization into the H&#8208;bonded [CO2&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;OHcage] complex. Further cooperative structural dynamics enables the complex to convert into a vital transient [CO22&#8722;&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;OHcage] intermediate via a low&#8208;barrier disproportionation&#8208;like process. Such a highly reactive intermediate spontaneously triggers sequent double proton transfer along its tethering H&#8208;bonds, finally converting it into HCOOH. These hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors feature multifunction in facilitating CO2R such as confining, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalyzing and proton pump. Our findings have a general interest and extend the knowledge of CO2R into porous aqueous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Gated Photochromism of Dithienylethene&#8208;embeded Expanded Calixphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;embedded expanded porphyrins were synthesized and confirmed to be photochemically inactive due to the lowest excited state of the expanded porphyrins. On the other hand, DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibited reversible photochromism upon UV&#8208;irradiation to form colored closed forms, which reverted to colorless open forms upon red&#8208;light irradiation. The closed forms were oxidized with DDQ or the air to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins. This was unlocked by reduction with NaBH4 to restore expanded calixphyrins with photochromism activity. These gated photochromic behaviors were demonstrated in PMMA film.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bimetallic &#65279;end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes have served as the platform for photochemical N2 activation, mainly for the N&#8211;N cleavage. However, the alternate N&#8211;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation route has remained largely unexplored. Herein, we strengthen the notion of weakening the N&#8211;N bond through the population of &#960;* orbital upon electronic excitation from the ground to the first excited state using four prototypical complexes based on Fe (1), Mo (2), and Ru (3,4). The complexes 1&#8208;4 possess characteristic N&#8211;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8211;N&#8211;N&#8211;M core, which was earlier postulated to play a central role in the N2 photoactivation. Vertical electronic excitation of the highest oscillator strength involves transitions to the N&#8211;N &#960;*&#8208;based acceptor orbital (&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*&#8211;&#960;*) in complexes 1&#8208;4. This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (1MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8211;N&#8211;N&#8211;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full&#8208;sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8211;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation with &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8211;N bond and bent MNN angle in the photoexcited S1 state of 1&#8208;4 resemble their radical&#8208; and di&#8208;anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8211;N protonation in the S1 excited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Diversified Penta&#8208;Spiro&#8208;Heterocyclic and Fused&#8208;Heterocyclic Frameworks with Potent Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work applied Rh(III)&#8208;catalyst mediated substrate&#8208; and pH&#8208;controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks containing indazolone are structurally unique and represent a class of potentially dominant skeletons. In this work, we successfully fulfilled Rh(III)&#8208;catalyst mediated substrate&#8208; and pH&#8208; controlled strategies to construct four novel types of complicated penta&#8208;spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks via C&#8722;H activation/[4+1] and [4+2] annulation cascades. This method had mild reaction conditions, a broad scope of substrates, moderate to good yields, and valuable applications, which could realize for the first time the generation of the novel di&#8208;spiro&#8208;heterocyclic and multiple fused&#8208;heterocyclic products with unique structures. More importantly, novel spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;indazolo[1,2&#8208;a]indazole] scaffold constructed by this method exhibited potent antitumor activity against a variety of refractory solid tumors and hematological malignancies in&#8197;vitro. Overall, our work provided new insights into the construction of complex and diverse multiple spiro/fused&#8208;heterocyclic systems and offered novel valuable lead compounds for the discovery of antitumor drugs.

Graphdiyne, as a novel type of carbon allostrope, possessing both a planar conjugated structure and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. This review summarized various synthesis and modification methods of the GDY&#8208;based materials and their recent advances in energy storage are reviewed, including applications mainly in Li&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices, and the perspectives of the challenges and opportunities faced by GDY&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Graphynes (GYs) are a novel type of carbon allotrope composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, boasting both a planar conjugated structure akin to graphene and a pore&#8208;like configuration in three&#8208;dimensional space. Graphdiyne (GDY), the first successfully synthesized member of GYs family, has gained much interest due to its fascinating electrochemical properties including a greater theoretical capacity, high charge mobility and advanced electronic transport properties, making it a promising material for energy storage applications for lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage. Various methods, including heteroatom substitution, embedding, strain, and nanomorphology control, have been employed to further enhance the energy storage performance of GDY. Despite the potential of GDY in energy storage applications, there are still challenges to overcome in scaling up mass production. This review summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and application of GDY in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage, highlighting the obstacles faced in large&#8208;scale commercial application of GDY&#8208;based energy storage devices. Suggestions on possible solutions to overcome these hurdles have also been provided. Overall, the unique properties of GDY make it a promising material for energy storage applications in lithium&#8208;ion and hydrogen storage devices. The findings presented here will inspire further development of energy storage devices utilizing GDY.

         <title>Heterobimetallic Hydrides with a Germanium(II)&#8208;Zinc Bond</title>

         <dc:description>
Addition of zinc hydride to the germanium(II) center results in zincagermanes with H&#8722;Zn&#8722;Ge&#8722;H core, which react with CO2 to give a digermylene and zinc formate.







Abstract
In the presence of TMEDA (TMEDA=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine), zinc dihydride reacted with germanium(II) compounds (BDI&#8722;H)Ge (1) and [(BDI)Ge][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (3) (BDI&#8208;H = HC{(C=CH2)(CMe)(NAr)2}, BDI = [HC(CMeNAr)2]; Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) by formal insertion of the germanium(II) center into the Zn&#8722;H bond of polymeric [ZnH2]n to give neutral and cationic zincagermane with a H&#8722;Ge&#8208;Zn&#8722;H core [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (2) and [(BDI)Ge(H)&#8208;(H)Zn(tmeda)][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (4), respectively. Compound 2 eliminated [ZnH2] giving diamido germylene 1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Compound 2 and deuterated analogue 2&#8208;d2 exchanged with [ZnH2]n and [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA to give a mixture of 2 and 2&#8208;d2. Compounds 2 and 4 reacted with carbon dioxide (1&#8197;bar) at room temperature to form zincagermane diformate [(BDI&#8722;H)Ge(OCHO)&#8208;(OCHO)Zn(tmeda)] (5) and formate bridged digermylene [({BDI}Ge)2(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)]+[B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (6) along with zinc formate [(tmeda)Zn(&#956;&#8208;OCHO)3Zn(tmeda)][B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (7), respectively. The hydridic nature of the Ge&#8722;H and Zn&#8722;H bonds in 2 and 4 was probed by reactions with Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acids.

         <title>A Blueprint for the Stabilization of Sub&#8208;Valent Alkaline Earth Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Group 2 metals are classically found in the +2 oxidation state and their sub&#8208;valent chemistry is hugely underdeveloped. Here we present a blueprint for a new approach towards the synthesis and stabilization of heavy Group 2 metals in the +1 oxidation state, based on the use of highly equatorial ligand environments (i.&#8201;e. trigonal planar, square planar). Our computational analysis highlights the potential role played by d&#8208;orbitals to access these species.







Abstract
The study of sub&#8208;valent Group 2 chemistry is a relatively new research field, being established in 2007 with the report of the first Mg(I) dimers. These species are stabilized by the formation of a Mg&#8722;Mg covalent bond; however, the extension of this chemistry to heavier alkaline earth (AE) metals has been frustrated by significant synthetic challenges, primarily associated with the instability of heavy AE&#8722;AE interactions. Here we present a new blueprint for the stabilization of heavy AE(I) complexes, based upon the reduction of AE(II) precursors with planar coordination geometries. We report the synthesis and structural characterisation of homoleptic trigonal planar AE(II) complexes of the monodentate amides {N(SiMe3)2}&#8722; and {N(Mes)(SiMe3)}&#8722;. DFT calculations showed that the LUMOs of these complexes all show some d&#8208;character for AE = Ca&#8722;Ba. DFT analysis of the square planar Sr(II) complex [Sr{N(SiMe3)2}(dioxane)2]&#8734; revealed analogous frontier orbital d&#8208;character. AE(I) complexes that could be accessed by reduction of these AE(II) precursors were modelled computationally, revealing exergonic formation in all cases. Crucially, NBO calculations show that some d&#8208;character is preserved in the SOMO of theoretical AE(I) products upon reduction, showing that d&#8208;orbitals could play a crucial role in achieving stable heavy AE(I) complexes.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Vicinal Tertiary Carbinols: Application in the Synthesis of a Diol Substructure of Zaragozic Acid, Pactamycin and Ryanodol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for the stereoselective synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols has been developed. This strategy featured stereoselective O21 [4+2] cycloaddition of designed cyclohexadienones followed by O&#8722;O and C&#8722;C bond cleavage. A versatile synthetic intermediate was prepared on practical scale as a potential precursor to a wide variety of vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Application of the developed strategy enabled entry to the highly advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.







Abstract
A novel and flexible approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols is reported. The developed strategy featured a highly diastereoselective singlet&#8208;oxygen (O21) [4+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed cyclohexadienones (derived from oxidative dearomatization of the corresponding carboxylic&#8208;acid appended phenol precursors), followed by programmed &#8220;O&#8722;O&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8722;C&#8221; bond cleavage. In doing so, a highly functionalized and versatile intermediate was identified and prepared in synthetically useful quantity as a plausible precursor to access a variety of designed and naturally occurring vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Most notably, the developed strategy was successfully applied in the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.

         <title>Quantifying Catalysis at the Origin of Life
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origin of life theories often invoke catalytic mechanisms, but catalysis of biologically relevant reactions in geologically plausible scenarios has been until recently experimentally elusive. In this perspective, we suggest that researchers move toward decreased catalyst loading, increased yields, as well as before/after characterization of metals or minerals to demonstrate true catalysis.







Abstract
The construction of hypothetical environments to produce organic molecules such as metabolic intermediates or amino acids is the subject of ongoing research into the emergence of life. Experiments specifically focused on an anabolic approach typically rely on a mineral catalyst to facilitate the supply of organics that may have produced prebiotic building blocks for life. Alternatively to a true catalytic system, a mineral could be sacrificially oxidized in the production of organics, necessitating the emergent &#8216;life&#8217; to turn to virgin materials for each iteration of metabolic processes. The aim of this perspective is to view the current &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; literature through the lens of materials chemistry to evaluate the need for higher catalytic activity and materials analyses. While many elegant studies have detailed the production of chemical building blocks under geologically plausible and biologically relevant conditions, few appear to do so with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metals or minerals. Moving toward sub&#8208;stoichiometric metals with rigorous materials analyses is necessary to demonstrate the viability of an elusive cornerstone of the &#8216;metabolism&#8208;first&#8217; hypotheses: catalysis. We emphasize that future work should aim to demonstrate decreased catalyst loading, increased productivity, and/or rigorous materials analyses for evidence of true catalysis.

         <title>A preference for heterolepticity &#8211; Schlenk type equilibria in organometallic beryllium systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of beryllium halides with diphenyl beryllium were investigated in the N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor solvents NEt3 and THF, as well as in benzene and dichloromethane in the presence of the Lewis basic ligands THF, NEt3 and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with various steric demand. In all cases the selective formation of heteroleptic beryllium Grignard compounds of the general formula [(L)1&#8208;2BePhX]1&#8208;2 (X = Cl, Br, I; L = C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;donor ligand) was observed.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reactions of beryllium halides with diphenyl beryllium were investigated in the N- and O-donor solvents NEt3 and THF, as well as in benzene and dichloromethane in the presence of the Lewis basic ligands THF, NEt3 and N-heterocyclic carbenes with various steric demand. In all cases the selective formation of heteroleptic beryllium Grignard compounds of the general formula [(L)1-2BePhX]1-2 (X = Cl, Br, I; L = C-, N-, O-donor ligand) was observed. The stability of these complexes was investigated computationally, while the differences between homo- and heteroleptic systems were also evaluated NMR spectroscopically and with single crystal X-ray diffraction. Mechanistic studies on the formation and speciation of these beryllium Grignard complexes in solution were performed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azoheteroarenes are emerging as powerful alternatives to azobenzene molecular photoswitches. Herein, we introduce water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxale photoswitches. UV/vis and NMR spectroscopy revealed moderate to very good photostationary states and reversible photoisomerization between the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers over multiple cycles with minimal photobleaching. Several arylazoisoxales form host&#8208;guest complexes with &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin with significant differences in binding constants for each photoisomer as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR experiments, indicating their potential for photoresponsive host&#8208;guest chemistry in water. One carboxylic acid functionalized arylazoisoxale can act as a hydrogelator, allowing gel properties to be manipulated reversibly with light. The hydrogel was characterized by rheological experiments, atom force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These results demonstrate that arylazoisoxazoles can find applications as molecular photoswitches in aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Porous organic cages (POCs) are meanwhile an established class of porous materials. Most of them are soluble to a certain extend and thus processable in or from solution. However, a few of larger salicylimine cages were reported to be insoluble in any organic solvents and thus characterized as amorphous materials. These cages were now synthesized as single&#8208;crystalline materials to get insight into packing motifs and preferred intermolecular interactions.

         <dc:description>The carbide ligand in the iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) in nitrogenase bridges iron atoms in different oxidation states, yet it is difficult to discern its ability to mediate magnetic exchange interactions due to the structural complexity of the cofactor. Here, we describe two mixed&#8208;valent diiron complexes with C&#8208;based ketenylidene bridging ligands, and compare the carbon bridges with the more familiar sulfur bridges. The ground state of the [Fe2(m&#8208;CCO)2]+&#160;complex with two carbon bridges (4) is&#160;S&#160;= 1/2 and is valence delocalized on the M&#246;ssbauer timescale with a small thermal barrier for electron hopping that stems from the low Fe&#8211;C force constant. In contrast, one&#8208;electron reduction of the [Fe2(m&#8208;CCO)] complex with one carbon bridge (2) affords a mixed&#8208;valence species with a high&#8208;spin ground state (S&#160;= 7/2), and the Fe&#8211;Fe distance contracts by 1&#160;&#197;. Spectroscopic, magnetic, and computational studies of the latter reveal an Fe&#8211;Fe bonding interaction that leads to complete valence delocalization. Analysis of near&#8208;IR intervalence charge transfer transitions in&#160;5&#160;indicates a very large double exchange constant (B) in the range of 780&#8211;965 cm&#8211;1. These results show that carbon bridges are extremely effective at stabilizing valence delocalized ground states in mixed&#8208;valent iron dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chirality Transfer to the Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide Anion of an Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective chirality transfer from the chiral (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion of an ionic liquid is observed, resulting in optical activity of the achiral anion as detected by calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra.







Abstract
Chirality transfer from the chiral molecule (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the achiral anion of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid is observed. The chiral probe selectively affects one part of the binary ionic liquid, i.&#8201;e., it has previously been shown experimentally and theoretically that this particular imidazolium cation can be affected by chirality transfer, but in the present system chirality is almost exclusively transferred to the anion and not to both parts of the solvent (anion and cation). This observation is of high relevance because of its selectivity and because anion effects are usually much more important in ionic liquid research than cation effects. From ab&#8197;initio molecular dynamics simulations, a conformational analysis and dissected vibrational circular dichroism spectra are obtained to study the chirality transfer. While in the neat ionic liquid two mirror imaged trans conformers of the anion occur almost equally, we observe an excess of one of these conformers in the presence of the chiral solute, causing optical activity of the anion. Although the cis conformers are not tremendously affected by the chirality transfer, they gain in total population when (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide is dissolved in the ionic liquid.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space, Lone&#8208;Pair Promoted Aromatic Substitution: A Relay Mechanism Can Beat Out Direct Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through stabilized &#8220;relay&#8221; tranisition states: Various Lewis basic functional groups can spatially activate aromatic substitutions. Mechanistically, these reactions proceed through an exothermic relay pathway, as opposed to the previously assumed endothermic direct activation. In this article, both experimental and theoretical models are employed to investigate this newly discovered mode of arene activation in detail.







Abstract
We report a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of through&#8208;space arene activation with halogens, tetrazoles and achiral esters and amides. Contrary to previously assumed direct activation through &#963;&#8208;complex stabilization, our results suggest that these reactions proceed by a relay mechanism wherein the lone pair&#8208;containing activators form exothermic &#960;&#8208;complexes with electrophilic nitronium ion before transferring it to the probe ring through low barrier transition states. Noncovalent interactions (NCI) plots and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analyses depict favorable interactions between the Lewis base (LB) and the nitronium ion in the precomplexes and the transition states, suggesting directing group participation throughout the mechanism. The regioselectivity of substitution also comports with a relay mechanism. In all, these data pave the way for an alternate platform of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.

         <title>Cation Adaptive Structures Based on Manganese Cyanide Prussian Blue Analogues: Application of Powder Diffraction Data to Solve Complex, Unprecedented Stoichiometries and&#160;Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mn(II) salt and A+CN&#8208; under anaerobic conditions react to form extended structured compounds of AmMnIIn(CN)m+2n&#160;stoichiometry, e.g. AMnII3(CN)7, A2MnII3(CN)8, A2MnII5(CN)12, A3MnII5(CN)13, and A2MnII[MnII(CN)6]&#160;(A represents alkali and tetraalkylammonium cations).&#160;Cs2MnII[MnII(CN)6] has the typical Prussian blue face centered cubic unit cell. However, the other alkali salts are monoclinic or rhombohedral. This is in accord with smaller alkali cation radii creating void space that is minimized by increasing the van der Waals stabilization energy by reducing &#8736;Mn&#8211;N&#8801;C. This is attributed to the non&#8208;rigidity of the framework structure due the significant ionic character associated with the high&#8208;spin MnII sites. For larger tetraalkylammonium cations, the high&#8208;spin Mn sites lack sufficient electrostatic A+&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;NC stabilization and only form unexpected 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinated Mn sites within a flexible, extended framework around the cation; hence, the size, shape, and charge of the cation dictate the unprecedented stoichiometry and unpredictable cation adaptive structures. Antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent MnII sites leads to ferrimagnetic ordering, but in some cases antiferromagnetic coupling of ferrimagnetic layers are compensated and synthetic&#160;antiferromagnets are observed. The magnetic ordering temperatures for ferrimagnetic A2MnII[MnII(CN)6] with both octahedral high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin MnII sites increase with decreasing &#8736;Mn&#8211;N&#8801;C. The&#160;extended structured materials were obtained by powder diffraction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step multicomponent reaction has been achieved for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines by using different aliphatic amines, propionates as starting material and CF3SO2Na. In this protocol, various aliphatic amines including primary amines, cyclic or acyclic secondary amines were demonstrated to be good coupling partners, and different &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines were obtained in moderate to good yields. Among them, the primary aliphatic amines only gave pure (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines as products. The synthetic utility of the MCRs strategy was further demonstrated by mild conditions, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and natural sunlight&#8208;induced protocol.

         <title>Behavior of a Dynamic Covalent Library Driven by Combined Pd(II) and Biphasic Effectors for Metal Transport between Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the effect of Pd(II) as chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in biphasic systems (water/chloroform). The constituents of the DCL are self&#8208;built and distributed in the two phases, two of them are lipophilic enough to play the role of a carrier agent that may transfer Pd(II) from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Upon the addition of Pd(II), the DCL of components exhibits a strong amplification of the constituent that is the most adapted to stabilize Pd(II) in chloroform as well as its agonist in water. We demonstrated that this evolution is driven by the combination of the interaction of the DCL with Pd(II) and the presence of the two phases. This study paves the way to a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by means of adaptive extractant species generated in situ by a DCL.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Covalent Organic Framework with In&#8208;situ Formed Pd Nanoparticles for Efficient Electrochemical&#160;Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;platinum noble metals are highly desirable for the development of highly active, stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, how to improve the utilization of non&#8208;platinum noble metals is an urgent issue. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst for ORR was prepared through homogeneous loading of Pd precursors by a domain&#8208;limited method in a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) followed by pyrolysis. The morphology of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was well maintained after carbonization, which was attributed to the rigid structure of the 3D COF. Thanks to the uniform distribution of Pd NPs in the carbon, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906 V and a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec&#8208;1 in 0.1 M KOH, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.863 V and 75 mV dec&#8208;1). Furthermore, a maximum power density of 144.0 mW cm&#8722;2 was achieved at 252 mA cm&#8722;2, which was significantly higher than the control battery (105.1 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only provides a simple strategy for in&#8208;situ preparation of highly dispersible metal catalysts in COFs, but also offers new insights into the ORR electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Fast Circularly Polarized Luminescence in 2&#8208;Coordinate Chiral Mechanochromic Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral and mechanochromic copper(I) TADF emitters with high radiative rate constants have been examined with regard to their chiroptical properties. Only the structurally flexible phenoxazine ligand generates circular polarized luminescence (CPL) in PMMA matrix presumably due to distortions in the ground and excited states, providing a design strategy for future CPL molecules.







Abstract
A series of chiral mechanochromic copper(I) cAAC (cAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes with a variety of amide ligands have been studied with regard to their photophysical and chiroptical properties to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships for the design of efficient triplet exciton emitters exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Depending on the environment, which determines the excited state energies, either thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from 1/3LLCT states or phosphorescence from 3LLCT/LC states occurs. However, neither chiral moieties at the carbene nor at the carbazolate ligands provide detectable luminescence dissymmetries glum. An exception is [Cu(phenoxazinyl)(cAAC)], showing orange to deep red TADF with &#955;max=601&#8211;715&#8197;nm in solution, powders and in PMMA. In this case, the amide ligand can undergo distortions in the excited state. This design motif leads to the first linear, non&#8208;aggregated CPL&#8208;active copper(I) complex with glum of &#8722;3.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3 combined with a high radiative rate constant of 6.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;105&#8197;s&#8722;1.

Depending on the environment, which determines the excited state energies, either thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from &lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT states or phosphorescence from &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;LLCT/LC states occurs. However, neither chiral moieties at the carbene nor at the carbazolate ligands provide detectable luminescence dissymmetries &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;. An exception is [Cu(phenoxazinyl)(cAAC)], showing orange to deep red TADF with &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=601&#8211;715&#8197;nm in solution, powders and in PMMA. In this case, the amide ligand can undergo distortions in the excited state. This design motif leads to the first linear, non-aggregated CPL-active copper(I) complex with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8722;3.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; combined with a high radiative rate constant of 6.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alkylcyanoborate Anions: Building Blocks for Fluorine&#8208;Free Low&#8208;Viscosity, Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylcyanoborate anions were found to be building blocks for fluorine&#8208;free ionic liquids with appealing properties with respect to potential applications in materials science especially for electrolyte chemistry. The influence of different types and number of alkyl chains on the IL properties has been elucidated.







Abstract
A set of mixed&#8208;substituted potassium alkylcyano&#8208; and alkylcyanofluoroborates has been synthesized using easily accessible starting compounds and characterized by elemental analysis, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. In addition, single&#8208;crystal structures of salts of the cyanoborate anions have been derived from X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids ([EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs) with the new borate anions have been synthesized and their physicochemical properties, that is, high thermal and electrochemical stability, low viscosity, and high conductivity, have been compared to the properties of related [EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs. The influence of the different alkyl substituents at boron has been assessed. The exemplary study on the properties with the [EMIm]+&#8208;ILs with the mixed water stable alkylcyanoborate anions points towards the potential of these fluorine&#8208;free borate anions, in general.

         <title>Covalently Modified Kevlar Fabric Incorporating Graphene Oxide with Enhanced Antibacterial Properties and Preserved Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward covalent post&#8208;functionalization of Kevlar fabric incorporating GO nanosheets significantly enhances the antibacterial properties and preserves their strength.







Abstract
This work describes a multi&#8208;step modification process for the covalent transformation of Kevlar fabric en route to the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Spectroscopic, thermal and microscopy imaging techniques have been employed to follow step&#8208;by&#8208;step the modification of Kevlar and the formation of the corresponding Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric. The level of Kevlar's functionalization can be controlled with the nitration time, the first reaction in the multi&#8208;sequence organic transformations, for obtaining the hybrid fabric with a content of GO up to 30&#8201;%. Most importantly, the covalent post&#8208;modification of Kevlar does not occur in the expense of the other excellent mechanical properties of the fabric. Under optimal conditions, the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric shows a 20&#8201;% enhancement of the ultimate strength. Notably, when the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric was exposed to cyanobacterial Synechococcus the bacteria growth was fully inhibited. Overall, the covalently modified fabric demonstrated significant antibacterial behavior, excellent strength and stability under common processes. Due to its simplicity, the methodology presented in this work not only promises to result in a standard procedure to functionalize the mer units of Kevlar with a variety of chemicals and nanomaterials but it can be also extended for the modification and hybridization of other fabrics.
