         <title>Selective, Transition Metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;Diboration of Alkyl Halides, Tosylates, and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of readily available secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols was developed. The use of KI and DMA is critical to the methodology, which circumvents the regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity problems. The transformation showed a broad substrate scope (75 examples), and practicality for the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products.







Abstract
Defunctionalization of readily available feedstocks to provide alkenes for the synthesis of multifunctional molecules represents an extremely useful process in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols. Control experiments demonstrated that the key to this high reactivity and selectivity is the addition of a combination of potassium iodide and N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA). The practicality and industrial potential of this transformation are demonstrated by its operational simplicity, wide functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules. From a drug discovery perspective, this synthetic method offers control of the position of diversification and diastereoselectivity in complex ring scaffolds, which would be especially useful in a lead optimization program.

         <title>Distinct Bimetallic Cooperativity Among Water Reduction Catalysts Containing [CoIIICoIII], [NiIINiII], and [ZnIIZnII] Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear species containing [Co2], [Ni2], and [Zn2] cores had their catalytic water reduction activity studied aiming to establish possible cooperative effects among neighboring metal centers. The [Co2] and [Ni2] species effectively produce H2 via substantially different mechanisms. Structural cooperativity is observed for the former, while no obvious cooperativity is seen for the latter. The [Zn2] species is expectedly not catalytic and serves to establish the need of redox metals to attain catalysis







Abstract
Three binuclear species [LCoIII2(&#956;&#8208;Pz)2](ClO4)3 (1), [LNiII2(CH3OH)2Cl2]ClO4 (2), and [LZnII2Cl2]PF6 (3) supported by the deprotonated form of the ligand 2,6&#8208;bis[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl) amino&#8208;methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol were synthesized, structurally characterized as solids and in solution, and had their electrochemical and spectroscopic behavior established. Species 1&#8211;3 had their water reduction ability studied aiming to interrogate the possible cooperative catalytic activity between two neighboring metal centers. Species 1 and 2 reduced H2O to H2 effectively at an applied potential of &#8722;1.6&#8197;VAg/AgCl, yielding turnover numbers of 2,820 and 2,290, respectively, after 30&#8197;minutes. Species 3 lacked activity and was used as a negative control to eliminate the possibility of ligand&#8208;based catalysis. Pre&#8208; and post&#8208;catalytic data gave evidence of the molecular nature of the process within the timeframe of the experiments. Species 1 showed structural, rather than electronic cooperativity, while species 2 displayed no obvious cooperativity. DFT methods complemented the experimental results determining plausible mechanisms.

         <title>An Unprecedented FeMo6@Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66 Nanocomposite with Cascade Enzyme&#8208;Mimic Activity as Colorimetric Sensing Platform</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel integrated nanozymes (INAzymes), FeMo6@Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66 (FC&#8208;66(n)), are designed and synthesized by encapsulating iron&#8208;based polyoxometalates into the ceria&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework. Due to the oxygen&#8208;driven reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ couple sites, the &#8220;Fenton&#8208;like&#8221; effect by iron centers, the &#8220;nanoscale proximity&#8221; effects by nanocages and their synergistic effects, FC&#8208;66(n) as INAzymes exhibit elegant cascade enzyme&#8208;mimic activities. Based on the excellent catalytic activity of the FC&#8208;66(n), an efficient fluorescent &#8220;turning&#8208;on&#8208;enhanced&#8221; platform for dopamine (DA) detection under near neutral conditions was established.







Abstract
Introducing the idea of integrated design and cascade activity into nanozyme, the novel integrated nanozymes (INAzymes), FeMo6@Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66 (FC&#8208;66(n)), were designed and synthesized by encapsulating iron&#8208;based polyoxometalates (FeMo6) into the ceria&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66). Due to the oxygen&#8208;driven reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ couple sites, the &#8220;Fenton&#8208;like&#8221; effect by iron centers, the &#8220;nanoscale proximity&#8221; effects by nanocages, and their synergistic effects, FC&#8208;66(n) as INAzymes exhibit elegant cascade enzyme&#8208;mimic activities (oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and Fenton&#8208;like activity), which realizes INAzyme activities based on polyoxometalates based metal&#8211;organic framework (POMOFs). By employing dopamine (DA) detection as a model reaction, a high&#8208;efficient fluorescent &#8220;turning&#8208;on&#8208;enhanced&#8221; platform under near neutral conditions was established.

         <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Perylene Monoimides as Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells: A Study on the Structure&#8211;Property Relationship</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out with the old, in with the new: Perylene monoimide has long been in the shadow of its famous sibling: perylene diimide. And this, despite its talents! In this study, perylene monoimide takes the spotlight and it has things to tell.







Abstract
A series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors based on perylene monoimides coupled in the peri position through phenylene linkers were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;coupling reactions. Various substitution patterns were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experimental data to elucidate the geometry and their optical and electrochemical properties. Further investigations of the bulk properties with grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) gave insight into the stacking behavior of the acceptor thin films. Electrochemical and morphological properties correlate with the photovoltaic performance of devices with the polymeric donor PBDB&#8208;T and a maximum efficiency of 3.17&#8201;% was reached. The study gives detailed information about structure&#8211;property relationships of perylene&#8208;linker&#8208;perylene compounds.

         <title>Dye Sensitization Offers a Brighter Afterglow Nanoparticle Future for in&#8197;vivo Recharged Luminescent Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept paper reviews the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as existing challenges and proposes future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized afterglow nanoparticles.







Abstract
While concerns about improving recharged afterglow intensity in&#8197;vivo still motivate further exploration, afterglow nanoparticles (AGNP) offer unique optical merit for autofluorescence&#8208;free biological imaging. Apart from efforts enhancing the afterglow emission properties of AGNP, improving afterglow excitation response to visible or near infrared light is important but has lacked success. Dye sensitization has been used to improve the optical response of photovoltaic nanomaterials and to enhance upconversion luminescence efficiency. This concept has recently been expanded and applied to AGNPs. As a new multifunctional nanoprobe, such dye&#8208;sensitized AGNP takes advantage of both high spatial resolution fluorescence imaging and sensitive afterglow imaging. This Concept introduces the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as reviewing existing challenges and proposing future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized AGNPs.

         <title>A New Class of Task&#8208;Specific Imidazolium Salts and Ionic Liquids and Their Corresponding Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes for Immobilization on Electrochemically Active Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Task&#8208;specific polyaryl&#8208;/oligoether&#8208;substituted, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with linker moieties enable interaction with electrochemically active surfaces. Thus, electron and proton transfer ought to be facilitated along the side chains. When used as a precursor for carbene ligands, the complex's reactivity and potential catalytic activity can be increased by interaction with an electrode. The ether functionality also enhances the catalyst's solubility, for example, in oligoether&#8208;based ILs. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Meyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200100).

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Diruthenium Complexes with &#960;&#8208;Extended Alkenyl Ligands and Their F4TCNQ Charge&#8208;Transfer Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of charge&#8208;transfer salts from diruthenium complexes with two differently extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligands and the strong electron&#8208;acceptor F4TCNQ is presented. These salts have been characterized by EPR, UV/Vis/NIR (in solution and solid states) and IR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The synthesis of dinuclear ruthenium alkenyl complexes with {Ru(CO)(PiPr3)2(L)} entities (L=Cl&#8722; in complexes Ru2&#8208;3 and Ru2&#8208;7; L=acetylacetonate (acac&#8722;) in complexes Ru2&#8208;4 and Ru2&#8208;8) and with &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2,7&#8208;divinylphenanthrenediyl (Ru2&#8208;3, Ru2&#8208;4) or 5,8&#8208;divinylquinoxalinediyl (Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8) as bridging ligands are reported. The bridging ligands are laterally &#960;&#8208;extended by anellating a pyrene (Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8) or a 6,7&#8208;benzoquinoxaline (Ru2&#8208;3, Ru2&#8208;4) &#960;&#8208;perimeter. This was done with the hope that the open &#960;&#8208;faces of the electron&#8208;rich complexes will foster association with planar electron acceptors via &#960;&#8208;stacking. The dinuclear complexes were subjected to cyclic and square&#8208;wave voltammetry and were characterized in all accessible redox states by IR, UV/Vis/NIR and, where applicable, by EPR spectroscopy. These studies signified the one&#8208;electron oxidized forms of divinylphenylene&#8208;bridged complexes Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8 as intrinsically delocalized mixed&#8208;valent species, and those of complexes Ru2&#8208;3 and Ru2&#8208;4 with the longer divinylphenanthrenediyl linker as partially localized on the IR, yet delocalized on the EPR timescale. The more electron&#8208;rich acac&#8722; congeners formed non&#8208;conductive 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 charge&#8208;transfer (CT) salts on treatment with the F4TCNQ electron acceptor. All spectroscopic techniques confirmed the presence of pairs of complex radical cations and F4TCNQ.&#8722; radical anions in these CT salts, but produced no firm evidence for the relevance of &#960;&#8208;stacking to their formation and properties.

         <title>Hole/Electron Transporting Materials for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review discusses the latest progress with interlayers used in non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells, in which the electron transporting layers are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, nonconjugated and conjugated electrolytes and the electron transporting layers are summarized categories of organic and inorganic ones.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptor based organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs) have witnessed rapid progress over the past few years owing to the intensive research efforts on novel electron donor and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, interfacial engineering, and device processing techniques. Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extraction from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the lates progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF&#8208;OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non&#8208;conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. In addition, some bifunctional interlayer materials served as both ETLs and HTLs are also introduced. Finally, the prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF&#8208;OSCs are provided.

Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extraction from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the lates progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF-OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non-conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. In addition, some bifunctional interlayer materials served as both ETLs and HTLs are also introduced. Finally, the prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF-OSCs are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) derived from ynamides and bearing diverse fluorene&#8208;based chromophores or other tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were prepared. The conceived sulfonamido&#8208;TCBDs showed remarkable photophysical properties covering a large range of wavelengths from the visible region to the NIR. They displayed an environment&#8208;sensitive emission that was observed in nonpolar solvents and in the solid state but was very weak in dichloromethane. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached values up to 7.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) bearing a large diversity of fluorophores were prepared following a multi&#8208;step synthesis. In a crucial last step, all compounds were obtained from the corresponding ynamides, which were particularly suitable for the formation of the TCBDs in the presence of tetracyanoethylene via a [2+2] cycloaddition/retroelectrocyclization step (CA&#8208;RE). Several fluorenyl derivatives in addition to phenanthrenyl and terphenyl ones provided ynamide&#8208;based TCBDs affording remarkable emission properties covering a large range of wavelengths. Those compounds emit both in solid state and in solution from the visible region to the NIR range, depending on the molecular structures. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached unforeseen values for such derivatives, up to 7.8&#8201;%. A huge sensitivity to the environment of the TCBDs has also been unraveled for most of the compounds since we observed a dramatic fall of the quantum yields when changing the solvent from cyclohexane to toluene, while they are almost non&#8208;emissive in dichloromethane.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid State and Solution Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chalcogen bonding (ChB) ability of Te is studied in symmetrical diaryl ditellurides ArTeTeAr. Among the two Te &#963;&#8208;holes, the one along the less polarized Te&#8208;Te bond was calculated as the more electropositive. This counter&#8208;intuitive situation is due to the hyperconjugation contribution from Te lone pair to the &#963;* of the adjacent Te which coincides with &#963;&#8208;hole along the more polarized Te&#8208;Ar bond. ArTeTeAr showed notable structural features in the solid state as a result of intermolecular Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Te ChB, such as a Te  4  rectangle through dimer aggregation or a triangular Te  3  motif, where one Te interacts with both Te atoms of a neighboring molecule through both its &#963;&#8208;hole and lone pair, in a slightly frustrated geometry. Lewis acidity of ArTeTeAr was also evaluated by NMR with R  3  PO as &#963;&#8208;hole acceptors in different solvents. Thus,  125  Te NMR allowed monitoring Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and delivering association constants (  K  a  ) for 1:1 adducts. The highest value of  K  a  = 90 M  &#8208;1  was measured for the adduct between ArTeTeAr bearing CF  3  groups and Et  3  PO in cyclohexane. Notably, by using  n  Bu  3  PO, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction was revealed by  19  F&#8208;  1  H HOESY showing spatial proximity between CF  3  and CH  3  of  n  Bu  3  PO.</dc:description>

A regioselective [3+3] annulation of alkynyl ketimines with &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones for the synthesis of polysubstituted 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives with a quaternary CF3&#8208;containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst, providing the desired products in up to 99&#8201;% yield. The method tolerates some variations in the &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones scope. The products could be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale and several products were conveniently transformed.







Abstract
Regioselective [3+3] annulation of alkynyl ketimines with &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones for the synthesis of polysubstituted 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives with a quaternary CF3&#8208;containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)2 as the catalyst. The novel strategy tolerates a wide range of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones with both aryl and alkyl substitutents. A preliminary asymmetric synthesis of chiral product 3 has been attempted by using copper and chiral thiourea as the cocatalyst with excellent yields (86&#8208;99&#8201;%) and good enantioselectivities (71&#8211;78&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, product 3&#8201;aa could be obtained on a gram&#8208;scale reaction with 75&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization. Several products were also transformed readily. Control experiments indicate that the reaction involves a process with a base&#8208;catalyzed or chiral thiourea&#8208;catalyzed Mannich&#8208;type reaction followed by a highly regioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing reaction on the alkynyl moiety in a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig fashion.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis for a Wide Variety of Patellamide Derivatives and Phosphatase Activity of Copper&#8208;Patellamide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic procedure for natural and artificial patellamides, found in the ascidians of the Great Barrier Reef, is presented. These macrocycles are known to tightly bind CuII, and the variety of easily available patellamide derivatives allows to carefully study the reactivity as a function of the structure of the macrocycle. This has been done by experiment and DFT for phosphatase activity as a possible reaction of metabolic relevance.







Abstract
Copper complexes of patellamides have shown catalytic activity in a variety of reactions but their biological function remains unknown. There are significant differences between the natural macrocycles and synthetic analogues in the various catalytic activities. It therefore is essential to be able to perform in&#8197;vivo and ex vivo reference measurements with the natural patellamide macrocycles, very similar derivatives and a large range of synthetic analogues. The preparative method described allows for a highly adaptable synthetic process producing building blocks for a large range of patellamide derivatives: apart from natural compounds, a new synthetic patellamide was prepared that does not have any substituents at any of the four heterocycles. Together with the variation of substituents at the aliphatic backbone, this allowed to elucidate the catalytic activity for phosphoester hydrolysis as a function of the structure and dynamics of the dicopper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes, both by experiment and DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution at Visible Light Wavelengths by Using a Photocathode with Modal Strong Coupling between Plasmons and a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles, p&#8208;type nickel oxide, and a platinum film under modal strong coupling condition was fabricated. The photocathode absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling. The modal strong coupling boosted hydrogen evolution through the reduction of water by hot&#8208;electron, which involves hot hole&#8208;injection from gold to nickel oxide.







Abstract
Hot&#8208;hole injection from plasmonic metal nanoparticles to the valence band of p&#8208;type semiconductors and reduction by hot electrons should be improved for efficient and tuneable reduction to obtain beneficial chemical compounds. We employed the concept of modal strong coupling between plasmons and a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) nanocavity to enhance the hot&#8208;hole injection efficiency. We fabricated a photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8722;NPs), p&#8208;type nickel oxide (NiO), and a platinum film (Pt film) (ANP). The ANP structure absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling between the plasmons of Au&#8722;NPs and the FP nanocavity of NiO on a Pt film. All wavelength regions of the hybrid modes of the modal strong coupling system promoted hot&#8208;hole injection from the Au&#8722;NPs to NiO and proton/water reduction by hot electrons. The incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency based on H2 evolution through water/proton reduction by hot electrons reached 0.2&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm and 0.04&#8201;% at 800&#8197;nm.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Di&#8208;Pyridyl&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of iodides and bromides of Al, Ga and In with dipyridyl ligands under various conditions lead to a large number of products including cationic two&#8208;dimensional MOFs that exhibit interpenetration and polycatenation. Charge compensation is achieved via tetra&#8208;halido&#8208;metal anions and iodide anions. The latter allows for chemisorption of I2 under formation of I3&#8722; suitable for the capture of radioisotopes of iodine.







Abstract
Eight cationic, two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized in reactions of the group 13 metal halides AlBr3, AlI3, GaBr3, InBr3 and InI3 with the dipyridyl ligands 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpe), 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpa) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy). Seven of them follow the general formula 2&#8734;[MX2(L)2]A, M=Al, In, X=Br, I, A&#8722;=[MX4]&#8722;, I&#8722;, I3&#8722;, L=bipy, bpa, bpe. Thereby, the porosity of the cationic frameworks can be utilized to take up the heavy molecule iodine in gas&#8208;phase chemisorption vital for the capture of iodine radioisotopes. This is achieved by switching between I&#8722; and the polyiodide I3&#8722; in the cavities at room temperature, including single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. The MOFs are 2D networks that exhibit (4,4)&#8208;topology in general or (6,3)&#8208;topology for 2&#8734;[(GaBr2)2(bpa)5][GaBr4]2&#8901;bpa. The two&#8208;dimensional networks can either be arranged to an inclined interpenetration of the cationic two&#8208;dimensional networks, or to stacked networks without interpenetration. Interpenetration is accompanied by polycatenation. Due to the cationic character, the MOFs require the counter ions [MX4]&#8722;, I&#8722; or I3&#8722; counter ions in their pores. Whereas the [MX4]&#8722;, ions are immobile, iodide allows for chemisorption. Furthermore, eight additional coordination polymers and complexes were identified and isolated that elaborate the reaction space of the herein reported syntheses.

         <title>Investigation of Molecular Iridium Fluorides IrFn (n=1&#8211;6): A Combined Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IR spectra of molecular iridium fluorides IrFn (n=1&#8211;6) isolated in solid noble gas matrices are presented. Efficient formation of IrF5 together with minor IrF3 was achieved by irradiation of IrF6 with UV light, while subsequent irradiation leads to almost quantitative formation of IrF4. The presence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects leading to a triplet ground state with C4v symmetry of IrF5 was confirmed spectroscopically under cryogenic conditions.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;initiated defluorination of iridium hexafluoride (IrF6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices at 6&#8197;K, and their photoproducts are characterized by IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The primary photoproducts obtained after irradiation with &#955;=365&#8197;nm are iridium pentafluoride (IrF5) and iridium trifluoride (IrF3), while longer irradiation of the same matrix with &#955;=278&#8197;nm produced iridium tetrafluoride (IrF4) and iridium difluoride (IrF2) by Ir&#8722;F bond cleavage or F2 elimination. In addition, IrF5 can be reversed to IrF6 by adding a F atom when exposed to blue&#8208;light (&#955;=470&#8197;nm) irradiation. Laser irradiation (&#955;=266&#8197;nm) of IrF4 also generated IrF6, IrF5, IrF3 and IrF2. Alternatively, molecular binary iridium fluorides IrFn (n=1&#8211;6) were produced by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated iridium atoms with elemental fluorine in excess neon and argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. Computational studies up to scalar relativistic CCSD(T)/triple&#8208;&#950; level and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computations including spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects supported the formation of these products and provided detailed insights into their molecular structures by their characteristic Ir&#8722;F stretching bands. Compared to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, the influence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling dominates in IrF5, leading to a triplet ground state with C4v symmetry, which was spectroscopically detected in solid argon and neon matrices.

         <title>Decoration Strategy in Para Boron Position: An Effective Way to Achieve Ideal Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable narrowband emitters: In the &#8220;decoration strategy in para B position&#8221;, introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission without undesirable spectral broadening, proving a reasonable molecular design approach for color&#8208;tunable, quenching&#8208;resistant, narrowband and stable multi&#8208;resonance emitters.







Abstract
Narrowband, full&#8208;color, and quenching&#8208;resistant emitters are urgently needed for the next generation high&#8208;resolution displays. Though the flourishment of narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters in blue region, these materials still face thorny challenges such as effective light&#8208;color regulation strategies and concentration&#8208;induced spectral broadening/emission quenching. Herein, the research status of an effective &#8220;decoration strategy for para B position&#8221; is highlighted. On one hand, the introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission, respectively, without undesirable FWHM broadening. On the other hand, a more advanced molecular motif is further proposed through adopting a peripheral benzene ring on the para position of the B&#8208;substituted phenyl in MR core to construct the high&#8208;purity, high&#8208;efficiency, quenching&#8208;resistant and stable MR emitters.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tunable narrowband emitters&lt;/b&gt;: In the &#8220;decoration strategy in para B position&#8221;, introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic- or bathochromic-shift emission without undesirable spectral broadening, proving a reasonable molecular design approach for color-tunable, quenching-resistant, narrowband and stable multi-resonance emitters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrowband, full-color, and quenching-resistant emitters are urgently needed for the next generation high-resolution displays. Though the flourishment of narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters in blue region, these materials still face thorny challenges such as effective light-color regulation strategies and concentration-induced spectral broadening/emission quenching. Herein, the research status of an effective &#8220;decoration strategy for para B position&#8221; is highlighted. On one hand, the introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic- or bathochromic-shift emission, respectively, without undesirable FWHM broadening. On the other hand, a more advanced molecular motif is further proposed through adopting a peripheral benzene ring on the para position of the B-substituted phenyl in MR core to construct the high-purity, high-efficiency, quenching-resistant and stable MR emitters. Such concept is expected to provide a possible way for the modification, optimization and expansion of MR emitters to meet more possible applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Exploration of Furoindolizine&#8208;based Molecular Framework towards a Versatile Fluorescent Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photophysical behaviors of fluorescent molecules largely determine their major utility in biological studies. Despite their well&#8208;defined characteristics, classical fluorophores have often been challenged by their limited synthetic methodology and tunability in adjusting intrinsic optical properties. A novel heterocyclic core equipped with modular functional groups may offer the flexibility to control its photophysical properties with a minimum synthetic effort. By conducting a systematic analysis guided by quantum calculations, we proposed the furoindolizine&#8208;based molecular framework as a unique fluorescent platform capable of providing versatile photophysical properties with minimal structural modification. Furoindolizine derivatives exhibited broadly tunable photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge transfer characteristics using synergistic interaction between two functional moieties. Furthermore, this modular platform enabled us to secure live&#8208;cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide&#183;&#183;&#183;alkyne interaction: A crucial attractive force for their preorganization for topochemical cycloaddition reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report&#160;a new class of attractive intermolecular interaction between azide and ethynyl structural entities in a wide range of molecular crystals. We systematically evaluated this interaction using eleven geometrically different structural motifs which are preorganized to direct solid&#8208;state topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. Supramolecular features of azide and alkyne interaction have been mapped through various crystallographic and quantum chemical approaches. The topological analysis shows that the azide&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;alkyne interactions are manifested with the noticeable participation of electron densities. Interestingly, the reorientation of atomic polarizabilities in vicinal azide and alkyne groups upon interaction in crystals favors the soft orbital&#8208;guided TAAC reactions. Moreover, various solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase energy decomposition methods of individual azide&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;alkyne interactions summa&#8208;rize that the strength (varies from &#8208;5.7 to &#8208;30.1 kJ/mol) is primarily guided by the dispersion forces with influencing contribution from the electrostatics.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules which showed remarkable aggregation induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by the pH and temperature dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyl group migration in pyranosides as studied by experimental and computational methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl group migration affects the synthesis, isolation, manipulation and purification of all acylated organic compounds containing free hydroxyl groups, in particular carbohydrates. While several isolated studies on the migration phenomenon in different buffers have been reported, comprehensive insights into the overall migration process in different monosaccharides under similar conditions have been lacking. Here, we have studied the acyl migration in different monosaccharides using five different acyl groups by a combination of experimental, kinetic and theoretical tools. The results show that the anomeric configuration in the monosaccharide has a major influence on the migration rate, together with the relative configurations of the other hydroxyl groups and the nature of the migrating acyl group. Full mechanistic model, based on computations, demonstrates that the acyl migration proceeds through an anionic stepwise mechanism with linear dependence on the [OH&#8208;] and the pKa of the hydroxyl group toward which the acyl group is migrating.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) macrocyclic dyads con&#173;sisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothio&#173;phene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle. Investigation of the excited state dynamics revealed an oligothiophene bridge size&#8208;dependent fast charge transfer process for the macrocyclic dyads upon PBI subunit excitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para  &#8208;quinone methides ( p  &#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B 2  pin 2  ) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3v  was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is a very important fundamental transformation for conversion of C&#8208;F bond into C&#8208;H bond in organic synthesis. In the past decade, much progress has been achieved with HDF through the utility of low&#8208;valent metals, transition metal complexes and main&#8208;group Lewis acids. Recently, novel methods have been introduced for this purpose via photo&#8208; and electrochemical pathways, which would be of great significance, due to considerable environmental and economic advantages.

         <title>Luminescent Surface&#8208;Tethered Polymer Brush Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;tethered polymers are unique molecular architectures that have been recently used in advanced sensors, electronics, and biomedical applications. However, techniques for characterizing these materials in their surface&#8208;tethered form remain limited. The incorporation of luminescent functionality into these materials has enabled new characterization methods, while also unlocking new applications in optoelectronics, stenography and sensing. Micron&#8208;scale photolithography techniques have recently enabled the preparation of high&#8208;resolution patterns, as well as architectures with unique photophysical properties. Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface tethered polymers, as well as the short&#8208;term challenges and opportunities in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chromans through Bifunctional Enamine&#8208;Metal Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. A concise synthetic method for asymmetric synthesis of chromans from cyclohexanones and salicylaldehydes has been developed to afford tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers in good yields (up to 87%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 11:1:1 dr). This difficult organic transformation was achieved through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. It is believed that the strong activation of the salicylaldehydes through chelating to the metal Lewis acid and the bifunctional nature of the catalyst accounts for the high yields and enantioselectivity of the reaction. The absolute configurations of the chroman products were established through X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT Calculations were conducted to understand the mechanism and stereoselectivity of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Electrochemical Capacitors with Carbon Related Materials as Electrodes for AC Line Filtering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), are getting more essential for the rapid development of electronic devices. In order to satisfy the requirements of ECs with fast rate capability, appreciable capacitance density, numerous efforts have been made towards the preparation and design of electrode materials, which is a decisive factor in the performance of ECs. Carbon related electrode materials have been widely demonstrated to significantly increase the performance of ECs because of its light weight, high strength and high processability. In this concept, the latest advances in the rational design and controllable fabrication of carbon related electrode materials including planar two&#8208;dimensional materials, random three&#8208;dimensional materials, and vertical carbon materials are summarized. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress on carbon&#8208;based ECs have been discussed from the viewpoint of structure of electrode and performance of ECs. Finally, this concept present integrated perspectives on further design and preparation of carbon related ECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Interstitial Hydrides in Nanoclusters can Reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and Form Stable Superatoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept proposes that interstitial hydrides in high&#8208;nuclearity coinage metal nanoclusters can reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and form stable superatoms. This implies the hydride species can induce internal self&#8208;redox reactions (no external reducing agent needed) but as prerequisite the transformed clusters seem to have a similar core framework structure. These observations have implications in catalytic and energy cycles.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity clusters resemble the closest model between the determination of atomically precise chemical species and the bulk metallic version thereof, and both impacts on a variety of applications, including catalysis, optics, sensors, and new energy sources. Our interest lies with the nanoclusters of the Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) metals stabilized by dichalcogenido and hydrido ligands. Herein, we describe superatoms formed by the clusters and their relationship with precursor hydrido clusters. Specifically, our concept seeks to demonstrate a possible correlation that exist between hydrido clusters (and nanoalloys) and the formation of superatoms, with the loss of hydrides and typically with release of H2 gas. These reactions appear to be internal self&#8208;redox reactions and require no additional reducing agent, but does seem to require a similar core structure. Knowledge of such processes could provide insight into how clusters grow and an understanding in bridging the atomically precise cluster &#8211; metal nanoparticle mechanism.

     alt="Interstitial Hydrides in Nanoclusters can Reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and Form Stable Superatoms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The concept proposes&lt;/b&gt; that interstitial hydrides in high-nuclearity coinage metal nanoclusters can reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and form stable superatoms. This implies the hydride species can induce internal self-redox reactions (no external reducing agent needed) but as prerequisite the transformed clusters seem to have a similar core framework structure. These observations have implications in catalytic and energy cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-nuclearity clusters resemble the closest model between the determination of atomically precise chemical species and the bulk metallic version thereof, and both impacts on a variety of applications, including catalysis, optics, sensors, and new energy sources. Our interest lies with the nanoclusters of the Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) metals stabilized by dichalcogenido and hydrido ligands. Herein, we describe superatoms formed by the clusters and their relationship with precursor hydrido clusters. Specifically, our concept seeks to demonstrate a possible correlation that exist between hydrido clusters (and nanoalloys) and the formation of superatoms, with the loss of hydrides and typically with release of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. These reactions appear to be internal self-redox reactions and require no additional reducing agent, but does seem to require a similar core structure. Knowledge of such processes could provide insight into how clusters grow and an understanding in bridging the atomically precise cluster &#8211; metal nanoparticle mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pedal to the Metal: The Homogeneous Catalysis of the Native Chemical Ligation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic catalysis is key to the acceleration of the native chemical ligation (NCL) reaction and thus, to its application for protein synthesis, functionalization and utilization in chemical biology. The present concept article discusses the fundamental principles of NCL rate and catalysis with emphasis on thiol nucleophiles.







Abstract
The native chemical ligation reaction of peptide thioesters with cysteinyl peptides is a pivotal chemical process in the production of native or modified peptides and proteins, and well beyond in the preparation of various biomolecule analogs and materials. To benefit from this reaction at its fullest and to access all the possible applications, the experimentalist needs to know the factors affecting its rate and how to control it. This concept article presents the fundamental principles underlying the rate of the native chemical ligation and its homogeneous catalysis by nucleophiles. It has been prepared to serve as a quick guide in the search for an appropriate catalyst.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemical Protein Synthesis Utilizing Fmoc&#8208;Masked Selenazolidine to Address the Redox Functionality of Human Selenoprotein F**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of the ER human selenoprotein F using novel Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine is reported. This allowed us to perform different in&#8197;vitro biological characterizations, including redox potential determination, insulin turbidimetric assay, and the effect on the oxidative folding of Cys&#8208;rich protein models. Our results support that SELENOF acts as a reductase for non&#8208;native disulfide bonds in the ER.







Abstract
Human SELENOF is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) selenoprotein that contains the redox active motif CXU (C is cysteine and U is selenocysteine), resembling the redox motif of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases (CXXC). Like other selenoproteins, the challenge in accessing SELENOF has somewhat limited its full biological characterization thus far. Here we present the one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of SELENOF, highlighted by the use of Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine, native chemical ligations and deselenization reactions. The redox potential of the CXU motif, together with insulin turbidimetric assay suggested that SELENOF may catalyze the reduction of disulfides in misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELENOF is not a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)&#8208;like enzyme, as it did not enhance the folding of the two protein models; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin. These studies suggest that SELENOF may be responsible for reducing the non&#8208;native disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the quality control system in the ER.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Eucophylline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two strategies based respectively on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208; and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation of cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes were developed to achieve the total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline, a monoterpene alkaloid isolated from Leuconotis eugenifolius.







Abstract
The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline 1 was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The elaboration of the latter is based on two strategies relying on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208;cyanation and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation respectively of enantiopure substituted cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes. Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of 1, which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9&#8201;% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.

         <title>Parasitic Light Absorption, Rate Laws and Heterojunctions in the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Arsenic(III) Using Composite TiO2/Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanisms that control the kinetics of arsenic(III) photocatalytic oxidation when meso&#8208;TiO2 is coupled with an Fe2O3 adsorbent phase are investigated herein. Parasitic light absorption is the primary factor, followed by changes in rate law (from disguised zero&#8208;order to first order). Charge transfer across the heterojunction in our material is negligible.







Abstract
Composite photocatalyst&#8208;adsorbents such as TiO2/Fe2O3 are promising materials for the one&#8208;step treatment of arsenite contaminated water. However, no previous study has investigated how coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 influences the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III). Herein, we develop new hybrid experiment/modelling approaches to study light absorption, charge carrier behaviour and changes in the rate law of the TiO2/Fe2O3 system, using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), and kinetic analysis. Whilst coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 improves total arsenic removal by adsorption, oxidation rates significantly decrease (up to a factor of 60), primarily due to the parasitic absorption of light by Fe2O3 (88&#8201;% of photons at 368&#8197;nm) and secondly due to changes in the rate law from disguised zero&#8208;order kinetics to first&#8208;order kinetics. Charge transfer across this TiO2&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction is not observed. Our study demonstrates the first application of a multi&#8208;adsorbate surface complexation model (SCM) towards describing As(III) oxidation kinetics which, unlike Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood kinetics, includes the competitive adsorption of As(V). We further highlight the importance of parasitic light absorption and catalyst fouling when designing heterogeneous photocatalysts for As(III) remediation.

A highly efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous antibody&#8208;rhamnose and antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal cluster conjugates is described. The synthesis was achieved through a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide clusters. A comparative cell&#8208;based assay indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates showed potent complement&#8208;dependent targeted cancer cell killing by recruiting natural anti&#8208;rhamnose antibodies.







Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.

Visible&#8208;light photoswitching: A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. Visible&#8208;light photoswitching of the azobenzene&#8208;based ligand reversibly pumps the system away from equilibrium towards the thermodynamically unstable structure.







Abstract
A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the E&#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd3L6]6+ and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd4L8]8+ (1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio at 298&#8197;K). Irradiation with 410&#8197;nm light generates a photostationary state with approximately 80&#8201;% of the E&#8208;isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2&#8197;days at 333&#8197;K. The Z&#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25&#8197;days at 298&#8197;K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.

         <title>Dye&#8208;Conjugated Spinach RNA by Genetic Alphabet Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light emission by dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA transcripts can be generated by genetic alphabet expansion. Dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrates are site&#8208;specifically incorporated into Spinach RNA opposite to its unnatural base pairing partner in DNA templates by T7 transcription. The dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNAs or shorter versions robustly emit fluorescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8208;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrate is site&#8208;specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching. Furthermore, we applied our method to Baby Spinach, a shorter version of Spinach, for dye conjugation toward the visible detection of transcripts. This is the first demonstration of an alternative RNA imaging method for a detection system using genetic alphabet expansion.

         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two EuIII ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#8208;type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear EuIII complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear EuIII complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. This first spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a EuIII complex will offer new possibilities for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry.

         <title>Benchmarking of Density Functionals for the Description of Optical Properties of Newly Synthesized &#960;&#8208;Conjugated TADF Blue Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and computational guidelines based on benchmarking of DFT functionals for new &#960;&#8208;conjugated TADF emitters are reported. The three target compounds were obtained by multistep synthesis, including metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions and functional&#8208;group transformations. The emitters feature electron donors and acceptors moderately coupled through a spacer. The importance of the treatment of long&#8208;range exchange within the functionals and their ability to balance the &#960;&#8208;delocalization of the separate molecular fragments are explicitly outlined.







Abstract
Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer by &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high&#8208;energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient&#8208;corrected through global hybrids to range&#8208;separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long&#8208;range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;&#8208;electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta&#8208;GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They can predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthesis and computational guidelines&lt;/b&gt; based on benchmarking of DFT functionals for new &#960;-conjugated TADF emitters are reported. The three target compounds were obtained by multistep synthesis, including metal-catalyzed reactions and functional-group transformations. The emitters feature electron donors and acceptors moderately coupled through a spacer. The importance of the treatment of long-range exchange within the functionals and their ability to balance the &#960;-delocalization of the separate molecular fragments are explicitly outlined.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light-emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet-triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer by &#960;-electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high-energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient-corrected through global hybrids to range-separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long-range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;-electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta-GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They can predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissolution Behavior and Varied Mesoporosity of Zeolites by NH4F Etching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the particularities of zeolites dissolution topology, hidden mosaic structures and zeolite microporosity are identified as interlocking factors in shaping the final dissolution behavior of zeolites and the resultant mesoporosity pattern. The size, shape, concentration, and spatial distribution of the mosaic structures predefine the size and morphology of the void space left by dissolution. The dimensions and topology of the micropores determine the dissolution preference towards single framework atoms, interior mosaic blocks, or exterior features of zeolite crystals.







Abstract
The mesopores formation in zeolite crystals has long been considered to occur through the stochastic hydrolysis and removal of framework atoms. Here, we investigate the NH4F etching of representative small, medium, and large pore zeolites and show that the zeolite dissolution behavior, therefore the mesopore formation probability, is dominated by zeolite architecture at both nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;nano scales. At the nano&#8208;scale, the hidden mosaics of zeolite structure predetermine the spatio&#8208;temporal dissolution of the framework, hence the size, shape, location, and orientation of the mesopores. At the sub&#8208;nano scale, the intrinsic micropore size and connectivity jointly determine the diffusivity of reactant and dissolved products. As a result, the dissolution propensity varies from removing small framework fragments to consuming nanodomains and up to full digestion of the outmost part of zeolite crystals. The new knowledge will lead to new understanding of zeolite dissolution behavior and new adapted strategies for tailoring hierarchical zeolites.

         <title>Role of Anionic Backbone in NHC&#8208;Stabilized Coinage Metal Complexes: New Precursors for Atomic Layer Deposition**
</title>

         <dc:description>
In pursuit of new precursors for the deposition of coinage metals by atomic layer deposition (ALD), a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based CuI and AgI complexes has been synthesized, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential use in ALD. One precursor was found to be particularly useful for the deposition of metallic copper when using hydroquinone as the reducing agent in a thermally driven ALD process.







Abstract
Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic&#8208;layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals, namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based CuI and AgI complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(tBuNHC)(R)] (M=Cu, Ag; tBuNHC=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R=diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits by using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor&#8208;phase processing of thin films.

         <title>MOF Encapsulated AuPt Bimetallic Nanoparticles for Improved Plasmonic&#8208;induced Photothermal Catalysis of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 encapsulated AuPt alloy NPs exhibit a significant enhancement in the CO2 hydrogenation under low temperature (150&#8201;&#176;C). The outstanding performance of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 was attributed to the synergetic effect induced by plasmonic metal Au, active metal Pt, and versatile substrate UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Importantly, the AuPt alloy structure retains both the optical behavior of plasmonic metal and the reactive behavior of catalytic metal. This construction strategy provides guidance for the preparation of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
Exploring new catalytic strategies for achieving efficient CO2 hydrogenation under mild conditions is of great significance for environmental remediation. Herein, a composite photocatalyst Zr&#8208;based MOF encapsulated plasmonic AuPt alloy nanoparticles (AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) was successfully constructed for the efficient photothermal catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation. Under light irradiation at 150&#8201;&#176;C, AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 achieved a CO production rate of 1451&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 91&#8201;% selectivity, which far exceeded those obtained by Au@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with Pt shell on Au (599&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and Au@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (218&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The outstanding performances of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were attributed to the synergetic effect originating from the plasmonic metal Au, doped active metal Pt, and encapsulation structure of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 shell. This work provides a new way for photothermal catalysis of CO2 and a reference for the design of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.

         <title>The Apparently Unreactive Substrate Facilitates the Electron Transfer for Dioxygen Activation in Rieske Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantum chemical study of model complexes finds that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the Fe center of naphthalene dioxygenase through water reorientation and dioxygen binding are insensitive to the presence of naphthalene. The role of the substrate only becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation for the 6&#8208;coordinate Fe active site where an additional electron is likely to be first transfered to the naphthalene substrate. These results imply allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity.







Abstract
Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive 
 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to 
 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of 
, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme Fe
 center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic 
 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme Fe
 sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme Fe

     alt="The Apparently Unreactive Substrate Facilitates the Electron Transfer for Dioxygen Activation in Rieske Dioxygenases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A quantum chemical&lt;/b&gt; study of model complexes finds that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the Fe center of naphthalene dioxygenase through water reorientation and dioxygen binding are insensitive to the presence of naphthalene. The role of the substrate only becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation for the 6-coordinate Fe active site where an additional electron is likely to be first transfered to the naphthalene substrate. These results imply allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non-heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-dihydroxylation as well as &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non-heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive 
 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to 
 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6-coordinate to 5-coordinate conversion of the non-heme Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of 
, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin-state-dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non-heme Fe
 center through thermoneutral H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reorientation and exothermic 
 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe-oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6-coordinate non-heme Fe
 sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non-heme Fe
 in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive 
 activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Radical Ring&#8208;Opening/Pyridylation of Cyclobutanols with N&#8208;Methoxypyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed radical ring&#8208;opening/pyridylation of tertiary cyclobutanol with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts has been achieved for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;ketopyridines. The overall process is thought to occur by &#946;&#8208;scission of the corresponding cyclobutoxy radical to generate an alkyl radical, that adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with these reaction conditions.







Abstract
The silver&#8208;promoted reaction of tertiary cyclobutanols with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts enables the efficient synthesis of a range of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines. The overall process likely occurs by ring&#8208;opening (via &#946;&#8208;scission) of the cyclobutoxy radical to generate the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto alkyl radical that itself adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <title>Rational Design and Integrative Assembly of Heteromeric Metalla[2]Catenanes Featuring Cp*Ir/Rh Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric metalla[2]catenanes was realized on account of prior precise design. A new design strategy was proposed. The design strategy essentially follows the principle of shape complementarity. Based on careful rational design of the functional groups, the shape and the size of the building blocks, the integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric [2]catenanes were successfully achieved both by assembly of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and by one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
We report a design strategy for integrative assembly of heteromeric [2]catenanes. The design focuses on the shape and functional group match of two different metalla&#8208;rectangles. A series of dipyridyl ligands with different lengths, widths and functional groups were designed and used for assembly experiments. Six heteromeric [2]catenanes were obtained both by direct mixture of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. Multiple analytic methods were employed to characterize the catenanes, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. The method allows access to rare heterocycle&#8208;substituted vicinal chloroamines, aziridines, and vicinal diamines.







Abstract
We report a method for the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines using chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. We show the utility of the method as an approach to the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycle&#8208;substituted aziridines by treatment of the chloroamines with base in a one&#8208;pot process, as well as the utility of the process to allow access to vicinal diamines.

A series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential usage in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of coinage metal thin films. Employing the same set of diketonate&#8208;type ligands for both metals did result in thermally stable Cu(I) complexes suitable for ALD, while the Ag(I) complexes exhibit an inherently unstable nature and different bonding features.

         <dc:description>
Tribo&#8208;excitation in a crystalline compound is an interesting phenomenon in which a mechanical stimulus drives the compound to its excited state. We demonstrate a tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using trivalent europium (EuIII) and gadolinium (GdIII) complexes with stacked anthracene ligands for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry. The tribo&#8208;oxidation and &#8208;dimerization reactions in the stacked anthracene ligands occur in the EuIII and GdIII complexes, respectively. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Kitagawa, Y.&#8197;Hasegawa et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104401).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tribo-excitation in a crystalline compound&lt;/b&gt; is an interesting phenomenon in which a mechanical stimulus drives the compound to its excited state. We demonstrate a tribo-excited chemical reaction using trivalent europium (Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;) and gadolinium (Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;) complexes with stacked anthracene ligands for the development of tribo-excitation chemistry. The tribo-oxidation and -dimerization reactions in the stacked anthracene ligands occur in the Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Gd&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, respectively. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Kitagawa, Y.&#8197;Hasegawa et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202104401"&gt;10.1002/chem.202104401&lt;/a&gt;).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 16, March 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous nucleophilic catalysis is key to the acceleration of the native chemical ligation (NCL) reaction and thus to its application to protein semi or total synthesis and utilization in chemical biology. The concept article by V. Diemer et&#8197;al. discusses the fundamental principles of NCL rate and catalysis and is presented as a guide for readers in the search for an appropriate catalyst.

Structure, nature and future: This review classifies ferroelectric photocatalysts into perovskite, layered bismuth&#8208;based and other materials based on their crystal structure. Progress in ferroelectrics research is then summarized including photocatalytic pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, current challenges and future prospects are provided with the purpose for presenting a deep insight and guideline for future research into ferroelectrics.







Abstract
The rapid development of industrialization and population has brought water, air&#8208;pollution and energy crises. Solar&#8208;driven catalysis is expected to relieve these issues. However, limited by poor light harvesting, serious charge recombination of semiconductors, and high surface reaction barriers, the low efficiency of solar conversion is far from satisfactory for industrial needs. Ferroelectrics are considered to be promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3 and LiNbO3, layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6, and other ferroelectrics are introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method are highlighted. Subsequently, research progress in ferroelectrics for photocatalysis is summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts are provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present deep insight and a guideline for future research work into ferroelectrics.

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emissive Squaraine&#8208;AIEgen in Elastomer Enabling High Contrast and Fast Thermoresponse for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two challenges remain for organic thermoresponsive materials; one is to develop high performance red&#8208;emissive thermoresponsive materials, while another is to simultaneously achieve high contrast ratio (CR), fast and reversible thermoresponse in a single element. Herein, we not only develop a new deep&#8208;red emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen (TPE&#8208;SQ12) based on pyrylium end group, which is suitable for fabricating high performance thermoresponsive materials, but also show an effective approach to improve both CR (~ten times increase) and response time (less than 3 seconds), that is, molecularly dispersing AIEgen into an elastomer, attributed to the significantly expanded free volume of elastomer upon increasing the temperature that can activate the AIEgen intramolecular movements more pronouncedly. Double encryption and temperature mapping systems have been separately established using our designed elastomer/TPE&#8208;SQ12 film, showing the great potential for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing. Finally, white emission is further achieved by co&#8208;doping TPE&#8208;SQ12 with cyan dye into elastomer, which enables fluorescent thermochromism for improving the temperature mapping ability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The quest for the fluorophores exhibiting large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections and high fluorescence efficiency is an important topic. We herein disclosed two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithienyl derivatives, which contain two N,N&#8208;disubstituted amino and two dimesitylboryl groups at 3,3&#8217;&#8208; and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;positions, respectively. Despite the great steric effect of amino groups, the bithienyl skeleton still adopts a coplanar geometry. Herein, they are characterized by a quadrupolar structure and display good fluorescence efficiency and large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections up to 473 GM.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Bridged Triphenylamines Comprising Five&#8208; and Seven&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered rings is presented. The compounds are potent electron donors capable to undergo donor/acceptor interactions with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors both in the solid state and solution. These interactions were evaluated by IR and UV/vis spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. The vinylene&#8208;bridged compound was oxidized to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diketone which readily underwent acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with selected 1,2&#8208;phenylenediamines. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline derivatives represent valuable building blocks for the development of functional chromophores upon appropriate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: A Versatile Anticancer Tool with a Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow for precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of phospha&#8208;phenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to altered electronic distribution, may provide them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. Particularly, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show anti&#8208;proliferative properties in 14 cell lines including gliomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancer, reaching IC  50  values as low as 0.73 &#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with the photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;covalent Interactions in Molecular Systems: Thermodynamic Evaluation of the Hydrogen Bond Strength in Amino&#8208;ethers and Amino&#8208;alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra&#8208;HB) is one of the best known examples of non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bond in amino&#8208;alcohols and amino&#8208;ethers is one of the weakest. In contrast to the strong OH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N intramolecular hydrogen bond, the strength of the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O bond can hardly be measured with conventional spectroscopic methods, even for simple amino&#8208;alcohols, since the band belonging to the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O conformer merges with the free OH band. In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;ethanol and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O intra&#8208;HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined. In the second series, the influence of alkylation of the amino&#8208;group was investigated. In the third series, the effect of extending the alkyl chain between functional groups was studied.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic deracemization processes, such as crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs), offer the opportunity to combine racemization and resolution processes, to provide high yields of enantiomerically pure compounds. To date, few of these processes have incorporated photochemical racemization. By combining batch crystallization with a flow photoreactor for efficient irradiation, it is possible to perform such deracemization in an effective, scalable and high yielding manner. After applying design of experiment (DoE) principles and mathematical modelling, the most efficient parameter set could be identified, leading to excellent results in just 4 hours reaction time: isolated yield of 82% and assay ee of 96%. Such photochemical racemization methods can serve to open new avenues for preparation of enantiomerically pure functional molecules on both small and industrially&#8208;relevant scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxy groups enhance [2]rotaxane anion binding selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of two [2]rotaxanes containing an interlocked three dimensional binding cavity formed from a pyridinium bis(amide) axle component containing two phenol donors, and an isophthalamide based macrocycle. In the competitive solvent mixture 1:1 CDCl  3  :CD  3  OD, one of the receptors exhibits a much higher selectivity preference for chloride than an analogous rotaxane without the hydroxy groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveal the chloride anion guest encapsulated within the interlocked binding cavity, though not all of the hydrogen bond donors are utilised. Computational semi&#8208;empirical simulations indicate that secondary intermolecular interactions occur between the axle hydroxy hydrogen bond donors and the [2]rotaxane macrocycle components, contributing to a more preorganised binding pocket, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective ferric ions detection has been carried out with systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs. Among them, al the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions.







Abstract
The potential emergence of fluorescence&#8208;based techniques has propelled research towards developing probes that can sense trace metal ions specifically. Although luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are well suited for this application, the role of building blocks towards detection is not fully understood.

All the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. Detailed experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigation is carried out in addition to demonstration of UiO&#8208;67@N being able to sense trace amount of Fe3+ ions in synthetic biological water sample. Further, UiO&#8208;67@N based mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) has been prepared and employed to mimic the real time Fe3+ ions detection in water.

         <title>Topologically&#8208;Interlocked Minicircles as Probes of DNA Topology and DNA&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized the topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircle rotaxane and catenane inside a frame&#8208;shaped DNA origami. To probe the DNA&#8208;protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on the prepared interlocked structures and other DNAs with different topologies. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were reluctant for the restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA play a major role in DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
DNA minicircles exist in biological contexts, such as kinetoplast DNA, and are promising components for creating functional nanodevices. They have been used to mimic the topological features of nucleosomal DNA and to probe DNA&#8208;protein interactions such as HIV&#8208;1 and PFV integrases, and DNA gyrase. Here, we synthesized the topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircle rotaxane and catenane inside a frame&#8208;shaped DNA origami. These minicircles are 183 bp in length, constitute six individual single&#8208;stranded DNAs that are ligated to realize duplex interlocking, and adopt temporary base pairing of single strands for interlocking. To probe the DNA&#8208;protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on DNAs with different topologies such as free linear duplex or duplex constrained inside origami and free or topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircles. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were resistant to restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA, such as flexibility, curvature, and groove orientation, play a major role in DNA&#8208;protein interactions.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaromatization Route to Cycloparaphenylenes that Exhibit Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes via the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylenes with monoynes. The thus obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes, exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and are noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have ordinally AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenyl&#8208;ethene and benzene skeletons.







Abstract
A high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes has been developed via reductive aromatization of a diyne bearing two cyclohexadiene units giving a cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylene (CPE) followed by the cationic rhodium(I)/dppe complex&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition (cycloaromatization) of the CPE with monoynes. The thus&#8208;obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes ([8]CPPTs), exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). This molecule is noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have well&#8208;known AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenylethene and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraphenylbenzene skeletons. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of the AIE&#8208;active [8]CPPTs revealed their highly ordered packing structures in which the rotation of the triphenylene moieties is restricted.

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multi&#8208;Functionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioester&#8208;selective ketonization was achieved using diarylcuprates(I) generated in situ from copper(I) salts and aryl Grignard reagents in a 1:1.3&#8211;1.5 ratio under ambient temperature. During ketonization, various functional groups, such as carbonyl functionalities (ketones, esters, and amides), O &#8208;protecting groups, halogens, and heteroarenes, were tolerant to afford multi&#8208;functionalized ketones in excellent yields. This copper&#8208;mediated ketonization system was applicable for the synthesis of not only gluconic acid&#8208;derived ketone 6 as a synthetic intermediate in the transformation to canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, but also thiolactol 8 , a valuable synthetic intermediate for (+)&#8208;biotin. Control experiments using an isolated diphenylcuprate(I), [CuPh 2 ] &#8211; ( 12 ), and DFT calculations revealed that this ketonization proceeded via oxidative addition of the C&#8212;S bond of thioesters to [CuPh 2 ] &#8211; , and reductive elimination from the Cu(III) intermediate produced the corresponding ketone and an inactive species [(RS)CuPh] &#8211; , the latter of which reacted with [CuPh] 4 ( 11 ) to regenerate the reactive diphenylcuprate(I).</dc:description>

Molecular fishing: Quantum chemical calculations show the potential of several carbene&#8208;stabilized borylenes in capturing dinitrogen either as a borylene mono&#8208;adduct or as a bridging entity by two borylene moieties







Abstract
Computational investigations were carried out to probe the potential of several dicoordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes of the form [L&#8594;BR] (L=neutral Lewis base) in dinitrogen binding. The calculated reaction free energies and activation barriers associated with the formation of mono&#8208; and diborylene&#8208;N2 adducts suggest the presence of thermally surmountable kinetic barriers towards their possible isolation. Our results show that the exergonicity of dinitrogen activation and fixation is linearly dependent on the natural charge at the boron center, which can be tuned to design novel boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications to small&#8208;molecule activation. EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis reveals strong binding of dinitrogen to these base&#8208;stabilized borylenes.

Signalling in the red, when antibiotics are bound to novel dual functional donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted benzoxadiazole probes with unprecedented large Stokes shifts, containing a benzoylthiourea receptor for carboxylate binding and a tertiary amine&#8208;appended methacrylate linker for covalent matrix incorporation. The selective binding of a model antibiotic enoxacin is achieved by the integration of the polymerizable probes into molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) shells on submicron silica particles, the dyes retaining their red&#8208;shifted emission based on two concerted intramolecular charge transfer processes.







Abstract
Bifunctional fluorescent molecular oxoanion probes based on the benzoxadiazole (BD) chromophore are described which integrate a thiourea binding motif and a polymerizable 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate unit in the 4,7&#8208;positions of the BD core. Concerted charge transfer in this electron donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor architecture endows the dyes with strongly Stokes shifted (up to &gt;250&#8197;nm) absorption and fluorescence. Binding of electron&#8208;rich carboxylate guests at the thiourea receptor leads to further analyte&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts of the emission, shifting the fluorescence maximum of the complexes to &#8805;700&#8197;nm. Association constants for acetate are ranging from 1&#8211;5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. Integration of one of the fluorescent probes through its polymerizable moiety into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) grafted from the surface of submicron silica cores yielded fluorescent MIP&#8208;coated particle probes for the selective detection of antibiotics containing aliphatic carboxylate groups such as enoxacin (ENOX) at micromolar concentrations in highly polar solvents like acetonitrile.

         <title>Controlling Tautomerization in Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the reproducible access to stable, nonaromatic PN&#8208;heterocyclic quinoidal cores. The molecules exhibit solution and solid&#8208;state &#955;max red&#8208;shifts, and their solid&#8208;state structures exhibit tautomer&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Inclusion of a second nitrogen atom in the aromatic core of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen (PN) heterocycles results in unexpected tautomerization to a nonaromatic form. This tautomerization, initially observed in the solid state through X&#8208;ray crystallography, is also explained by computational analysis. We prepared an electron deficient analogue (2&#8201;e) with a fluorine on the pyridine ring and showed that the weakly basic pyridine resisted tautomerization, providing key insights to why the transformation occurs. To study the difference in solution vs. solid&#8208;state heterocycles, alkylated analogues that lock in the quinoidal tautomer were synthesized and their different 1H NMR and UV/Vis spectra studied. Ultimately, we determined that all heterocycles are the aromatic tautomer in solution and all but 2&#8201;e switch to the quinoidal tautomer in the solid state. Better understanding of this transformation and under what circumstances it occurs suggest future use in a switchable on/off hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed receptor that can be tuned for complementary hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Study: Importance of Detergent Core Flexibility in Protein Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem triazine&#8208;based maltoside with the ethylene diamine linker (i.&#8201;e., TZM&#8722;E9) conferred markedly enhanced stability to the tested membrane proteins compared to the hydrazine linker analog and the conventional dodecyl maltoside (DDM): prokaryotic leucine transporter (LeuT), human &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR), and mouse &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (MOR). The favorable behaviors of this detergent for membrane protein stability are mainly due to its foldable nature, originating from the flexible ethylene diamine linker present between the two triazine units.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are of biological and pharmaceutical significance. However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools are suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine&#8208;based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM&#8722;Hs) and 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (TZM&#8722;Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM&#8722;Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM&#8722;Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM&#8722;Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential in rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Based Approach to Developing Electrocatalytic Variants of Slow Oxidations: Application to Hydride Abstraction&#8208;Initiated Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxocarbenium and acyliminium ions can be generated with sub&#8208;stoichiometric loadings of oxoammonium ions under anhydrous conditions through in&#8197;situ electrochemical oxidant regeneration. Decomposition through radical cation intermediates can be avoided by using constant potential conditions and current is maintained through the interplay between cation stability, oxidant strength, overpotential, and reaction concentration.







Abstract
Electrochemical oxidant regeneration is challenging in reactions that have a slow redox step because the steady&#8208;state concentration of the reduced oxidant is low, causing difficulties in maintaining sufficient current or preventing potential spikes. This work shows that applying an understanding of the relationship between intermediate cation stability, oxidant strength, overpotential, and concentration on reaction kinetics delivers a method for electrochemical oxoammonium ion regeneration in hydride abstraction&#8208;initiated cyclization reactions, resulting in the development of an electrocatalytic variant of a process that has a high oxidation transition state free energy. This approach should be applicable to expanding the scope of electrocatalysis to include additional slow redox processes.

         <title>Engineering of Portable Smartphone Integrated with Liposome&#8208;Encapsulated Curcumin for Onsite Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Imaging of Hypochlorite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering of ClO&#8722; stimuli&#8208;responsive CCM&#8208;encapsulated liposome, a smartphone&#8208;assisted portable sensor for visual point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of ClO&#8722; was developed. Compared with other reported ratiometric fluorescent methods, the proposed ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe [Ru(bpy)3]2+@CCM&#8208;NPs exhibits a wider linear range and even higher sensitivity for ClO&#8722; detection. Moreover, the portable sensor demonstrated high practicality in real samples.







Abstract
Precisely onsite monitoring of hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;) is of great significance to guide its rational use, reducing/avoiding its potential threat toward food safety and human health. Considering ClO&#8722; could quench fluorescence of curcumin (CCM) by oxidizing the o&#8208;methoxyphenol of CCM into benzoquinone, a portable ratiometric fluorescence sensor integrated with smartphone was designed for realizing the visual point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of ClO&#8722;. The amphiphilic phospholipid polymer was used as carrier to wrap curcumin, forming a novel liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM, which provided a scaffold to bind with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ through electrostatic interaction, thus assembling [Ru(bpy)3]2+&#8208;functionalized liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM ([Ru(bpy)3]2+@CCM&#8208;NPs). Further integrated with smartphone, visual imaging of [Ru(bpy)3]2+@CCM&#8208;NPs could be achieved and the accurate onsite detection of ClO&#8722; could be realized with a detection limit of 66.31&#8197;nM and a linear range of 0.2210 to 80.0&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, the sensor could monitor ClO&#8722; in real samples with an onsite detection time of &#8764;154.0&#8197;s.

The amphiphilic phospholipid polymer was used as carrier to wrap curcumin, forming a novel liposome-encapsulated CCM, which provided a scaffold to bind with [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through electrostatic interaction, thus assembling [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-functionalized liposome-encapsulated CCM ([Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;@CCM-NPs). Further integrated with smartphone, visual imaging of [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;@CCM-NPs could be achieved and the accurate onsite detection of ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; could be realized with a detection limit of 66.31&#8197;nM and a linear range of 0.2210 to 80.0&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, the sensor could monitor ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in real samples with an onsite detection time of &#8764;154.0&#8197;s.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetranuclear Dicationic Aurophilic Gold(I) Catalysts in Enyne Cycloisomerization: Cooperativity for a Dramatic Shift in Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In comparison to mononuclear gold Lewis&#8208;acid catalysts, digold complexes and dual&#8208;gold catalysis have illustrated a distinct and powerful potential for the activation of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds. Herein, we pushed this concept further by designing novel tetranuclear gold(I) dicationic complexes structurally supported by strongly stabilizing constraint diphosphinoferrocenyl ligands and attractive closed&#8208;shell Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au aurophilic interactions. The use of a molecularly&#8208;defined tetranuclear dicationic aurophilic gold(I) precatalyst for the selectivity&#8208;challenging cycloisomerization of low&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes favors the formation with high selectivity of strained azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;enes &#8211;even in the complete absence of activating/orienting substituents on alkyne and olefin reactive functions. This selectivity is not achieved by the reported phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;stabilized mono&#8208; and dinuclear cationic gold(I) complexes, including the ones formed from the same ligands. More importantly this selectivity differs also from nanoparticles and heterogeneous gold catalysts reported to date. DFT studies correlated to experimental mechanistic investigations support an unprecedented &#8220;cluster&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity from polynuclear cooperation at the origin of this peculiar selectivity where the aurophilic interactions preexist, and pre&#8208;organize, gold cluster reactive intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength Orthogonal Photodynamic Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic properties allow materials to switch between two or more states, for example, fluorescence on/off, biocidal/cell&#8208;attracting. Implementation of such properties into materials requires the insertion of carefully tailored chromophores into polymer networks. The current concept article highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for current, red&#8208;shifted photodynamic networks, explores their limitations, and foreshadows the potential of future photodynamic networks once these limitations are overcome.







Abstract
The ability of light to remotely control the properties of soft matter materials in a dynamic fashion has fascinated material scientists and photochemists for decades. However, only recently has our ability to map photochemical reactivity in a finely wavelength resolved fashion allowed for different colors of light to independently control the material properties of polymer networks with high precision, driven by monochromatic irradiation enabling orthogonal reaction control. The current concept article highlights the progress in visible light&#8208;induced photochemistry and explores how it has enabled the design of polymer networks with dynamically adjustable properties. We will explore current applications ranging from dynamic hydrogel design to the light&#8208;driven adaptation of 3D printed structures on the macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale. While the alternation of mechanical properties via remote control is largely reality for soft matter materials, we herein propose the next frontiers for adaptive properties, including remote switching between conductive and non&#8208;conductive properties, hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, fluorescent or non&#8208;fluorescent, and cell adhesive vs. cell repellent properties.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cage&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101)&#160; with&#160; biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid was synthesized&#160; via solvothermal method. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octanuclear nickel&#8208;clusters&#160; that are connected with each other by the 4&#8208;connected bptc  4&#8208;  &#160;ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed&#8208;metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of M  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101&#160;(M = Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The &#160;electrochemical &#160;studies&#160; showed that the&#160; hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)&#160;activity of&#160; Cu  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101 is much higher than that of other&#160;M  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101&#160;catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the&#160; bimetallic centers. The optimized &#160; Cu  0.19  Ni  0.81  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101  &#160;  has an overpotential&#160;of 324 mV at&#160;10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a Tafel slope of 131&#160;mV&#160;dec  &#8208;1  . The mechanism of HER activity over these&#160; bimetallic MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Proton Transfer and Stabilizing Intermediates in Catalytic Water Oxidation via Hydrophobic Outer Sphere Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The outer coordination sphere of metalloenzyme often plays an important role in its high catalytic activity, however, this principle is rarely considered in the design of man&#8208;made molecular catalysts. Herein, four Ru&#8208;bda based molecular water oxidation catalysts with well&#8208;defined outer spheres are designed and synthesized. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the hydrophobic environment around the Ru center could lead to thermodynamic stabilization of the high&#8208;valent intermediates and kinetic acceleration of the proton transfer process during catalytic water oxidation. By this outer sphere stabilization, a 6&#8208;fold rate increase for water oxidation catalysis has been achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Dehydroxyazidation of Alcohols Promoted by Trifunctional Hypervalent Azido&#8208;Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of convenient new methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly desirable. Herein, we report a practical method for dehydroxyazidation of alcohols via an S  N  2 pathway involving PPh  3  and trifunctional benziodazolone&#8208;based hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents, which function as an electrophilic center, an azido source, and a base. We successfully used this mild, chemoselective method for late&#8208;stage azidation of structurally complex alcohols, as well as for a new synthetic route to the antiepileptic drug rufinamide. We also investigated the reaction mechanism both experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Class of Task&#8208;Specific Imidazolium Salts and Ionic Liquids and Their Corresponding Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes for Immobilization on Electrochemically Active Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of asymmetrically, para&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;bi&#8208; and terphenyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl substituted imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids and their corresponding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes for adsorption on surfaces were investigated concerning their structural, thermochemical and magnetic behavior. Moreover, the development of a hetero dinuclear complex as structural motif facilitates the structural and magnetic studies of surface&#8208;adsorbed ionic liquids.







Abstract
Adding to the versatile class of ionic liquids, we report the detailed structure and property analysis of a new class of asymmetrically substituted imidazolium salts, offering interesting thermal characteristics, such as liquid crystalline behavior, polymorphism or glass transitions. A scalable general synthetic procedure for N&#8208;polyaryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;functionalized imidazolium salts with para&#8208;substituted linker (L) moieties at the aryl chain, namely [LPhmImHR]+ (L=Br, CN, SMe, CO2Et, OH; m=2, 3; R=C12, PEGn; n=2, 3, 4), was developed. These imidazolium salts were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), NMR spectroscopy and thermochemical methods (DSC, TGA). Furthermore, these imidazolium salts were used as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand precursors for mononuclear, first&#8208;row transition metal complexes (MnII, FeII, CoII, NiII, ZnII, CuI, AgI, AuI) and for the dinuclear Ti&#8208;supported Fe&#8208;NHC complex [(OPy)2Ti(OPh2ImC12)2(FeI2)] (OPy=pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanolate). The complexes were studied concerning their structural and magnetic behavior via multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD analyses, variable temperature and field&#8208;dependent (VT&#8208;VF) SQUID magnetization methods, X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy and, where appropriate, zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy.

         <title>Oxidation of BINOLs by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents: Facile Synthesis of Xanthenes and Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of BINOLs promoted by hypervalent iodine reagents is leading to binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthenes and to nine&#8208;membered lactones in high yields. In the presence of alcohols this method provides a new strategy for the synthesis of alkoxylated xanthene derivatives.







Abstract
Xanthene derivatives have broad applications in medicines, fluorescent probes, dyes, food additives, etc. Therefore, much attention was focused on developing the synthetic methods to prepare these compounds. Binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthene derivatives were prepared through the oxidation of BINOLs promoted by the hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO). Nine&#8208;membered lactones were obtained through a similar oxidative reaction when iodoxybenzene (PhIO2) was used. Additionally, one&#8208;pot reactions of BINOLs, PhIO and nucleophiles such as alcohols and amines were also investigated to provide alkoxylated products and amides in good to excellent yields.

         <dc:description>
A Cu(I)/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of polyfluoroaryl allenyl sulfides with &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, generating chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides in good enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and &#945;&#8208;diazoesters is reported, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio&#8208;enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;diazoester has also been demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments, were conducted to gain insights into the details of the reaction pathway. The potential synthetic utility of this protocol has also been demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
Unprecedented bis&#8208;phosphaketenes, LM(PCO)2 (M=Ga, In) react with LGa to metallaphosphenes L(OCP)GaPML containing a delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron system within the Ga&#8722;P&#8722;M units, which selectively activate polar X&#8722;H bonds of aniline and phenol.







Abstract
Phosphaketenes are versatile reagents in organophosphorus chemistry. We herein report on the synthesis of novel bis&#8208;phosphaketenes, LM(PCO)2 (M=Ga 2&#8201;a, In 2&#8201;b; L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2; Ar=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) by salt metathesis reactions and their reactions with LGa to metallaphosphenes LGa(OCP)PML (M=Ga 3&#8201;a, In 3&#8201;b). 3&#8201;b represents the first compound with significant In&#8722;P &#960;&#8208;bonding contribution as was confirmed by DFT calculations. Compounds 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b selectively activate the N&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds of aniline and phenol at the Ga&#8722;P bond and both reactions proceed with a rearrangement of the phosphaethynolate group from Ga&#8722;OCP to M&#8722;PCO bonding. Compounds 2&#8211;5 are fully characterized by heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD).

         <title>Expanded Mercaptocalixarenes: A New Kind of Macrocyclic Ligands for Stabilization of Polynuclear Thiolate Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of expanded mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which four 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;thiophenolato units are joined by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NR(CH2)3NRCH2&#8722; linkers, has been achieved. The new macrocycles do not show the conformational isomerism typical of the parent mercaptocalix[4]arenes. The potential of these macrocycles to form mixed&#8208;ligand complexes with first row&#8208;transition metal ions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The syntheses and properties of expanded 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;mercaptocalix[4]arenes, in which the methylene linkers are replaced by &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; or &#8722;CH2NRCH2&#8722; and &#8722;CH2NRCH2CH2CH2NRCH2&#8722; units, are described. The new macrocycles were obtained in a step&#8208;wise manner, utilizing fully protected, i.&#8201;e. S&#8208;alkylated, derivatives of the oxidation&#8208;sensitive thiophenols in the cyclisation steps. Reductive cleavage of the macrobicyclic or macrotricyclic intermediates (6, 7, 11) afforded the free thiophenols (H48, H49, and H412) in preparative yields as their hydrochloride salts. The protected proligands can exist in two conformations, resembling the &#8220;cone&#8221; and &#8220;1,3&#8208;alternate&#8221; conformations found for the parent calix[4]arenes. The free macrocycles do not show conformational isomerism, but are readily oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide linkages. Preliminary complexation experiments show that these expanded mercaptocalixarenes can serve as supporting ligands for tetranuclear thiolato clusters.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using periodic DFT calculations, we have illustrated how selective binding of O2 over N2 and H2 occurs in Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). In particular, the role of spin state and spin coupling in selective gas binding is highlighted. As selective O2 binding is required for oxygen concentrators, the proposed idea has high commercial value. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Pal, G. Rajaraman et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104526).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of amines and alcohols with trifluoromethyl ketone N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is reported. This constitutes the most straightforward approach to access tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes in an efficient manner, featuring broad substrate scope, high yield, and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The direct gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of X&#8722;H bonds represents the most straightforward approach to access heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes that, as the isostere of the carbonyl group, have great potency in drug discovery. However, the construction of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes by this strategy is still an unsolved problem. Here, we report the first direct X&#8722;H bond gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of amines and alcohols with trifluoromethyl ketone N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones under silver (for (hetero)aryl hydrazones) or rhodium (for alkyl hydrazones), thereby providing a most powerful method for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. This method features a broad substrate scope, high product yield, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity (open air conditions). Moreover, the site&#8208;specific replacement of the carbonyl group with a gem&#8208;difluorovinyl ether bioisostere in drug Trimebutine and the post&#8208;modification of bioactive&#8201;molecules demonstrates potential use in medicinal research. Finally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by combining experiments and DFT calculations, and disclosed that the key step of HF elimination occurred via five&#8208;membered ring transition state, and the difference in the electrophilicity of Ag&#8208; and Rh&#8208;carbenes as well as the multiple intermolecular interactions rendered the effectiveness of Rh catalyst selectively for alkyl hydrazones.

Abstract
A versatile asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic pyrazolidinones through alkaloid&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2]&#8208; and [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of ketenes with azomethine imines is described. The methodology was found to be tolerant of ketene and a variety of monosubstituted ketenes (R=alkyl, OAc). The products were formed in good to excellent yields (71&#8211;99&#8201;% for 24 examples, 39 examples in all), with good to excellent diastereoselectivity in many cases (dr 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 to 27&#8201;:&#8201;1 for 22 examples), and with excellent enantioselectivity for most examples (&#8805;93&#8201;% ee for 34 products). In the case of most disubstituted ketenes, the reaction proceeded through a [3+2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition to form structurally interesting bicyclic pyrazolo&#8208;oxadiazepinediones with moderate diastereoselectivity (dr up to 3.7&#8201;:&#8201;1) and as racemic mixtures (3 examples). The method represents the first unambiguous example of an enantioselective reaction between ketenes and a 1,3&#8208;dipole.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Coupling Reactions Using Air as Sole Oxidant**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative carbon&#8722;heteroatom bond formations using air as sole oxidant provide a variety of oxygenated and aminated arylamines as well as aminated phenols. The appropriate additive (Br&#248;nsted acid, Lewis acid, or base) is crucial for these couplings. The mild oxidative reaction proceeds at room temperature and represents a powerful alternative to traditional carbon&#8722;heteroatom couplings.







Abstract
We describe the oxygenation of tertiary arylamines, and the amination of tertiary arylamines and phenols. The key step of these coupling reactions is an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8722;O or C&#8722;N bond formation which generally provides the corresponding products in high yields and with excellent regioselectivity. The transformations are accomplished using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8722;iron(II) (FePcF16) as catalyst in the presence of an acid or a base additive and require only ambient air as sole oxidant.

         <title>Structure Engineering of BiSbSx Nanocrystals Embedded within Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Fibers for High Performance of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BiSbSx@sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (BiSbSx@SPAN) composite is fabricated through electrospinning followed by sulfuration treatment. When employed as an anode of PIBs, it maintains a large reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance (472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as promising candidates in next&#8208;generation energy storage technology; however, the electrode materials in PIBs are usually restricted by the shortcomings of large volume expansion and poor cycling stability stemming from a high resistance towards diffusion and insertion of large&#8208;sized K ions. In this study, BiSbSx nanocrystals are rationally integrated with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibres through electrospinning technology with an annealing process. Such a unique structure, in which BiSbSx nanocrystals are embedded inside the SPAN fibre, affords multiple binding sites and a short diffusion length for K+ to realize fast kinetics. In addition, the molecular structure of SPAN features robust chemical interactions for stationary diffluent discharge products. Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an excellent reversible capacity of 790&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles) and 472&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles). It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibers.

         <title>Insights into the Electronic Structure of a U(IV) Amido and U(V) Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the compound [U(V)(TMSI)Cl5], uranium could be stabilized in the rare +V oxidation state proven by HERFD XANES measurements. In the complex, an inverse trans influence (ITI) was uncovered. Quantum chemical calculations show this effect to be dependent on the electronic situation on the metal centre, thus increasing with higher oxidation state.







Abstract
Reaction of the N&#8208;heterocylic carbene ligand iPrIm (L1) and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (TMSA) as a base with UCl4 resulted in U(IV) and U(V) complexes. Uranium's +V oxidation state in (HL1)2[U(V)(TMSI)Cl5] (TMSI=trimethylsilylimido) (2) was confirmed by HERFD&#8208;XANES measurements. Solid state characterization by SC&#8208;XRD and geometry optimisation of [U(IV)(L1)2(TMSA)Cl3] (1) indicated a silylamido ligand mediated inverse trans influence (ITI). The ITI was examined regarding different metal oxidation states and was compared to transition metal analogues by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Irreversible inhibition of IspG, a target for the development of new antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of its MEcPP substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighbouring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we showed that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition, which might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Catalyst for Preparation of Thiophosphinates from Phosphine Oxides and Thiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF) or 2',5'&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1':4',1''&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4''&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF) under solvothermal conditions. These two COFs were further facilely developed as efficient photocatalytic platforms for the synthesis of thiophosphinates. Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibited better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability, and excellent recycling capacity for the preparation of thiophosphinates from P(O)H compounds and thiols compared to Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF. This methodology was further extended to the seamless gram&#8208;scale production of target phosphorothioate derivatives. The results demonstrate that COFs can provide a robust platform for developing metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, highly efficient, and reusable heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase Sensing Based on Protein Interactions at the Catalytic Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical biosensor has been developed that is based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection. We adsorbed the phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, on gold electrodes and were able to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Friedler, S. Yitzchaik et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104227).

         <dc:description>
Comprehensive characterization of shredded lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) recycling material was performed. As a result, a toolbox for analysis of these complex samples compromising various electrolyte, active and inactive materials is provided. By means of extraction and pyrolysis with subsequent chromatography and mass spectrometry&#8208;based analyses for example identification of hazardous species and polymer binder residues on trace level was enabled.

Abstract
Herein we report on an analytical study of dry&#8208;shredded lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials with unknown composition. Samples from an industrial recycling process were analyzed concerning the elemental composition and (organic) compound speciation. Deep understanding of the base material for LIB recycling was obtained by identification and analysis of transition metal stoichiometry, current collector metals, base electrolyte and electrolyte additive residues, aging marker molecules and polymer binder fingerprints. For reversed engineering purposes, the main electrode and electrolyte chemistries were traced back to pristine materials. Furthermore, possible lifetime application and accompanied aging was evaluated based on target analysis on characteristic molecules described in literature. With this, the reported analytics provided precious information for value estimation of the undefined spent batteries and enabled tailored recycling process deliberations. The comprehensive feedstock characterization shown in this work paves the way for targeted process control in LIB recycling processes.

         <title>Epigenetic anti&#8208;cancer treatment with a stabilized carbocyclic Decitabine analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;Aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (Decitabine, AzadC) is a nucleoside analogue, which is in clinical use to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Its mode of action is unusual because the compound is one of the few drugs that act at the epigenetic level of the genetic code. AzadC is incorporated as an antimetabolite into the genome and creates covalent, inhibitory links to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that methylate 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC). Consequently, AzadC treatment leads to a global loss of mdC, which presumably results in a reactivation of silenced genes, among them tumor suppressor and DNA damage response genes. Because AzadC suffers from severe instability, which limits its use in the clinic, a more sophisticated AzadC derivative would be highly valuable. Here, we report that a recently developed carbocyclic AzadC analogue (cAzadC) blocks DNMT1 in the AML cell line MOLM&#8208;13 as efficient as AzadC. Moreover, cAzadC has a surprisingly strong anti&#8208;proliferative effect and leads to a significantly higher number of double strand breaks compared to AzadC, while showing less off&#8208;target toxicity. These results show that cAzadC triggers more deleterious repair and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells than AzadC, which makes cAzadC a promising next generation epigenetic drug.</dc:description>

         <title>An allyl uranium(IV) sandwich complex: are &#966; bonding interactions possible?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to explore head&#8208;to&#8208;head &#966; backbonding from uranium f&#8208;orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals was pursued. The coordination of anionic allyl groups to uranium was achieved via tethered anilide ligands, and the products were investigated using NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enylsilyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline ( LH ), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI  2  ( L1 )  2  ( 1 ), which was synthesized using the mono&#8208;deprotonated ligand [K][N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)silyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L1 ). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U( L2 )  2  ( 2 ) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but most consistent results came from the use of the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]  2  [N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enidesilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L2 ). This allyl&#8208;based sandwich complex was studied using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#966;) backbonding. The bonding between the U(IV) and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron donation from two&#8208;carbon&#8208;fragment localized electron density into empty f&#8208;orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles and activation volumes of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene dimerizations computed by the extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1 atm and high pressures up the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1 atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently&#8208;developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent receptor&#8208;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, that can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, that has been recently introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative  E  /  Z  photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the  Z  isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the  E  isomer to crosslinking binding of the  Z  isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Chiral Rhodium Complexes of 1,4&#8208;Benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral rhodium complexes are widely used in asymmetric catalysis. They usually contain intrinsically chiral ligands that provide the desired stereoselectivity. The quinone ligand, just like the playing card in the picture, is planar and thus not chiral. However, upon coordination with rhodium, the symmetry plane is removed, and a chiral complex appears. By using the appropriate auxiliary ligand, or by taking the card with the &#8220;right&#8221; hand, one can create chiral quinone complexes with exceptional stereoselectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;M. Ankudinov, Yu.&#8197;V. Nelyubina and D.&#8197;S. Perekalin (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200195).

         <title>Evidence of Kinetically Relevant Consistency in Thermal and Photo&#8208;Thermal HCOOH Decomposition over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 Composite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together photo&#8208; and thermal energy promote catalytic reactions in a synergetic way. However, how light cooperates with thermal energy is still unclear. Here, C&#8722;H bond rupture within HCOOH* was determined to be the rate&#8208;determining step, with adsorbed CO* as the most abundant surface intermediate under both thermal and photothermal reaction conditions, as confirmed by kinetic isotopic effects and in&#8208;situ FTIR characterizations. Clear evidence of kinetically relevant consistency was found under both thermal and photothermal HCOOH decomposition reactions over a Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 composite. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104623).

Here, C&#8722;H bond rupture within HCOOH* was determined to be the rate-determining step, with adsorbed CO* as the most abundant surface intermediate under both thermal and photothermal reaction conditions, as confirmed by kinetic isotopic effects and in-situ FTIR characterizations. Clear evidence of kinetically relevant consistency was found under both thermal and photothermal HCOOH decomposition reactions over a Pd/LaCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; composite. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202104623"&gt;10.1002/chem.202104623&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Control of Crystallinity of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers by Rational Monomer Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal the control of crystallinity during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylenequinoxalinevinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPVs) through the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) polycondensation by the employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks.







Abstract
The interest in two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs) has increased significantly in recent years. In particular, vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs with fully in&#8208;plane sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated structures, high thermal and chemical stability, have become the focus of attention. Although the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction has been recently demonstrated in synthesizing vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, it remains largely unexplored due to the challenge in synthesis. In this work, we reveal the control of crystallinity of 2D CPs during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;quinoxaline&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s through the HWE polycondensation. The employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks is demonstrated as crucial factors in enhancing the crystallinity of the obtained 2D CPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the critical role of the fluorinated phosphonate in enhancing the reversibility of the (semi)reversible C&#8722;C single bond formation.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Using periodic DFT calculations, we have studied in detail a Cr MOF for selective O2 binding and show that the spin state and spin coupling between the metals are crucial for gas separation.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202104526).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Sourav Pal, Gopalan Rajaraman and co&#8208;workers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research. The image depicts how a mixture of atmospheric gases such as CO2, H2, N2 and O2 can be selectively separated using a Cr metal&#8208;organic framework where spin state and spin coupling play a crucial role.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Charge Transfer in Strongly Interacting Diphenothiazone&#8208;TCBD and Diphenothiazine&#8208;DCNQ Push&#8208;Pull Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three types of phenothiazines dimers (PTZ&#8208;PTZ,  1&#8211;3  ), covalently linked with one or two acetylene linkers, were synthesized by copper&#8208;mediated Eglinton and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions in excellent yields. The dimers  1&#8211;3  were further engaged in [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reactions with strong electron acceptors, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) to yield tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD,  1a&#8211;3a  ), and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ,  1b&#8211;3b  ) functionalized donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugates, respectively. The conjugates were examined by a series of spectral, computational, and electrochemical studies. Strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) leading to new optical transitions was witnessed in both series of D&#8208;A conjugates. In the case DCNQ derived D&#8208;A system  1b  , the optical coverage extended until 1200 nm in benzonitrile, making this a rare class of D&#8208;A ICT system. Multiple redox processes were witnessed in these D&#8208;A systems, and the frontier orbitals generated on DFT optimized structures further supported the ICT phenomenon. Photochemical studies performed using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies confirmed solvent polarity dependent excited state charge transfer and separation in these novel multi&#8208;modular D&#8208;A conjugates. The charge&#8208;separated state in benzonitrile lasted for 30  &#8211;  40 ps owing to the close proximity of the push&#8208;pull entities in these conjugates. The significance of diphenothiazine in wide&#8208;band optical capture all the way into the near&#8208;IR region and promoting ultrafast photoinduced charge separation in the D&#8208;A&#8208;D configured multi&#8208;modular systems were the direct outcome of the present study.</dc:description>

         <title>Cocrystal Formation Precedes the Mechanochemically Acetate&#8208;Assisted C&#8211;H Activation with [Cp*RhCl2]2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we studied experimentally the mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 in the presence of NaOAc. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8211;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.</dc:description>

         <title>Different Topologies of Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine 1D Coordination Polymers: Dynamic Behaviour in Solvent Adsorption and Exchange Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) featuring three different topologies, comprising zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane structures, were obtained by reaction of Hg(II) ions with a novel bispidine ligand  L3  , and structurally characterized by SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD methods. The CPs obtained in the form of microcrystalline powders were tested for their ability to undergo solvent adsorption and exchange by P&#8208;XRD and  1  H&#8208;NMR. The extent of their dynamic behavior was then correlated to their structural features, highlighting the role of interchain interactions established among their constituting linear arrays. Zig&#8208;zag CPs proved to be resilient to external chemical stimuli, while they differently respond to thermal treatments, depending on the solvent originally included within the CP. In the case of polycatenated structure, we observed transformations where the original topology was maintained upon guest exchange, but also cases where it changed to zig&#8208;zag, even under solid/vapour conditions (  i.e.  , no complete dissolution of the CP). Given the presence of linear interconnected 1D channels,  3&#8729;ClBz&#8208;polycatenane  Pwd  is also able to trap volatile guests such as  n  &#8208;hexane when exposed to its vapours.</dc:description>

         <title>On the existence and role of formaldehyde during aqueous electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol by cobalt phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;time challenge in aqueous CO2 electrochemical reduction is to catalyze the formation of products beyond carbon monoxide with selectivity. Formaldehyde is the simplest of these products and one of the most relevant due to its broad use in the industry. Paradoxically it is one of the less reported product. Such scarcity may be in part explained by difficult identification and quantification using conventional chromatography or proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Likewise, indirect detection methods are usually not compatible with labelled study for asserting product origin. Recently, the possible production of formaldehyde during electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol at cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst in basic media has been the object of contradictory reports. Applying an analytical procedure based on proton NMR along with labelled studies, we provide definitive evidence for HCHO formation. We have further identified the possible scenarios for methanol formation through formaldehyde and revealed that the formation of the intermediate and its subsequent reduction are taking place at the same single active site. These studies open a new perspective to improve selectivity toward formaldehyde formation and to develop a subsequent chemistry based on reacting it with nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell imaging has unique advantages of maintaining the in situ physiological state, morphology, and microenvironment, becoming a powerful tool to unravel the nature of intracellular nucleic acids. The analysis of nucleic acids unprecedentedly demands the sub&#8208;molecule details at segment or subunit, secondary structure and monomer levels, instead of just probing the sequence and the abundance of nucleic acids. Detection of nucleic acids at the sub&#8208;molecule level requires higher specificity and higher sensitivity, which becomes a new challenge in nucleic acid analysis. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in the design and the application of single&#8208;cell nucleic acid imaging methods at the sub&#8208;molecule level, including the visualization of RNA splicing variants, RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in an individual gene, single nucleotide variation of mitochondrial DNA, and RNA m6A methylation. Remarkably, we highlight the key strategy, &#8220;Module Assembly&#8221;, for high&#8208;performance molecular recognition and demonstrate the required improvements in future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Marriage of Heterobuckybowls with Triptycene: Molecular Waterwheels for Separating C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles have been created by fusing the heterobuckybowls and triptycene. The molecular waterwheels are excellent fullerene receptors that can be used to separate C60 and C70 from their mixture.







Abstract
Exploration of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles, particularly those have &#960;&#8208;frameworks spread over the three&#8208;dimensional space, is essential in materials science and synthetic chemistry as these chemical entities possess featured optoelectronic properties and supramolecular assembly. Herein, the bowl&#8208;shaped trichalcogenasumanenes are fused onto three branches of triptycene through pyrazine units, affording waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b. Because the three branches on 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are chemically equal, the molecular orbitals of 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b show degenerate feature that results in the strong UV&#8208;Vis absorbance at steady state. 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b exhibit photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation and subsequent charge&#8208;redistribution at transient state, leading to excited state absorption in NIR&#8208;II window (1165&#8211;1400&#8197;nm). 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are excellent fullerene receptors, and they form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complexes with C60/C70 as proved by spectroscopic titrations and single crystal structure analysis. Moreover, 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b show much stronger affinity toward C70 than C60. Consequently, 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are able to separate C60 and C70 from their mixture, giving the purity of C60 up to 99.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Nanohybridization of CoS2/MoS2 Heterostructure with Polyoxometalate on Functionalized Reduced Graphene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance LIBs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To take full advantages of enriched charge storage capabilities of CoS2/MoS2, the high electrical conductivity of PDDA&#8208;rGO, the multi&#8208;electron transfer of PMo12, the CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites were successfully fabricated and explored as anode materials for rechargeable LIBs. The CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites show superior energy storage behavior and rate capability for LIBs, which provides a scientific basis for solving the problems of poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS2 as electrode materials for LIBs.







Abstract
To address the poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS2 as electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), herein, the CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites are constructed via a simple hydrothermal process, combining the advantages of all three, namely, CoS2/MoS2 heterojunction and polyoxometalates (POMs) provide abundant catalytically active sites and increase the multi&#8208;electron transfer ability, and the positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified reduced graphene oxide (PDDA&#8208;rGO) improve electronic conductivity and effectively prevent the aggregation of MoS2, meanwhile stabilize the negatively charged [PMo12O40]3&#8722;. After the electrochemical testing, the resulting CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposite achieved 1055&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 initial specific capacities and stabilized at 740&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density. And the specific capacities of MoS2, MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO, CoS2/MoS2, and CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO were 201, 421, 518, and 589 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles, respectively. The fact of the greatly improving capacity of MoS2&#8208;based nanocomposites suggests its potential for high performance electrode materials of LIBs. Moreover, the lithium storage mechanism of CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 has been discussed on the basis of cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Chemoenzymatic Installation of Hydroxy&#8208;Bearing Allyl Moiety on the Indole Ring of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>

         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage functionalization of indole&#8208; and tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;containing compounds with reactive moieties facilitates downstream diversification and leads to changes in their biological properties. The synthesis of two hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl pyrophosphates is described and a chemoenzymatic method is demonstrated which uses a promiscuous indole prenyltransferase (IPT) enzyme to install a dual reactive hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl group directly on the indole ring of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides.

         <title>Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Generated In Situ from Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Oxo Complexes by Tuning Pendant Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deficient &amp; efficient. Molecularly defined Mo oxo compounds, MoOCl2(OR)2(OEt2), generate in&#8197;situ olefin metathesis catalyst upon activation with an organosilicon reducing agent in the presence of olefins. Their catalytic activity correlates with 95Mo chemical shift and reduction potential, pointing out the need of electron&#8208;poor &#963;&#8208;donating ligands in this series.







Abstract
Tailored molybdenum(VI)&#8208;oxo complexes of the form MoOCl2(OR)2(OEt2) catalyse olefin metathesis upon reaction with an organosilicon reducing agent at 70&#8201;&#176;C, in the presence of olefins. While this reactivity parallels what has recently been observed for the corresponding classical heterogeneous catalysts based on supported metal oxide under similar conditions, the well&#8208;defined nature of our starting molecular systems allows us to understand the influence of structural, spectroscopic and electronic characteristics of the catalytic precursor on the initiation and catalytic proficiency of the final species. The catalytic performances of the pre&#8208;catalysts are determined by the highly electron withdrawing (&#963;&#8208;donation) character of alkoxide ligands, OtBuF9 being the best. This activity correlates with both the 95Mo chemical shift and the reduction potential that follows the same trend: OtBuF9&gt;OtBuF6&gt;OtBuF3.

         <title>Fast and Cysteine&#8208;Specific Modification of Peptides, Proteins and Bacteriophage Using Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast and cysteine&#8208;specific modifications are reported using chlorooximes. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent under physiological conditions. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in&#8197;situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. These methods are applied to native peptide modification, proteins modification, and chemically modified phage libraries construction.







Abstract
This work reports a novel chlorooxime mediated modification of native peptides and proteins under physiologic conditions. This method features fast reaction kinetics (apparent k2=306&#177;4&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1 for GSH) and exquisite selectivity for cysteine residues. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with just single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in&#8197;situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. Furthermore, a bis&#8208;chlorooxime reagent is synthesized to enable facile Cys&#8208;Cys stapling in native peptides and proteins. This highly efficient cysteine conjugation and stapling was further implemented on bacteriophage to construct chemically modified phage libraries.

Oxidative fusion of meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin&#8208;bis&#8208;ZnII [36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid trimer afforded a triply&#8208;linked hybrid tape as the first example of porphyrin tapes exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity. The electronic conjugation was fully extended over the whole molecule, showing red&#8208;shifted absorption up to 1274&#8197;nm. The extent of electronic perturbation was compared with planar porphyrin&#8208;[26]hexaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid tape to illuminate the consequence of twisted &#960;&#8208;surface.

Abstract
Directly meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin&#8208;tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid trimer 10 was successfully synthesized via acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction and subsequent oxidation. ZnII&#8208;metalation of 10 induced transannular meso&#8208;meso bond formation to give M&#246;bius aromatic bis&#8208;ZnII octaphyrin 11, which was oxidized by DDQ/Sc(OTf)3 to provide fully conjugated porphyrin&#8208;[36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid tape 12 as the first example of porphyrin tape exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity. Hybrid tape 12 displays significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption and small electrochemical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, indicating the effective conjugation through the whole chromophores.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Their Integrated Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular catalysts (metal complexes), with molecularly defined uniform active sites and atomically precise structural tailorability allowing for regulating catalytic performance through metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered engineering and elucidating reaction mechanisms via routine photoelectrochemical characterizations, have been increasingly explored for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). However, their poor stability and low catalytic current density are undesirable for practical applications. Heterogenizing discrete molecular catalysts can potentially surmount these issues and the resulting integrated catalysts largely share catalytical properties with their discrete molecular counterparts, which bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and combine their advantages. This minireview surveys advances in design and regulation of molecular catalysts such as porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bipyridine&#8208;based metal complexes and their integrated catalytic materials for selective ECR.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial Phosphorization: A Strategy to Improve Some Performance(s) of Thiolated Metal Nanoclusters without Notable Reduction of Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiolates endow metal nanoclusters with stability while sometimes inhibit the catalytic activity due to the strong M&#8208;S interaction (M: metal atom). To improve the catalytic activity and keep the stability to some extent, one strategy is the partial phosphorization of thiolated metal nanoclusters. We demonstrated this by successfully realizing partial phosphorization of  Au  23  (SC  6  H  11  )  16  and revealing that the variously phosphorization&#8208;degreed products Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  14  (PPh  3  )  2  and  Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  both show excellent activity in photocatalytic oxidation of thioanisole without notable reduction of stability. Furthermore, it is found that Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  exhibits better photoluminescence performance than the mother nanocluster Au  23  (SC  6  H  11  )  16  , indicating that partial phosphorization can also improve some other performance(s) except for the catalytic performance.  Another point of this work is that the intermediates Au  22&#8208;x  Cu  x  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  (x = 1, 2) in the transformation from Au  23  (SC  6  H  11  )  16  (Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  14  (PPh  3  )  2  ) to Au  22  (SC  6  H  11  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  were captured and identified by mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which throw some light on the understanding of non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction  .</dc:description>

         <title>Formation Mechanism of a Nano Ring of Bismuth Cations and Mono&#8208;Lacunary Keggin&#8208;Type Phosphomolybdate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new hetero&#8208;bimetallic polyoxometalate (POM) nano ring was synthesized in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The structure consists of tetrameric units containing four bismuth&#8208;substituted monolacunary Keggin anions including distorted [BiO8] cubes. The nano ring is formed via self &#8208;assembly from metal precursors in aqueous acidic medium. The compound (NH 4 ) 16 [(BiPMo 11 O 39 ) 4 ]&#215;22H 2 O; (P 4 Bi 4 Mo 44 ) was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), Raman spectroscopy, matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation&#8208;time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF), and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry (TG&#8208;DSC&#8208;MS). The formation of the nano ring in solution was studied by time&#8208;resolved in situ small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and in situ EXAFS measurements at the Mo&#8208;K and the Bi&#8208;L 3 edge indicating a two&#8208;step process consisting of condensation of Mo&#8208;anions and formation of Bi&#8208;Mo&#8208;units followed by a rapid self&#8208;assembly to yield the final tetrameric ring structure.</dc:description>

The linear extended  4,4&#8217;&#8208;bphdba  exhibited the formation of 1:1 cocrystals [(  4,4&#180;&#8208;bphdba  )(  bpe  )] (  5  ) and [(  4,4&#180;&#8208;bphdba&#8208;me  )(  bpeta  )] (  6  ). For  6  , a hemiester was generated by an  in situ  linker transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In  1  and  3  , the C=C bonds of the  bpe  molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of  bpe  into cyclobutane  tpcb  . The reactivity involving  1  occurred via 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.</dc:description>

The linear extended  4,4&#8217;-bphdba  exhibited the formation of 1:1 cocrystals [(  4,4&#180;-bphdba  )(  bpe  )] (  5  ) and [(  4,4&#180;-bphdba-me  )(  bpeta  )] (  6  ). For  6  , a hemiester was generated by an  in situ  linker transformation. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O  w  &#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8211;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen-bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In  1  and  3  , the C=C bonds of the  bpe  molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of  bpe  into cyclobutane  tpcb  . The reactivity involving  1  occurred via 1D-to-2D single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfonyl Nitrene and Amidyl Radical: Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic generation of nitrenes and radicals can be used to tune or even control their reactivity. Photocatalytic activation of sulfonyl azides leads to the elimination of N  2  and the resulting reactive species initiate C&#8208;H activations and amide formation reactions. Here, we present reactive radicals that are generated from sulfonyl azides: sulfonyl nitrene radical anion, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radical, and test their gas phase reactivity in C&#8208;H activation reactions. The sulfonyl nitrene radical anion is the least reactive and its reactivity is governed by the proton coupled electron transfer mechanism. In contrast, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radicals react via hydrogen atom transfer pathways. These reactivities and detailed characterization of the radicals with vibrational spectroscopy and with DFT calculations provide information necessary for taking control over the reactivity of these intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structure Correction of the Cyclic Lipodepsipeptide Orfamide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the total synthesis of orfamide A an efficient synthesis format for cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural products on solid phase was developed. A strategy using side chain anchoring, an ester building block, and O&#8594;N acyl migration suppression enabled high&#8208;yielding synthesis on solid support and facilitated compound library synthesis. The configuration of the proposed structure of orfamide A was corrected at two positions. Studies in Chlamydomonas algae uncovered the impact of orfamide A stereochemistry on compound bioactivity.







Abstract
A total synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural product orfamide A was achieved. By developing a synthesis format using an aminoacid ester building block and SPPS protocol adaptation, a focused library of target compounds was obtained, in high yield and purity. Spectral and LC&#8208;HRMS data of all library members with the isolated natural product identified the 5Leu residue to be d&#8208; and the 3&#8217;&#8208;OH group to be R&#8208;configured. The structural correction of orfamide A by chemical synthesis and analysis was confirmed by biological activity comparison in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which indicated compound configuration to be important for bioactivity. Acute toxicity was also found against Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite causing African sleeping sickness.

         <dc:description>The transition metal Fe, Co, Ni and Cu doped strontium titanate&#8208;rich SrTiO  3  @TiO  2  (STO@T) materials were prepared by hydrothermal method. The prepared doped materials exhibit better photocatalytic CO  2  reduction to CH  4  ability under visible light conditions. Among them, Fe&#8208;doped and undoped SrTiO  3  @TiO  2  under visible light conditions CO  2  reduction products only CO, while M&#8208;STO@T (M=Co, Ni, Cu) samples converted CO  2  to CH  4  . The average methane yield of Ni&#8208;doped STO@T samples are as high as 73.85 &#956;mol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  . The production of methane is mainly due to the increase in the response of the doped samples to visible light. And the increase in the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficiency of electron transport caused by the generation of impurity levels. The impurity level caused by Ti  3+  plays an important role in the production of methane by CO  2  visible light reduction. Ni doping effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of STO@T and CO  2  reduction mechanism were explained.</dc:description>

Thanks to the extensive research efforts dedicated to the development of polymer acceptors, all&#8208;PSCs have achieved remarkable improvement of photovoltaic performance, recently. This review summarizes the recent progress o  f polymer acceptors based on the key electron&#8208;deficient building blocks,  which  include bithiophene diimide (BTI) derivatives,  boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N)&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). In addition, single&#8208;component&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs are also briefly discussed. The structure&#8208;property correlations of polymer acceptors are elaborated in details.

         <title>The non&#8208;ancillary nature of trimethylsilylamide substituents in boranes and borinium cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The known boranes [((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  BF (R = Me  3  Si  1  , t  Bu  2  , C  6  F  5  3,  o&#8208;tol  4  , Mes  5  , Dipp  6  ) and borinium salts [((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  B][B(C  6  F  5  )  4  ] (R = Me  3  Si  7  ,  t  Bu  8  ) are prepared and fully characterized. Compound  7  is shown to react with phosphines to generate [R  3  PSiMe  3  ]  +  and [R  3  PH]  +  (R = Me,  t  Bu). Efforts to generate related borinium cations via fluoride abstraction from ((R(Me  3  Si)N)  2  BF (R = C  6  F  5  3,  o&#8208;tol  4  , Mes  5  ) gave complex mixtures suggesting multiple reaction pathways. However for R = Dipp  6,  the species [(m&#8208;F)(SiMe  2  N(dipp))  2  BMe][B(C  6  F  5  )  4  ] was isolated as the major product, indicating methyl abstraction from silicon and F/Me exchange on boron. These observations together with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT mechanistic studies reveal that the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituents do not behave as ancillary subsitutents but rather act as sources of proton, SiMe  3  and methyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Desymmetrization of Simple Dicarboxylates via Branch&#8208;Selective Pd/Cu Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric desymmetrization has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for building stereocenters in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a Pd/Cu catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization reaction with a simple geminal dicarboxylate is reported. A wide scope of imino esters bearing an aryl or heteroaromatic group were compatible with this bimetallic catalytic system. The reactions proceeded smoothly, giving the desired products in good yields with high to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity (up to 20:1 B:L, &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99% ee). Notably, the reaction favored branched selectivity, which is unusual for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. In addition, the standard product could be easily transformed to other valuable molecules such as chiral allylic alcohols, carbamates, and organic boron compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explain the origin of the branched selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Photovoltaics for Artificial Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites have encountered a growing interest as light&#8208;absorbing materials for harvesting and recycling ambient light. This interest comes from distinct and impressive intrinsic properties of these materials and is necessitated by the need for reliable and sustainable power supplies for wearable and portable internet of things (IoT) applications. Perovskite artificial light cells (PALCs; i.e., indoor perovskite photovoltaics) have been intensively explored, and thus their device performance has been rapidly augmented. In this review, we summarize and consolidate the research outputs of PALCs by focusing on the tuning of photo&#8208;absorber and interlayer materials for efficient harvest and collection of artificial light sources. We also emphasize various challenges and possible future research directions that should be addressed for realizing a large market uptake of PALCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced donor state destabilisation &#8211; a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intense absorption of light to covering a large part of the visible spectrum is highly desirable for solar energy conversion schemes. To this end, we have developed novel anionic bis(4  H  &#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes (cuprates), which feature intense, panchromatic light absorption properties throughout the visible spectrum and into the NIR region with extinction coefficients up to 28,000&#160;M  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;1  . Steady&#8208;state absorption, (spectro)electrochemical and theoretical investigations reveal low energy (Vis to NIR) metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption bands, which are a consequence of destabilized copper&#8208;based donor states. These high&#8208;lying copper&#8208;based states are induced by the &#963;&#8208;donation of the chelating anionic ligands, which also feature low energy acceptor states. The optical properties are reflected in very low, copper&#8208;based oxidation potentials and three ligand&#8208;based reduction events. These electronic features reveal a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we disclose cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) as a one&#8208;electron reductant under the formation of a transient radical cation as indicated by EPR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the disclosed CAAC reducing reactivity was utilized for the synthesis of acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids. The results demonstrate the CAAC to be a potent organic reductant. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin&#8217;s hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Sigma/pi Bonding Preferences of Solvated Alkali&#8208;Metal Cations to Ditopic Arylmethyl Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selection of diarylmethanes have been deprotonated at the bridgehead by alkali&#8208;metal bases and then trapped as monomers with polydentate N&#8208;donors to probe the different sigma/pi preferences of the resulting potentially ditopic anions towards the Li, Na or K cations. X&#8208;ray crystallography, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have been employed to interrogate the nature of these interactions across all three phases.







Abstract
Arylmethyl anions allow alkali&#8208;metals to bind in a &#963;&#8208;fashion to the lateral carbanionic centre or a &#960;&#8208;fashion to the aryl ring or in between these extremities, with the trend towards &#960; bonding increasing on descending group 1. Here we review known alkali metal structures of diphenylmethane, fluorene, 2&#8208;benzylpyridine and 4&#8208;benzylpyridine. Next, we synthesise Li, Na, K monomers of these diarylmethyls using polydentate donors PMDETA or Me6TREN to remove competing oligomerizing interactions, studying the effect that two aromatic rings has on negative charge (de)localisation via NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT studies. Diphenylmethyl and fluorenyl anions maintain C(H)&#8722;M interactions regardless of alkali&#8208;metal, although the adjacent arene carbons engage in interactions with larger alkali&#8208;metals. Introducing a nitrogen atom into the ring (at the 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;position) encourages relocalisation of negative charge away from the deprotonated carbon and onto nitrogen. Phenyl(2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl moves from an enamide formation at one extremity (lithium) to an aza&#8208;allyl formation at the other extremity (potassium), while C&#8208; or N&#8208;coordination modes become energetically viable for Na and K phenyl(4&#8208;pyridyl)methyl complexes.

         <title>Deciphering Internal and External &#960;&#8208;Conjugation in C3&#8208;Symmetric Multiple Azobenzene Connected Systems in Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tripodal C3&#8208;symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems are reported that have extended conjugation at external and internal positions. The influence of the extended &#960;&#8208;bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.







Abstract
Two tripodal C3&#8208;symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems T1 and T2 are reported that have extended conjugation at external and internal positions using an acryl group. The influence of the extended &#960;&#8208;bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. In particular, the investigations on the self&#8208;assembly have been carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polarized optical microscopy (POM), X&#8208;ray diffraction studies (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the behaviour of the two target molecules in supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.

&lt;p&gt;Two tripodal &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric photoswitchable molecular systems &lt;b&gt;T1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;T2&lt;/b&gt; are reported that have extended conjugation at external and internal positions using an acryl group. The influence of the extended &#960;-bonds in their absorption properties, thermal relaxation of the photoisomers and their propensities in forming supramolecular self-assemblies have been explored through spectroscopy, and microscopic studies. In particular, the investigations on the self-assembly have been carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polarized optical microscopy (POM), X-ray diffraction studies (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Remarkably, the position of the acryl group influences the behaviour of the two target molecules in supramolecular assembly, and also in the formation of photoresponsive organic hydrogels or microcrystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid and High&#8208;Throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Detection without RNA Extraction and Amplification by Using a Microfluidic Biochip</title>

Rapid, ultrasensitive, extraction&#8208;free and amplification&#8208;free strategy for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) RNA using a microfluidic biochip that exhibits an ultralow detection limit (600&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1) and the ability to simultaneously evaluate 15&#8197;RNA samples within 40&#8197;min. The proposed RNA detection strategy has prospective applications in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and COVID&#8208;19 (Corona virus disease 2019) patient diagnosis.







Abstract
The ongoing outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has spread globally and poses a threat to public health and National economic development. Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without the need of RNA extraction and amplification remain a key challenge. In this study, a new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy using a microfluidic biochip for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 without RNA extraction and amplification was developed. This new strategy takes advantage of the specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA and probe DNA reaction in the microfluidic channel, fluorescence signal regulation by nanomaterials, and accurate sample control by the microfluidic chip. It presents an ultralow limit of detection of 600 copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in a large linear detection regime from 1 aM to 100&#8197;fM. Fifteen samples were simultaneously detected in 40&#8197;min without the need for RNA purification and amplification. The detection accuracy of the strategy was validated through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#8208;PCR), with a recovery of 99&#8211;113&#8201;%. Therefore, the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy proposed in this study can potentially be used for the quantitative diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.

         <title>A Combined Spectroscopic and Theoretical Study on a Ruthenium Complex Featuring a &#960;&#8208;Extended dppz Ligand for Light&#8208;Driven Accumulation of Multiple Reducing Equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of a charge&#8208;photoaccumulating ruthenium complex are deciphered by mean of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory. This study sheds light on the decisive role played by the pyridoquinolinone subunit of the &#960;&#8208;extended dppz ligand in the photoinduced processes.







Abstract
The design of photoactive systems capable of storing and relaying multiple electrons is highly demanded in the field of artificial photosynthesis, where transformations of interest rely on multielectronic redox processes. The photophysical properties of the ruthenium photosensitizer [(bpy)2Ru(oxim&#8208;dppqp)]2+ (Ru), storing two electrons coupled to two protons on the &#960;&#8208;extended oxim&#8208;dppqp ligand under light&#8208;driven conditions, are investigated by means of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman and transient absorption spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory; the results are discussed in comparison to the parent [(bpy)2Ru(dppz)]2+ and [(bpy)2Ru(oxo&#8208;dppqp)]2+ complexes. In addition, this study provides in&#8208;depth insights on the impact of protonation or of accumulation of multiple reducing equivalents on the reactive excited states.

         <title>Dissipative Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DDCvC) Based on the Transimination Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report that the composition of a dynamic library (DL) of interconverting imines can be controlled over the time in a dissipative fashion by the addition of an activated carboxylic acid used as a chemical fuel. When the fuel is added to the DL, which is initially under thermodynamic equilibrium, the composition of the mixture dramatically changes and a new, dissipative (out of equilibrium) state is reached that persists until fuel exhaustion. Thus, a transient dissipative dynamic library (DDL) is generated that, eventually, reverts back to the initial DL when the fuel is consumed, closing a DL&#8594;DDL&#8594;DL cycle. The larger the amount of added fuel, the longer the time spent by the system in the DDL state. The transimination reaction is shown to be an optimal candidate for the realization of a dissipative dynamic covalent chemistry (DDCvC).</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination and Hydroboration of Ru(II)&#8208;Borate Complexes: Dihydridoborate vs. Bis(dihydridoborate)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 18&#8208;electron pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate and bis(dihydridoborate) complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterised. Isolation of Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complexes permitted hydroboration reactions with [HC&#8801;C(CO2Me)] that unusually led to the formation of &#951;4&#8208;&#963;,&#960;&#8208;alkene&#8208;borane complexes via both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov additions.







Abstract
Treatment of [Cp*RuCl2]2, 1, [(COD)IrCl]2, 2 or [(p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2]2, 3 (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5, COD= 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and p&#8208;cymene=&#951;6&#8208;iPrC6H4Me) with heterocyclic borate ligands [Na[(H3B)L], L1 and L2 (L1: L=amt, L2: L=mp; amt=2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole, mp=2&#8208;mercaptopyridine) led to the formation of borate complexes having uncommon coordination. For example, complexes 1 and 2 on reaction with L1 and L2 afforded dihydridoborate species [LAM(&#956;&#8208;H)2BHL] 4&#8211;6 (4: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=amt; 5: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=mp; 6: LA=COD, M=Ir, L=mp). On the other hand, treatment of 3 with L2 yielded cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}2], cis&#8208;7 and trans&#8208;7. The isolation and structural characterization of fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}{(&#956;&#8208;H)BH(mp)2}], 8 from the same reaction offered an insight into the behaviour of these dihydridoborate species in solution. Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at cis&#8208;and trans&#8208;7, they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition products, 10&#8201;a&#8211;d.

&lt;/b&gt; yielded &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH(mp)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;.

Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition products, &lt;b&gt;10&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polycations Stabilized by Borosulfates: [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and the One Dimensional Metal [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(SO4)&#8208;rich silicate analogue borosulfates are able to stabilize cationic cluster&#8208;like and chain&#8208;like aggregates. Single crystals of [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) are obtained via a solvothermal reaction with SO3 and the electronic properties are investigated by means of density functional theory based calculations. [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] exhibits a cluster&#8208;like cation and the cationic gold&#8208;chloride strands in [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) are found to resemble one&#8208;dimensional metallic wires, further confirmed by polarization microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>The varied Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity of the Germylene Phosphaketene (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO 1 is shown to react with the Lewis acids (E(C6F5)3 E = B, Al). Nonetheless, 1 participates in FLP chemistry with electron deficient alkynes or olefins, acting as an intramolecular FLP. In contrast, in the presence of B(C6F5)3 and an electron rich alkyne, 1 behaves as Ge&#8208;based nucleophile to effect intermolecular FLP addition to the alkyne. This reactivity demonstrates that the reaction pathway is controlled by the nature of the electrophile and nucleophile generated in solution, as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Enhancement of Single Molecular Conductance of Molecular Wire by a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comparison of single molecular conductance between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated wires with and without radical substituent was performed. Specifically, methyl&#8208; and iminonitroxide&#8208;substituted 4&#8208;(biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine wires bound onto porphyrin template were subjected to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) apparent height measurement at the interface between highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and 1&#8208;octanoic acid. Statistical analysis of STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has 3.2&#177;1.7 times larger conductance than the methyl&#8208;substituted reference. Although density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that only 17% of the SOMO is distributed on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve the high conductivity of molecular wires.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Thin Films Enabled by CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) Precursor Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are candidates for lighting and display materials due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, the dissolution issue of perovskite nanocrystals in polar solvents remains a challenge for practical applications. Herein, we present a newly&#8208;designed one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating strategy to prepare a novel multicolor&#8208;tunable CsPbX3  (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocrystal film, where the CsPbX3  precursor solution was formed by dissolving PbO, Cs2CO3,  and CH3NH3X into the ionic liquid n&#8208;butylammonium butyrate. The as&#8208;designed CsPbX3  nanocrystal films show high color purity with a narrow emission width. Also, the blue CsPb(Cl/Br)3  film demonstrates the absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 15.6%, which is higher than 11.7% of green CsPbBr3  and 8.3% of red CsPb(Br/I)3  film. This study develops an effective approach to preparing CsPbX3  nanocrystal thin films, opening a new avenue to design perovskite nanocrystals&#8208;based devices for lighting and display applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites, with their novel functionalities and structural diversity, are a perfect platform for emerging optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, lightemitting diodes, and solar cells. For the first time, we studied the synthesis and characterization of mixed&#8208;cation copper perovskite crystals including (Cs, caesium/MA, methyl ammonium). Interestingly, unlike mixed&#8208;cation lead perovskites, which demonstrate bimodal band gap behavior, mixed&#8208;cation copper perovskites demonstrate trimodal band gap behavior, as proven by X&#8208;Ray Diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. In comparison to all Cs perovskite, which has antiferromagnetic properties, all MA and mixed&#8208;cation perovskites demonstrate ferromagnetic behavior. According to optical measurements, mixed&#8208;cation perovskite has the lowest band gap (1.53 eV) of all MA and all Cs perovskites. In comparison to all MA and all Cs perovskites, the mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cell exhibits the lowest Voc losses. These findings demonstrate the importance of cation&#8208;engineering in developing innovative materials with novel properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the biosynthetic capacity of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Enzyme Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to  sp2  &#8208; and  sp3  &#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non-radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C-H bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of heterocycle annelation on NIR absorbance in quinoid thioacene derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a homologous series of quinoid sulfur&#8208;containing imidazolyl&#8208;substituted heteroacenes is described. The optoelectronic and magnetic properties were investigated by UV/vis, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations and were compared to the corresponding benzo congener. The room&#8208;temperature and atmosphere&#8208;stable quinoids display strong absorption in the NIR region between 678&#8211;819 nm. The dithieno[3,2&#8208;  b  :2',3'&#8208;  d  ]thiophene derivative and the thieno[2',3':4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;  b  ]thieno[2,3&#8208;  d  ]thiophene derivative were EPR active at room temperature. For the latter, variable temperature EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a thermally accessible triplet state, with a singlettriplet separation of 14.1 kJ/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and photoinduced electron transfer in porphyrin&#8208; and phthalocyanine&#8208; bearing N&#8208;doped graphene hybrids synthesized via click chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen, boron, and phosphorous by replacing some of the skeletal carbon atoms is emerging as an important class of two&#8208;dimensional materials as it offers the much&#8208;needed bandgap for optoelectronic applications and provides better access for chemical functionalization at the hetero&#8208;atom sites. Covalent grafting of photosensitizers onto such doped graphenes makes them highly useful for light&#8208;induced applications.&#160; Herein, we report the covalent functionalization of N&#8208;doped graphene (NG) with two well&#8208;known electron donor photosensitizers, namely, zinc porphyrin (ZnP) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), using the simple  click  chemistry approach.  Covalent attachment of ZnP and ZnPc at the N&#8208;sites of NG in NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed using a range of spectroscopic, thermogravimetric, and imaging techniques.  Ground and excited&#8208;state interactions in  NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc were  monitored using spectral and electrochemical techniques. Efficient quenching of photosensitizer fluorescence in these hybrids was observed, and the relatively easier oxidations of ZnP and ZnPc supported excited&#8208;state charge&#8208;separation events. Photoinduced charge separation in NG&#8208;ZnP and NG&#8208;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed using the ultrafast pump&#8208;probe technique. The measured rate constants were of the order of 10  10  s,  &#8208;1  thus indicating ultrafast electron transfer phenomena.</dc:description>
