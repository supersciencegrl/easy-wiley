         <title>How to look for compounds: predictive screening and in situ studies in Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we demonstrate the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8208;situ diffraction studies as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system, such an approach led to 4 novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P&#8208;1) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1:1:1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm&#8208;3m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611 K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5 GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr  2  Si  2  structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these  I  4  /mmm  symmetry MH  4  compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH  4  , ScH  4  and ZrH  4  reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH  4  , modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms were also key contributors, and softened substantially at lower pressures.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Tri/Difluoromethyl Ketones from Carboxylic Acids via Cross&#8208;Coupling with Acyloxyphosphonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and straightforward approach for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl ketones from widely available carboxylic acids is disclosed. The transformation utilizes an acyloxyphosphonium ion as the active electrophile, conveniently generated in situ from the carboxylic acid substrate using commodity chemicals. The utility of the reaction system is exemplified by its chemoselectivity, with tolerance to a variety of important functional groups. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of carboxylic acid APIs and pharmaceutically relevant compounds is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metalacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metalacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong  &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak  &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8208;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th  century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As&#160;covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8208; May, 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as the transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnesium Deintercalation From the Spinel&#8208;Type MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 (0.4&#8804;y&#8804;2.0) by Acid&#8208;Treatment and Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12599-12609, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured MgxMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 with cubic spinel structures are studied. According to the DFT calculations, the intermediate compositions can be stable, and the voltage could be tailored with the composition. Partial replacement of Mn by Fe could improve the electrochemical cyclability, whereas the Fe would also induce a disorder of the spinel structure, thereby reducing the electrode capacity. The reactions for the acid&#8208;treatment are different for MgMn2O4 and MgFe2O4. The intermediate composition with low iron&#8208;content and acid&#8208;treatment exhibits a good electrochemical behavior.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries attract lots of attention because of their high safety and low cost compared to lithium batteries, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn2O4 is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4. The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn3+ (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe3+ (non&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.

Graphdyine nanosheets were synthesized successfully by employing cross&#8208;coupling method with CuI as the catalyst and the composite copper iodide&#8208;graphdyine (CuI&#8208;GD) composite was coupled with the flower&#8208;like layered double hydroxide (NiAl&#8208;LDH) to construct an S&#8208;scheme for producing H2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The spherical flower&#8208;like NiAl&#8208;LDH can support CuI&#8208;GD to prevent it from aggregation. A greatly improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance was obtained in the sensitized system.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (g&#8722;CnH2n&#8208;2), a novel two&#8208;dimension carbon allotrope material composed of a sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybrid carbon network, has been widely explored since it was synthesized for the first time by Li's group in 2010. A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields. Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu+ contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI&#8208;GD is coupled with flower&#8208;like NiAl&#8208;LDH to produce H2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing a cross&#8208;coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH has a 15&#8208; and 216&#8208;fold enhancement compared with CuI&#8208;GD and NiAl&#8208;LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process was proposed to understand the interaction among these materials.

Location, location, dimension: A pyridine&#8208;based amphiphile complexed with 1,5&#8208;, 1,6&#8208;, 2,6&#8208;, or 2,7&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene self&#8208;assembled in water to form supramolecular nanotubes in which the dihydroxy naphthalene components formed J&#8208;type aggregates. The inner diameter (ID) of the nanotubes strongly depended on the regioisomeric dihydroxy naphthalene.







Abstract
A pyridine&#8208;based amphiphile complexed with 1,5&#8208;, 1,6&#8208;, 2,6&#8208;, or 2,7&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene self&#8208;assembled in water to form nanotubes with inner diameters of 46, 38, 24, 18, and 11&#8197;nm in which the naphthalene molecules formed J&#8208;type aggregates. In contrast, the amphiphile complexed with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, 1,7&#8208;, 1,8&#8208;, or 2,3&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene formed nanofibers in which the naphthalene molecules formed H&#8208;type aggregates. The inner diameter of the nanotubes strongly depended on the regioisomeric dihydroxy naphthalene. UV&#8211;vis, fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that nanotubes with smaller inner diameters had weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the tilted amphiphiles complexed with the naphthalene molecules within the membrane walls and showed larger Stokes shifts in the excimer fluorescence of the naphthalene moiety. These findings should be useful not only for fine&#8208;tuning the inner diameters of supramolecular nanotubes but also for controlling the aggregation states of functional aromatic molecules to generate nanostructures with useful optical and electronic properties in water.

         <title>Janus Pyrrolopyrrole Aza&#8208;dipyrrin: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Assemblies and Slow Magnetic Relaxation of the Cobalt(II) Complex in the Solid State</title>

Look both ways after crossing: A pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin with a Janus duality (Janus&#8208;PPAD) resulting from the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole and azaarylamine. In addition to the self&#8208;complementary assembly, the cobalt complex functions as a single&#8208;molecule magnet in the presence of a static magnetic field.







Abstract
A novel pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin (Janus&#8208;PPAD) with Janus duality was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole. The orthogonal interactions of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties in Janus&#8208;PPAD enabled the metal ions to be arranged at regular intervals: zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination provided metal&#8208;coordinated Janus&#8208;PPAD dimers, which can subsequently form hydrogen&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional arrays both in solution and in the solid state. The supramolecular assembly of the zinc(II) complex in solution was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on the isodesmic model, in which a binding constant for the elongation of assemblies is constant. Owing to the tetrahedral coordination, in the solid state, the cobalt(II) complex exhibited a slow magnetic relaxation due to the negative D value of &#8722;27.1&#8197;cm&#8722;1 with an effective relaxation energy barrier Ueff of 38.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The effect of magnetic dilution on the relaxation behavior is discussed. The relaxation mechanism at low temperature was analyzed by considering spin lattice interactions and quantum tunneling effects. The easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy was confirmed, and the relevant wave functions were obtained by ab initio CASSCF calculations.

         <title>How to Prepare Kinetically Stable Self&#8208;assembled Pt12L24 Nanocages while Circumventing Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12667-12674, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Avoiding the unwanted: Robust Pt12L24 assemblies were selectively formed by a combination of thermodynamic tuning, achieved by rigidifying the ligands, and kinetic tuning with catalytic amounts of additives. The described methodology can be applied to prepare a variety of functionalised platinum assemblies that were shown to be kinetically stable against biologically and catalytically relevant substrates.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanostructures have been widely studied, and currently various applications are being explored. For several applications, the stability of the nanostructure is of key importance, and this strongly depends on the metal used in the self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, design strategies and synthetic protocols to access desirable kinetically stable Pt12L24 nanospheres are reported, and it is demonstrated that these are stable under conditions under which the palladium counterparts decompose. Descriptors previously used for palladium nanospheres are insufficient for platinum analogues, as the stronger metal&#8211;ligand bond results in a mixture of kinetically trapped structures. We report that next to the dihedral angle, the rigidity of the ditopic ligand is also a key parameter for the controlled formation of Pt12L24 nanospheres. Catalytic amounts of coordinating additives to labilise the platinum&#8208;pyridyl bond to some extent are needed to selectively form Pt12L24 assemblies. The formed Pt12L24 nanospheres were demonstrated to be stable in the presence of chloride, amines and acids, unlike the palladium analogues.

         <title>Engineered Cyclotides with Potent Broad in Vitro and in Vivo Antimicrobial Activity</title>

The cyclotide is turning: By using a topologically modified sequence of protegrin PG&#8208;1, novel cyclotides were engineered with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed little hemolytic activity and was extremely stable in serum. In addition, this cyclotide was able to provide protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine P. aeruginosa&#8208;induced peritonitis model.







Abstract
The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to the rapid development of drug resistance to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates is reported. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity, and provided protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.

A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was realized by using N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine as a catalyst under UV light irradiation. This reaction does not necessitate aliphatic amine additives as sacrificial reductants. The mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays a critical role as a hydrogen and electron donor for this photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was achieved by using N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenediamine (1) as a strong photoreduction catalyst. This reaction was applicable not only to electron&#8208;rich monofluoroarenes but also to polyfluoroarenes to afford non&#8208;fluorinated arenes. The experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays an important role for regeneration of the photocatalyst, enabling additive&#8208;free photoreduction catalysis.

Stopping diodes from dying: A TADF exciplex host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to improve the efficiency and device lifetime of blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A higher external quantum efficiency of over 20&#8201;% and doubled device lifetime with deep blue color coordinate were realized in the blue phosphorescent OLEDs by using the new exciplex host system.







Abstract
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type exciplex host employing a novel electron&#8208;transport type (n&#8208;type) type host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN&#8208;modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF&#8208;type exciplex host&#8208;based blue PhOLEDs showed high (above 20&#8201;%) quantum efficiency with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex&#8208;free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach a long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12558-12565, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed in&#8197;situ investigation of the mechanosynthesis of the hexagonal ZnS modification (wurtzite) from its elements combining synchrotron powder diffraction and pressure measurements is presented. In addition, the subsequent phase transition from the hexagonal to the cubic structure (sphalerite) was investigated and the kinetics was explored.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S8 results in the sublimation of S8, observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133&#8197;K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.

         <title>Labeling and Probing the Silica Surface Using Mechanochemistry and 17O&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12574-12588, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast, user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment approach by ball milling was developed to selectively enrich the surface of fumed silica. A variety of high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state 17O&#8197;NMR experiments (ultra&#8208;high magnetic field (35.2&#8197;T), 17O&#8197;MQMAS, 2D&#8197;17O&#8722;1H&#8197;D&#8208;HMQC, 17O&#8197;DNP), demonstrate that siloxane and different silanol bonds present at the surface, including H&#8208;bonded and isolated silanols, can be labeled and characterized in detail.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost&#8208;efficient, fast, and user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment protocols to help to understand the structure and reactivity of materials by using 17O&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15&#8197;min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5&#8201;%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High&#8208;precision 17O compositions were measured at different milling times by using large&#8208;geometry secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (LG&#8208;SIMS). High&#8208;resolution 17O&#8197;NMR analyses (including at 35.2&#8197;T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si) and silanols (Si&#8722;OH), while DNP analyses, performed by using direct 17O polarization and indirect 17O{1H}&#8197;CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8722;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D 1H&#8722;17O D&#8208;HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface&#8208;labeled silica was reacted with titania and using 17O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8722;O&#8722;Ti bonds identified.

A variety of high-resolution solid-state &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8197;NMR experiments (ultra-high magnetic field (35.2&#8197;T), &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8197;MQMAS, 2D&#8197;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8722;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;D-HMQC, &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8197;DNP), demonstrate that siloxane and different silanol bonds present at the surface, including H-bonded and isolated silanols, can be labeled and characterized in detail.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost-efficient, fast, and user-friendly &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O enrichment protocols to help to understand the structure and reactivity of materials by using &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15&#8197;min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5&#8201;%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High-precision &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O compositions were measured at different milling times by using large-geometry secondary-ion mass spectrometry (LG-SIMS). High-resolution &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8197;NMR analyses (including at 35.2&#8197;T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si) and silanols (Si&#8722;OH), while DNP analyses, performed by using direct &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O polarization and indirect &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O{&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H}&#8197;CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8722;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8722;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O D-HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface-labeled silica was reacted with titania and using &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8722;O&#8722;Ti bonds identified.&lt;/p&gt;

Controlled uptake and release: We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;spiropyran tetra&#8208;urea calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole derivatives. The acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the switches was coupled to the homo&#8208;dimeric calix[4]arene capsule's disassembly and the release of the cationic guest to the bulk solution. The neutralization of the acidified solution with Et3N completely restored the original encapsulation complex.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of unprecedented tetra&#8208;urea derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole containing four spiropyran (SP) units at their upper rim. We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;ureas derivatives using UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopies. At micromolar concentration, irradiation of the samples with 365&#8197;nm light induces changes in their absorption spectra that are consistent with SP&#8594;merocyanine (MC) isomerization. However, analogous experiments at millimolar concentration do not produce noticeable changes in the 1H NMR spectra. The addition of triflic acid to micromolar and millimolar solutions of the tetra&#8208;ureas produces the quantitative isomerization of the SP units to the protonated merocyanine form (E&#8208;MCH+) and the simultaneous disassembly of the capsular dimers to form ill&#8208;defined aggregates. The neutralization of the acid solutions resets the SP form. Under these acid/base treatment conditions, the controlled release of the included guest and the reassembly of the all&#8208;SP tetra&#8208;urea dimers occurs at different extents depending on its calix[4]arene or calix[4]pyrrole scaffold.

         <title>Trapping of Terminal Platinapolyynes by Copper(I) Catalyzed Click Cycloadditions; Probes of Labile Intermediates in Syntheses of Complexes with Extended sp Carbon Chains, and Crystallographic Studies</title>

The title reactions are, by analogy to a coal miner&#8216;s canary, employed to detect unstable transient species LyPt(C&#8801;C)nH with n up to 9. These are valuable building blocks for still longer polyynes, and all of the precursors LyPt(C&#8801;C)nSiR3 and trapping products can be crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
The silylated hexatriynyl complex trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)3SiEt3 (PtC6TES) is converted in&#8197;situ to PtC6H (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) and cross coupled with the diyne H(C&#8801;C)2SiEt3 (HC4TES; CuCl/TMEDA, O2) to give PtC10TES (71&#8201;%). This sequence is repeated twice to afford PtC14TES (65&#8201;%) and then PtC18TES (27&#8201;%). An analogous series of reactions starting with PtC8TES gives PtC12TES (60&#8201;%), then PtC16TES (43&#8201;%), and then PtC20TES (17&#8201;%). Similar cross couplings with H(C&#8801;C)2Si(i&#8208;Pr)3 (HC4TIPS) give PtC12TIPS (68&#8201;%), PtC14TIPS (68&#8201;%), and PtC16TIPS (34&#8201;%). The trialkylsilyl species (up to PtC18TES) are converted to 3+2 &#8220;click&#8221; cycloadducts or 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)n&#8208;1C=CHN(CH2C6H5)N=N (29&#8211;92&#8201;% after workups). The most general procedure involves generating the terminal polyynes PtCxH (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) in the presence of benzyl azide in DMF and aqueous CuSO4/ascorbic acid. All of the preceding complexes are crystallographically characterized and the structural and spectroscopic properties analyzed as a function of chain length. Two pseudopolymorphs of PtC20TES are obtained, both of which feature molecules with parallel sp carbon chains in a pairwise head/tail packing motif with extensive sp/sp van der Waals contacts.

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>

Spot on: A light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposome simultaneously loads a water&#8208;soluble drug (Dox) and photothermal transduction agents (ICG), targets the tumor site, and locally heats it up under external laser irradiation. Due to the conformational transformation of CP lipids, the anticancer drug Dox is released at a specific time and in a specific space to kill tumor cells. This brings about a combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy for the noninvasive treatment of tumors.







Abstract
Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new&#8208;generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide a more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which can lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes were developed for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus inducing thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. That Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited a significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo is also demonstrated, thus it can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control the activation of cytotoxicity at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.

ICG can effectively convert light energy into selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus inducing thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. That Lip-cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited a significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo is also demonstrated, thus it can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control the activation of cytotoxicity at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>

Sodium alkoxide with a pinch of salt: The in&#8197;situ release of organic or inorganic anions from silyl compounds allows for their encapsulation in a sodium alkoxide shell. These spherical mixed aggregates incorporate anions ranging from the organic and basic methyl anion, halides, and pseudo&#8208;halides to the nitrate anion. In this form, such anions can be studied as isolated entities unaffected by the influence of strongly coordinating solvents.







Abstract
Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et&#8197;al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert&#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert&#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.

         <title>Humins with Efficient Electromagnetic Wave Absorption: A By&#8208;Product of Furfural Conversion to Isopropyl Levulinate via a Tandem Catalytic Reaction in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12659-12666, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The by&#8208;product (called humins) is accompanied by a one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion reaction of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL), which is carbonized (Humins&#8208;700) and applied to a new experiment of electromagnetic wave absorption, showing superior electromagnetic wave absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm. This provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption.







Abstract
Both one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL) and carbonization of by&#8208;product (humins) for electromagnetic wave absorption are discussed, which provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption. In the former, phosphotungstic acid (PW) is employed as a homogeneous catalyst to convert FAL to PL via a tandem reaction in one pot, with the formation of a vast amount of humins. With FAL and various intermediates as substrates, it was found that humins was a polymerization product of FAL, furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and furfuryl ester (FE) with furan rings. In addition, the in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectra also provided a basis for the proposed reaction route. In the latter, with the humins as raw material, P species and WO3 doped nano&#8208;porous carbon (Humins&#8208;700) platform formed after high&#8208;temperature annealing is used for electromagnetic wave absorption and manifests desirable absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 4.5 GHz (11.2&#8211;5.7 GHz).

A versatile approach towards 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzoperylenes (DDPs) and related 2,9&#8208;dimethyldibenzoperylenes (DBPs) with various C, O, and N substituents in 1,3,8,10&#8208;positions is presented. It comprises reductive aromatization of PTCDI via O&#8208;silylation and O&#8208;trifylation steps. DDP&#8208;tetratriflate is the strategic key to (hetero)aryl, alkynyl, aminyl or O&#8208;phosphanyl DDPs characterized by UV/Vis/PL spectra, XRD and CV methods and (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DDP 3&#8201;a) and corresponding 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DBP 3&#8201;b) has been developed at multigram scale via reduction of one of the industrially most important high&#8208;performance dyes, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), and of the corresponding dihydroxy peropyrenequinone precursor. The focus of this paper is on the reactivity pattern of 3&#8201;a as key intermediate towards highly functionalized 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzopyrelenes (DDPs) obtained via catalytic substitution of four triflate by aryl, heteroaryl, alkynyl, aminyl, and O&#8208;phosphanyl substituents. The influence of electron&#8208;donating substituents (OSiMe3, OPt&#8208;Bu2, N&#8208;piperidinyl), electron&#8208;withdrawing (OTf, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;phenyl), and of electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated (2&#8208;thienyl, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, trimethylsilyl&#8208;ethynyl) substituents on optoelectronic and structural properties of these functionalized DDPs has been investigated via XRD analyses, UV/Vis, PL spectroscopy, and by electroanalytical CV. These results were correlated to results of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Thus, functionalized DPPs with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies and gap became available via a new and reliable synthetic strategy starting from readily available PTCDI.

ESKAPE kit: A novel engineered cyclotide has effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed high in vivo efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen known to produce chronic lung infection in humans. These findings suggest the possibility of designing novel therapeutics based on the cyclotide scaffold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Camarero et&#8197;al.

Supra&#8208;typed molecules composed of a pyridine&#8208;based amphiphile complexed with 1,5&#8208;, 1,6&#8208;, 2,6&#8208;, or 2,7&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene self&#8208;assemble in water to form nanotubes. The inner diameters of the nanotubes strongly depend on the naphthalene regioisomers. The excimer fluorescence bands derived from J&#8208;type aggregates of the naphthalene in the nanotubes vary according to the different inner diameters. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Kameta and M. Kogiso (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101354).

The mechanism of the mechanochemical synthesis of cubic ZnS from its elements via ball milling was studied by in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments coupled with gas pressure measurements inside the milling vessel. The combination of both techniques reveals a heterogeneous reaction mechanism including gaseous sulfur and solid zinc. Moreover, the reaction kinetics of the phase transition from cubic to hexagonal ZnS was determined from the in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101260).

Abstract
Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In particular, inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels-Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds. In particular, inverse-electron-demand hetero-Diels-Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse-electron demand hetero-Diels-Alder reaction is shown.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Decoding Directing Groups and Their Pivotal Role in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12453-12508, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of directing groups in guiding C&#8722;H activation reactions are described with a detailed picture of the various directing groups that have become prominent in carrying out functionalizations at different sites of aromatic scaffolds. The review encompasses all the relevant works that have been conducted by different groups from all over the world and this provides sufficient information for readers who wish to carry out research in this domain.







Abstract
Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8722;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo&#8208; and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways via which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8722;H activation. Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8722;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. These templates have been frequently harnessed for selectively activating C&#8722;H bonds of natural products, drugs, and macromolecules decorated with multiple C&#8722;H bonds. This itself was a challenge before the commencement of this field as functionalization of a site other than the targeted site could modify and hamper the biological activity of the pharmacophore. Total synthesis and pharmacophore development often faces the difficulty of superfluous reaction steps towards selective functionalization. This obstacle has been solved by late&#8208;stage functionalization simply by harnessing C&#8722;H bond activation. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues. Therefore, metal&#8208;free catalysts or the usage of non&#8208;toxic metals have been recently showcased in a number of elegant works. Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8722;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level. This review gives the readers a broad understanding of how these strategies work, the execution of various metal catalysts, and directing groups. This not only helps a budding scientist towards the commencement of his/her research but also helps a matured mind searching out for selective functionalization. A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope. This allows an experimental chemist to understand the applicability of this domain and employ it over any targeted substrate.

         <title>Local Light&#8208;Controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12521-12525, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local irradiation of a liquid precursor leads to the space&#8208; and time&#8208;controlled photogeneration of calcium carbonate crystals and biomorphs. The method is based on the photodecarboxylation of an organic precursor, and it was optimized to avoid precipitation of organic matter and pH changes. By tuning the light intensity, the morphology of the resulting biomorphs can be controlled.







Abstract
Photochemical activation is proposed as a general method for controlling the crystallization of sparingly soluble carbonates in space and time. The photogeneration of carbonate in an alkaline environment is achieved upon photo&#8208;decarboxylation of an organic precursor by using a conventional 365&#8197;nm UV LED. Local irradiation was conducted focusing the LED light on a 300&#8197;&#956;m radius spot on a closed glass crystallization cell. The precursor solution was optimized to avoid the precipitation of the photoreaction organic byproducts and prevent photo&#8208;induced pH changes to achieve the formation of calcium carbonate only in the corresponding irradiated area. The crystallization was monitored in real&#8208;time by time&#8208;lapse imaging. The method is also shown to work in gels. Similarly, it was also shown to photo&#8208;activate locally the formation of barium carbonate biomorphs. In the last case, the morphology of these biomimetic structures was tuned by changing the irradiation intensity.

         <title>Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Cysteine and Aminopeptidase N Using meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12545-12551, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorogenic conversion of a meso&#8208;thioester to meso&#8208;amide BODIPY dye was exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes relying on the native chemical ligation reaction mechanism. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed, and successfully applied for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively.







Abstract
meso&#8208;Carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively. The aromatic (1&#8201;a) and aliphatic (4) thioesters of meso&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte&#8208;induced conversion to the meso&#8208;amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe 1&#8201;a exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction. Probe 4 was successfully applied to the monitoring and imaging of endogenous aminopeptidase N in live cancer cells.

         <title>Effect of a &#8220;Zn Bridge&#8221; on the Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristics of Volatile Random Access Memory Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12526-12534, September 1, 2021. </description>

Committing zinc to memory: A prominent &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221; effect with extending feature could endow porphyrinated polyimide information memory materials with volatility. The electronic excitation processes and memory behavior of porphyrinated co&#8208;polyimides could be flexibly regulated by simply altering the zinc ion content in the porphyrin core. By strengthening the stability of the &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221;, the retention characteristics of porphyrinated polyimides could be precisely and successively tuned.







Abstract
Polyimide memory materials with a donor&#8211;acceptor structure based on a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next&#8208;generation information storage technology due to their outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance and good dimensional and chemical stability. Precisely controlling memory performance by limited chemical decoration is one of core challenges in this field. Most reported work mainly focuses on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for the expected memory behavior of polyimides; this takes a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we report a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8722;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in the central core of the porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8722;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance merely by altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides.

The electronic excitation processes and memory behavior of porphyrinated co-polyimides could be flexibly regulated by simply altering the zinc ion content in the porphyrin core. By strengthening the stability of the &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221;, the retention characteristics of porphyrinated polyimides could be precisely and successively tuned.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyimide memory materials with a donor&#8211;acceptor structure based on a charge-transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next-generation information storage technology due to their outstanding high-temperature resistance and good dimensional and chemical stability. Precisely controlling memory performance by limited chemical decoration is one of core challenges in this field. Most reported work mainly focuses on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for the expected memory behavior of polyimides; this takes a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we report a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8722;Zn&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in the central core of the porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of a charge-transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8722;Zn&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance merely by altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Arylation of Cyclometalated Difluorinated 2&#8208;Arylisoquinolinyl Iridium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12552-12557, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysis&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;complex was developed to incorporate diversely substituted aryl group on the ligands of neutral cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes. The regioselectivity of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation is not affected by C&#8722;Ir bond, as the reaction occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two&#8208;fluorine atoms. All post&#8208;functionalized Ir(III) exhibit red phosphorescence with moderate to good efficiency.







Abstract
The utility of C&#8722;H bond functionalization of metalated ligands for the elaboration of aryl&#8208;functionalized difluorinated&#8208;1&#8208;arylisoquinolinyl Ir(III) complexes has been explored. Bis[(3,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)isoquinolinyl](2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionato) iridium(III) undergoes Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation with aryl bromides. The reaction regioselectively occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two fluorine atoms of the difluoroaryl unit, and on both cyclometalated ligands. This post&#8208;functionalization gives a straightforward access to modified complexes in only one manipulation and allows to introduce thermally sensitive functional groups, such as trifluoromethyl, nitrile, benzoyl, or ester. The X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the diarylated complexes were investigated. Whatever the nature of the incorporated substituted aryl groups is, all obtained complexes emit red phosphorescence (622&#8211;632&#8197;nm) with similar lifetimes (1.9&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>Sodium Butylated Hydroxytoluene: A Functional Group Tolerant, Eco&#8208;Friendly Base for Solvent&#8208;Free, Pd&#8208;Catalysed Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 49, Page 12535-12539, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green amination: Sodium butylated hydroxytoluene (NaBHT) has been shown to be a highly efficient base for the solvent&#8208;free (melt) amination of a wide variety of substrates, including those containing base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups.







Abstract
NaBHT (sodium 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenolate), a strong, but hindered and lipophilic base, has been effectively paired with similarly lipophilic, high&#8208;reactivity Pd&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) catalysts to produce an ideal combination for performing solvent&#8208;free (melt) cross&#8208;coupling amination. The mild nucleophilicity of NaBHT, coupled with the anti&#8208;oxidant properties of its conjugate acid byproduct, BHT means the process seems to have no functional group incompatibilities. Highly effective coupling of base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups was observed in all cases with only 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mol percent catalyst. Comparisons using the standard base for this reaction, KOtBu, led to poor couplings or complete degradation in most applications &#8211; only NaBHT works.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted, room temperature and redox neutral direct C&#8722;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance allow the preparation of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the in situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C  5  H  6  (HCp), C  5  H  5  &#8208;Si(  i  Pr)  3  (HCp  TIPS  )] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et  2  O)Mg(Cp  R  )(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (Cp  R  = Cp (  1  ), Cp  TIPS  (  2  )). The Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(Cp  R  )  2  ] (  3  ) and [(Et  2  O)MgBr(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (  4  ). Interfering solvation and aggregation as well as ligand redistribution equilibria hamper a quantitative elucidation of thermodynamic data for the Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene. In ethereal solvents, mononuclear species [(Et  2  O)  2  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )Br] (  2&#8217;  ), [(Et  2  O)  n  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )  2  ] (  3&#8217;  ), and [(Et  2  O)  2  MgBr  2  ] (  4&#8217;  ) coexist. Larger coordination numbers can be realized with cyclic ethers like tetrahydropyran allowing crystallization of [(thp)  4  MgBr  2  ] (  5  ). The interpretation of the temperature&#8208;dependency of the Schlenk equilibrium constant in diethyl ether gives a reaction enthalpy &#916;H and reaction entropy &#916;S of &#8208;11.5 kJ mol  &#8208;1  and 60 J mol  &#8208;1  , respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Single amino&#8208;acid based self&#8208;assembled biomaterials with potent antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and development of soft biomaterials based on amino acid and short&#8208;peptide have gained much attention due to their potent biomedical applications. A slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of single amino acid in a peptide or protein sequence has a huge impact on the structure and function. Phenylalanine is one of the most studied amino acids, which contains an aromatic phenyl group connected through a flexible &#8211;CH  2  &#8208; unit. In this work, we have examined whether flexibility and aromatic functionality of phenylalanine (Phe) are important in gel formation of model gelator Fmoc&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH or not. To examine this hypothesis, we synthesized Fmoc&#8208;derivatives of three analogues unnatural amino acids including cyclohexylalanine, phenylglycine, and homophenylalanine; which are slightly varied from Phe. Interestingly, all these three new analogues formed hydrogels in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 having different gelation efficacy and kinetics. This study suggests that the presence of aromatic side&#8208;chain and flexibility are not mandatory for the gelation of the model gelator. Newly synthesized unnatural amino acid derivatives have also exhibited promising antimicrobial activity towards gram&#8208;positive bacteria by inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption. We further determined the biocompatibility of these amino acid derivatives by using a hemolysis assay on human blood cells. Overall studies described the development of single amino acid&#8208;based new injectable biomaterials with improved antimicrobial activity by the slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysics of azobenzene constrained in a UiO metal&#8208;organic framework: effects of pressure, solvation and dynamic disorder</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photophysical studies of chromophoric linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are undertaken commonly in the context of sensing applications, in search of readily observable changes of optical properties in response to external stimuli. The advantages of the MOF construct as a platform for investigating fundamental photophysical behaviour have been somewhat overlooked. The linker framework offers a unique environment in which the chromophore is geometrically constrained and its structure can be determined crystallographically, but it exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure studies enable the photophysical consequences of controlled, incremental changes in local environment or conformation to be observed and correlated with structural data. We demonstrate this approach in the present study of the  trans  &#8208;azobenzene chromophore, constrained in the form of the 4&#8217;4&#8208;azobenzenedicarboxylate (abdc) linker, in a UiO topology framework. We report previously unobserved effects of pressure&#8208;induced solvation and conformational distortion on the lowest energy, np* transition, and interpret these in the light of crystallographic data. We find that  trans  &#8208;azobenzene remains non&#8208;fluorescent (with a quantum yield less than 10  &#8208;4  ) despite the prevention of  trans&#8208;cis  isomerization by the constraining MOF structure. We propose that efficient non&#8208;radiative decay is mediated by the local, pedal&#8208;like twisting of the azo group that is evident as dynamic disorder in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Various triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes have been synthesized from Ru3(CO)12. The new complexes were tested for their ability to catalyze cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols. Their associated catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. In particular, the substrate scope of catalytic cycloadditions with 3&#8208;ketolactones or phloroglucinol derivatives is extended to terpenoid&#8208;derived propargyl alcohols containing an internal alkyne moiety. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Retention of Dynamic Chiral Arrangements for Achiral Shear Thinning Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin doctoring: Shear thinning is suggested to help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in a vortex, which results in strong CD properties. Furthermore, the introduction of a small molecule that both undergoes electrostatic interaction and possesses dual&#8208;site coordination bonding ability will greatly increase the storage modulus of colloids and make them maintain dynamic CD properties in the static state.







Abstract
Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because they are the fundamental components of living organisms, but also for their unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by using chiral physical fields, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between dynamic chiroptical properties and rheological nature is discussed, suggesting the shear thinning properties of non&#8208;Newtonian fluids might help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in vortices. Furthermore, the storage modulus of colloids could be increased by adding a linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical properties in the static state. Moreover, the salt effect on the host&#8211;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, the results suggested a significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.

Right Bipyramids. By separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow system, Pt right bipyramids containing one single twin plane were obtained in high yield.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br&#8722; ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.

         <dc:description>
Four selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted, bithiophene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;triarylboranes were synthesized and their potential biological applications were investigated including live cell imaging and photo&#8208;induced cell death. It is demonstrated that their photophysical and electrochemical properties and their interactions with DNAs, RNA and cells, are strongly influenced by the number and distribution of charges within the compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208; and trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;triarylborane bithiophene chromophores are presented along with the water solubility and singlet oxygen sensitizing efficiency of the cationic compounds Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+. Comparison with the mono&#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the bis&#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+ with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unforeseen aspects of ATI chemistry: The impact of a nitro substituent in the backbone of the aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of alkali metal (Li&#8722;K) complexes has been investigated. This includes the first examples of i) an isolable free ATI anion, ii) E/Z imine isomerisations of ATI species and iii) N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATIs.







Abstract
Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry that have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs has been little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO2 group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the N,N&#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented E/Z isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; (i.&#8201;e., without directional bonding to a metal atom) ATI anion. Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 by Activation of the Binary Nitrides ScN and TiN with NH4F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxonitridophosphates Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have been prepared by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions from the refractory nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively. These reactions were enabled by the addition of NH4F as a mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were elucidated by a combination of SCXRD, BVS calculations and magnetic measurements for Ti5P12N24O2 revealing two distinct crystallographic sites occupied by either Ti3+ or Ti4+, respectively.







Abstract
Multinary transition metal nitrides and oxonitrides are a versatile and intriguing class of compounds. However, they have been investigated far less than pure oxides. The compounds Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have now been synthesized from the binary nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively, by following a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. NH4F acts as a mineralizing agent that supports product formation and crystallization. The starting materials ScN and TiN are seemingly an uncommon choice because of their chemical inertness but, nevertheless, react under these conditions. Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 crystallize isotypically with Ti5B12O26, consisting of solely vertex&#8208;sharing P(O/N)4 tetrahedra forming two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like nets that host TM(O/N)6 (TM=Sc, Ti) octahedra. Ti5P12N24O2 is a mixed&#8208;valence compound and shows ordering of Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions.

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D on&#8208;surface assembly of isosteric phenazine derivatives was investigated by utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy on single&#8208;crystal gold, silver and copper surfaces. The strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerism were found to have a profound impact on the 2D assembly patterns, as evidenced by the variations in surface structure for the three derivative molecules used in this study.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives, DHP, DAP, and DBQD, to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While DHP exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies, DAP and DBQD show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.

While &lt;b&gt;DHP&lt;/b&gt; exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies, &lt;b&gt;DAP&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DBQD&lt;/b&gt; show either spatially confined or ill-defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>First Synthesis of the Inherently Chiral Trans&#8208;4&#8242; Bisadduct of C59N Azafullerene by Using Cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as a Tether</title>

Heterofullerene tailoring: The inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; bisadduct of azafullerene has been synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern, and 13C NMR spectroscopy showed C1 symmetry. The bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the enantiomers was probed by CD spectroscopy. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption and electrochemical data suggest that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct as compared to the equatorialface bisadduct.







Abstract
The multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C59N has been scarcely explored, and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral equatorialface bisadduct of C59N, we focused on the isolation of the first trans&#8208;4 bisadduct in a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the trans&#8208;4 bisadduct of C59N by using cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as a tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has C1 symmetry, as evidenced by 13C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; C59N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.

         <title>Diphenylalanine Motif Drives Self&#8208;Assembling in Hybrid PNA&#8208;Peptide Conjugates</title>

Forces triggering self&#8208;assembly. Conjugates of the PNA gc to the dipeptide FF assemble in water, producing fluorescent materials. Watson&#8208;Crick hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases and aromatic interactions between amino acids could stabilize the aggregate. The latter mainly drive the aggregation process.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the peptide nucleic acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.

         <title>Study of the Lithium Storage Mechanism of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Modified Cu2S Electrodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Ad LIB: In this study, thermal carbon reduction of CuS into Cu2S was monitored by high&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD). As LIB electrode material, Li+ storage intermediate Cu1.8S is confirmed by operando methods. The result shows that some original Cu2S remains unreacted after the first cycle, and carbon modification can improve the cycling stability of Cu2S for LIBs in the long&#8208;term cycle.







Abstract
Owing to their high specific capacity and abundant reserve, CuxS compounds are promising electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Carbon compositing could stabilize the CuxS structure and repress capacity fading during the electrochemical cycling, but the corresponding Li+ storage mechanism and stabilization effect should be further clarified. In this study, nanoscale Cu2S was synthesized by CuS co&#8208;precipitation and thermal reduction with polyelectrolytes. High&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction was used to monitor the thermal reduction process. During the first cycle, the conversion mechanism upon lithium storage in the Cu2S/carbon was elucidated by operando synchrotron radiation diffraction and in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;composited Cu2S (Cu2S/C) exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 425&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher, long&#8208;term capacity of 523&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles; in contrast, the bare CuS electrode exhibits 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. Multiple&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry proves that extra Li+ storage can mainly be ascribed to the contribution of the capacitive storage.

         <title>Efficient Entropy&#8208;Driven Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase III by Hydroxyethylene Transition&#8208;State Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;state&#8208;based inhibitor has been developed which efficiently inhibits the metalloprotease dipeptidylpeptidase 3 (DPP3) by releasing structured water molecules from the binding cleft.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, it could be shown that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors is reported, using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#956;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Aminomethylation of Aromatic Sulfones Promoted by Eosin Y</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free a&#8208;aminomethylation of heteroaryls promoted by eosin Y under green light irradiation is reported. A large variety of a&#8208;trimethylsilylamines as precursor of a&#8208;aminomethyl radical species were engaged to functionalize sulfonyl&#8208;heteroaryls following a Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (HAS) pathway. This method has provided a range of a&#8208;aminoheteroaryl compounds including a functionalized natural product. The mechanism of this late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryls was investigated and suggests the formation of a sulfonyl radical intermediate over a reductive quenching cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Take a &#8220;Snapshot&#8221; of New Syntheses, Reactions and Characterizations from Unusual Unsaturated Ring Strained Group 4 Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently published syntheses, reactions and characterization of unusual unsaturated ring strained Group 4 metallocene metallacycles like metalla&#8208;cyclocumulenes, &#8208;cycloallenes and &#8208;cycloalkynes with different ring size are updated  for the last three years. There exist for some of these metallacycles, depending on the ring size, 7&#8208;, 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered compounds. The new results for these metallacycles are summarized here and considered in addition to the former published results. Additionally, several compounds of this type were now characterized by new reactions. For a better understanding of these compounds, some spectroscopical methods as well as theoretical calculations were published. Despite of these  all  &#8208;C&#8208;metallacycles, only in some cases the syntheses and reactions for the corresponding  hetero  &#8208;metallacycles were published too. Examples for these metallaheterocyclic compounds will not be considered in this article. All these unusual ring strained compounds have a great potential for a lot of interesting synthetic applications in the future. Additionally, are they very interesting from the theoretical point of view.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (  2  ) and a trigonal prism (  3  ) were generated  via  using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent,  cis  &#8208;(PEt  3  )  2  Pt(OTf)  2  &#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an  ortho  &#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (  1  ), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (~13%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC).  2  , however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of ~41%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of  3  is merely ~6% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly,  3  could be fully transformed into  2  by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover,  2  tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but  3  does not show the property. Therefore, controling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared  via  organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoparticles for Triple Drug Release for Combined Chemo&#8208; and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pH&#8208;responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has been prepared for the delivery of three anticancer drugs with different modes of action. The novelty of this system is its ability to combine a synergistic chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Herein, a photoactive conjugate of a phthalocyanine (Pc) and a topoisomerase I inhibitor (topo&#8208;I), namely camptothecin (CPT), linked by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain has been synthesized and then loaded into the mesopores of MSNs. Doxorubicin (DOX), which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor (topo&#8208;II), has also been covalently anchored to the outer surface of the MSNs through a dihydrazide polyethylene glycol linker. In the acidic environment of tumor cells, selective release of the three drugs takes place.  In vitro  studies have demonstrated the endocytosis of the system into HeLa and HepG2 cells and the subsequent release of the three drugs into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of DOX, CPT and Pc has been assessed  in vitro  before and upon light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile conversion of molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes for accelerated SAR exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization via copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation reaction allowing the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labelled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as unique reservoirs for multiple electron transfers. As POMs display only weak absorption in the visible spectrum, they can be associated with chromophores such as porphyrins and porphyrin antennae. In this review, the research dedicated to the combination of porphyrins and polyoxometalates is put in context and the state of the art identifying the challenges addressed in the optimization of hybrid materials for applications is detailed. @font&#8208;face {font&#8208;family:"MS Mincho"; panose&#8208;1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; mso&#8208;font&#8208;alt:"&#65325;&#65331; &#26126;&#26397;"; mso&#8208;font&#8208;charset:128; mso&#8208;generic&#8208;font&#8208;family:roman; mso&#8208;font&#8208;format:other; mso&#8208;font&#8208;pitch:fixed; mso&#8208;font&#8208;signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;}@font&#8208;face {font&#8208;family:"Cambria Math"; panose&#8208;1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso&#8208;font&#8208;charset:1; mso&#8208;generic&#8208;font&#8208;family:roman; mso&#8208;font&#8208;pitch:variable; mso&#8208;font&#8208;signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}@font&#8208;face {font&#8208;family:"\@MS Mincho"; panose&#8208;1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; mso&#8208;font&#8208;charset:128; mso&#8208;generic&#8208;font&#8208;family:roman; mso&#8208;font&#8208;format:other; mso&#8208;font&#8208;pitch:fixed; mso&#8208;font&#8208;signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso&#8208;style&#8208;unhide:no; mso&#8208;style&#8208;qformat:yes; mso&#8208;style&#8208;parent:""; margin:0cm; margin&#8208;bottom:.0001pt; mso&#8208;pagination:widow&#8208;orphan; font&#8208;size:12.0pt; font&#8208;family:"Times New Roman",serif; mso&#8208;fareast&#8208;font&#8208;family:"MS Mincho"; mso&#8208;ansi&#8208;language:DE; mso&#8208;fareast&#8208;language:JA;}.MsoChpDefault {mso&#8208;style&#8208;type:export&#8208;only; mso&#8208;default&#8208;props:yes; font&#8208;family:"Calibri",sans&#8208;serif; mso&#8208;ascii&#8208;font&#8208;family:Calibri; mso&#8208;ascii&#8208;theme&#8208;font:minor&#8208;latin; mso&#8208;fareast&#8208;font&#8208;family:Calibri; mso&#8208;fareast&#8208;theme&#8208;font:minor&#8208;latin; mso&#8208;hansi&#8208;font&#8208;family:Calibri; mso&#8208;hansi&#8208;theme&#8208;font:minor&#8208;latin; mso&#8208;bidi&#8208;font&#8208;family:"Times New Roman"; mso&#8208;bidi&#8208;theme&#8208;font:minor&#8208;bidi; mso&#8208;fareast&#8208;language:EN&#8208;US;}.MsoPapDefault {mso&#8208;style&#8208;type:export&#8208;only; margin&#8208;bottom:8.0pt; line&#8208;height:107%;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}</dc:description>

In this review, the research dedicated to the combination of porphyrins and polyoxometalates is put in context and the state of the art identifying the challenges addressed in the optimization of hybrid materials for applications is detailed. @font-face {font-family:"MS Mincho"; panose-1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; mso-font-alt:"&#65325;&#65331; &#26126;&#26397;"; mso-font-charset:128; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;}@font-face {font-family:"Cambria Math"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:1; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}@font-face {font-family:"\@MS Mincho"; panose-1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; mso-font-charset:128; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-format:other; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:1 134676480 16 0 131072 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:""; margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman",serif; mso-fareast-font-family:"MS Mincho"; mso-ansi-language:DE; mso-fareast-language:JA;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}.MsoPapDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; margin-bottom:8.0pt; line-height:107%;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metathesis of P=C Bonds Catalyzed by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160; The catalytic metathesis of C=C bonds is a textbook reaction that has no parallel in the widely studied area of multiple bonds involving heavier p&#8208;block elements. We have discovered a high&#8208;yielding P=C bond metathesis of phosphaalkenes (ArP=CPh 2 , Ar = Mes,&#160; o &#8208;Tol, Ph) that is catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC = Me 2 IMe, Me 2 I i Pr). The products are cyclic oligomers formally derived from ArP=PAr [i.e.&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) n ; n = 3, 4, 5, 6] and Ph 2 C=CPh 2 . Preliminary mechanistic studies of this remarkable transformation have established NHC=PAr (Ar = Mes,&#160; o &#8208;Tol, Ph) as key phosphinidene transfer agents. In addition, novel cyclic intermediates, such as,&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) 2 CPh 2&#160; and&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) 4 CPh 2&#160; have also been observed.

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8208;/C&#8208;Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8208;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene&#8217;s reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8208;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes &#8211; basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple&#8217;s electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8208;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8208;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C
N Complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) coupling templated by the Au(III) cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] has been investigated. By tuning the reaction conditions and monitoring its progress by NMR, a number of intermediate species involved in the reductive elimination process could be isolated and characterised by different spectroscopic and analytical methods, including XRD, as well as by DFT studies.







Abstract
In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond &#960;&#8208;activation and to hold promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;E (E=heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] (1, CCH2N=2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained through 1D and 2D NMR analyses (1H, 13C, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC and 1H&#8208;13C HMBC) as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) CCH2N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of 1 with C(sp2)&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings at Au(III).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mechanism of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp) coupling&lt;/b&gt; templated by the Au(III) cyclometalated complex [Au(C&lt;sup&gt;CH2&lt;/sup&gt;N)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] has been investigated. By tuning the reaction conditions and monitoring its progress by NMR, a number of intermediate species involved in the reductive elimination process could be isolated and characterised by different spectroscopic and analytical methods, including XRD, as well as by DFT studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond &#960;-activation and to hold promises to achieve selective cross-couplings in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;E (E=heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross-coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)-mediated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(C&lt;sup&gt;CH2&lt;/sup&gt;N)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;CH2&lt;/sup&gt;N=2-benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained through 1D and 2D NMR analyses (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H COSY, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C HSQC and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C HMBC) as well as by HR-ESI-MS and X-ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side-products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross-coupling at the Au(III) C&lt;sup&gt;CH2&lt;/sup&gt;N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-couplings at Au(III).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different densely substituted L&#8208; and D&#8208;proline esters were prepared by asymmetric (3+2) cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by conveniently selected EhuPhos chiral ligands. The &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl pyrrolidines thus obtained in either their  endo  or  exo  forms were functionalized and coupled to yield the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. The catalytic properties of these latter dimers were examined using aldol and conjugate additions as case studies. When aldol reactions were analyzed, an additive behavior in terms of stereocontrol was observed on going from the monomers to the dimers. In contrast, in the case of the conjugate additions between ketones and nitroalkenes, the monomers did not catalyze this reaction, whereas the different &#947;&#8208;dipeptides promoted the formation of the corresponding Michael adducts. Therefore, in this latter case emergent catalytic properties were observed for these novel &#947;&#8208;dipeptides based on unnatural proline derivatives. Under certain conditions (stoichiometric amounts of ketone, acid and nitroalkene), formation of  N&#8208;  acyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxooctahydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;indoles was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for enhancing H2 evolution activity under visible light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme&#160;heterojunction photocatalyst&#160;(CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S) of CoS  2  &#160;nanospheres&#160;modified Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S solid solution&#160;was synthesized and studied. The H  2  &#160;evolution&#160;rate of composite catalyst reached 25.15 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  , which was 3.26 times that of single&#160;Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S, while pure CoS  2  &#160;showed almost no hydrogen production activity.&#160;Moreover,&#160;CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;had excellent stability, and the hydrogen production&#160;rate after six&#160;cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19%.&#160;In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments&#160;had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;was&#160;better than CoS  2  &#160;or&#160;Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;single catalyst.&#160;In this study, the synthesized CoS  2  &#160;and Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S were&#160;both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H  +  &#160;protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided&#160;a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme&#160;heterojunction&#160;in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Salicylideneaniline is a Photoswitchable Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of the first ferroelectric Rochelle salt, most ferroelectrics have been investigated showing thermally triggered symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition. Although photochromism arising from geometrical isomerization has been reported earlier in 1867, such photoswitchable ferroelectric crystals have scarcely been developed to date. Herein, we report that salicylideneaniline is a photochromic ferroelectric crystal. Upon photoirradiation, the dielectric constant shows obvious switching between high and low dielectric states, and more importantly, the ferroelectric polarization demonstrates quickly and reversibly switching. This work opens the gate of developing photoswitchable ferroelectrics, which holds great potential for applications in optically controlled smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 90 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90) are molecular chaperones that are responsible for the folding and/or trafficking of ~400 client proteins, many of which are directly associated with cancer progression. Consequently, inhibition of Hsp90 can exhibit similar activity as combination therapy as multiple signaling nodes can be targeted simultaneously. In fact, seventeen small&#8208;molecule inhibitors that bind the Hsp90 N&#8208;terminus entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, all of which exhibited pan&#8208;inhibitory activity against all four Hsp90 isoforms. Unfortunately, most demonstrated undesired effects alongside induction of the pro&#8208;survival heat shock response. As a result, isoform&#8208;selective inhibitors have been sought to overcome these detriments. Described herein is a structure&#8208;based approach to design Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors along with preliminary SAR. In the end, compound  5  was shown to manifest ~370&#8208;fold selectivity for Hsp90&#946; versus Hsp90&#945;, and induced the degradation of select Hsp90&#946;&#8208;dependent clients. These data support the development of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors as a new paradigm to overcome the detriments associated with pan&#8208;inhibition of Hsp90.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Azahelicenes and Diaza[8]circulenes through the Intramolecular Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(naphthylphenyl)&#8208;appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy&#8208;appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8211;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence. The azahepta[8]circulene was further transformed into deeply saddle&#8208;distorted dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes as the first example of its solution&#8208;based synthesis and unambiguous structural determination .</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific on&#8208;Surface Cyclodehydrogenation of Bishelicenes: Preservation of Handedness from Helical to Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flattening helices while keeping the handedness: On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of bishelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically to (M,M) and (P,P) chiral planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This is followed by their homochiral aggregation into a 2D conglomerate. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds stereospecifically to chiral, planar coronocoronene. Such a reaction is a special example of topochemistry in which enantiospecific conversion is supported by the alignment of the reactant by the surface.

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable? The activity and functional group tolerance of metal alkylidyne canopy catalysts for alkyne metathesis is excellent, but their stability leaves room for optimization. The search for the Achilles&#8242; heels unveiled a new decomposition pathway through bimolecular coupling and led to the discovery of a facile cyclo&#8208;tetramerization reaction by (reversible) opening of the tripodal ligand cage.







Abstract
Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex 1&#8201;a endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is the most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway that engages the Mo&#8801;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple&#8208;bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#8801;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex, 8, with a Mo&#8801;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques, 95Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex 6, endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework, is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining visible light and passing DC current through a carbon nitride material doped with copper atoms catalyzes the selective reduction of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to an important chemical intermediate, carbon monoxide. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to show how visible light increases the current and activity of the material. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101820).

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is one of the unresolved issues of prebiotic chemistry. Why are the amino acids found in proteins of the l configuration? Perhaps peptido nucleotides could have played a role as transitional species, as suggested visually by the Archaeopteryx in the image. It was recently shown that these phosphoramidate&#8208;linked species form spontaneously from simple precursors. Now, the diastereoselectivity of the the dipeptide&#8208;forming step has been determined by in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy, revealing that homochiral products are preferred. This is reported in the Full Paper by C. Richert et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101630).

         <title>Intramolecular C&#8722;H Amination of N&#8208;Alkylsulfamides by tert&#8208;Butyl Hypoiodite or N&#8208;Iodosuccinimide</title>

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) for the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamides is reported. The six&#8208;membered cyclic sulfamide products can be easily converted into a variety of useful 1,3&#8208;diamines. The present amination that effectively proceeds under ambient conditions, features operationally simple, practical, and scalable methodology.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diamines are an important class of compounds that are broadly found in natural products and are also widely used as building blocks in organic synthesis. Although the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamide derivatives is a reliable method for the construction of 1,3&#8208;diamine structures, the majority of these methods involve the use of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst. We herein report on a new transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS), enabling secondary non&#8208;benzylic and tertiary C&#8722;H amination reactions to proceed. The cyclic sulfamide products can be easily transformed into 1,3&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that amination reactions using t&#8208;BuOI or NIS each proceed via different pathways.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;symmetry organometallic sandwiches of lanthanides are of current high interest because of their magnetic and optical properties. When trivalent lanthanide complexes feature the large monoanionic cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligand, an interesting hapticity switching is observed along with a decrease in the size of the metal center. This cover shows the structural evolution from the terbium to the lutecium metal ion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;W. Roesky, G. Nocton, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101599).

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest applications of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with multifunctional nanomaterials in tumor treatment are summarized. Nanomaterials with different characteristics can optimize the Fenton reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction to make CDT produce distinctive enhancement effects. The combination of nanomaterials, CDT and various other therapies would promote the multi&#8208;functionalization of the treatment system, thereby enhancing the anticancer effect.







Abstract
During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to summarize the recent advances comprehensively and systematically in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.

         <title>Target&#8208;Dependent Protection of DNA Aptamers Against Nucleolytic Digestion Enables Signal&#8208;On Biosensing with Toehold&#8208;Mediated Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5 &#162; &#8208;end protects it from 3 &#162; &#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn&#8208;on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real&#8208;time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay,</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Structure of Hydrolytic Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me  3  Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensitivity of single and multiple hydrogen (H) and halogen (X) bonding to external electric fields (EEFs) was analyzed. Computations show that the variations of X&#8208;bonds mainly stem from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect governs the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference from H&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. The sensitivity in multiple&#8208;bonding cases can be regulated by the permutations of noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both ab initio valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change to EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8722;95.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at the EEF strength 0.005&#8197;a.u.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of the Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid&#8208;mediated activation of an S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxide allows for the cyclization of peptides through metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation of arenes. The less electrophilic S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine sulfoxide serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of nucleophilic cysteine in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride under acidic conditions. It is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization, which results in the synthesis of an Amatoxin derivative and stapled peptide possessing a tryptathionine structure.







Abstract
Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapled peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol, which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of a thioether linkage between tryptophan and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapled peptides possessing the Cys&#8208;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less&#8208;electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of a Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Quinoidal Polymers Based on Dipyrrolopyrazinedione for Application in All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers (PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT) based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were developed for the use as polymer acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The all&#8208;PSCs with pseudo&#8208;bilayer structure exhibited PCEs of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;% for PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules and polymers with intrinsic quinoidal structure are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, which have been reported for application in field&#8208;effect transistors and thermoelectric devices. In principle, the molecular and electronic characteristics of quinoidal polymers can also enable their application in organic solar cells. Herein, two quinoidal polymers, named PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were synthesized and used as electron acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Both PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT showed suitable energy levels and wide light absorption range that extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. When combined with the polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the resulting all&#8208;PSCs based on PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;%, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;PSCs was revealed to be mainly limited by the relatively poor and imbalanced charge transport, considerable charge recombination. Detailed investigations on the structure&#8208;performance relationship suggested that synergistic optimization of light absorption, energy levels, and charge transport properties is needed to achieve more successful application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Engineered Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrion is a promising target in cancer therapy. However, gaining access to this organelle is difficult due to the obstacles to cross the complicated mitochondrial membrane. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability, named mitochondrion&#8208;targeting peptides (MTPs), are efficient tools to deliver exogenous therapeutics into mitochondria. Herein, we report several new MTPs, which can be readily synthesized via resin&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. In particular, MTP3 (compound 5), consisting of three positively charged arginines and two D&#8208; and L&#8208; alternating naphthylalanines, demonstrated excellent mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability with high Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient, suggesting that MTP3 has good potential for mitochondrion&#8208;targeted drug delivery. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the feasibility of MTP3 was validated by the preparation of a mitochondrion&#8208;targeting prodrug (compound 17, doxorubicin&#8208;based prodrug). This prodrug was subsequently confirmed to be specifically transported to the mitochondria of tumour cells, where it was able to release the native doxorubicin upon intracellular GSH activation, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and eventually cell death. Importantly, compound 17 showed good cytotoxicity against human tumour cells while negligible toxicity towards normal cells, indicating its potential as a potent mitochondrial medicine for targeted cancer therapy. Our study thus opens a way for engineered CPPs to be used to deliver bioactive cargos in mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

This prodrug was subsequently confirmed to be specifically transported to the mitochondria of tumour cells, where it was able to release the native doxorubicin upon intracellular GSH activation, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and eventually cell death. Importantly, compound 17 showed good cytotoxicity against human tumour cells while negligible toxicity towards normal cells, indicating its potential as a potent mitochondrial medicine for targeted cancer therapy. Our study thus opens a way for engineered CPPs to be used to deliver bioactive cargos in mitochondrion-targeted cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Large&#8208;Polarization Ferroelectric with Second Harmonic Generation Response in a Novel Crown Ether Clathrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modern material: A novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric, [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4], has successfully been synthesized; it underwent a reversible structural phase transition around Tc=348&#8197;K, with a wide band gap of 4.43&#8197;eV. The chief contributors to this are the C, H and O atoms of the crystals, the obvious second harmonic generation response and the large value of spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of around 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase transitions are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper is described the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4] (1) that shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348&#8197;K (heating) and 331&#8197;K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17&#8197;K by differential scanning calorimetry measurements, thus indicating that 1 undergoes a reversible structural phase transition. Variable&#8208;temperature PXRD and temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase&#8208;transition behavior of 1. The second harmonic response demonstrates that 1 belongs to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. In its semiconducting properties, 1 shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43&#8197;eV that comes chiefly from the C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of 1 exhibit a typical polarization&#8208;electric hysteresis loop with a large spontaneous polarization (Ps) of about 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic&#8208;inorganic and other hybrid crystals.

         <title>Molecular recognition of natural and non&#8208;natural substrates by cellodextrin phosphorylase from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum investigated by NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;1&#8594;4&#8208;glucan polysaccharides like cellulose, derivatives and analogues, are attracting attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, as ideal candidates for many different applications in biotechnology.

Extending the FLP library: Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl or imidazolyl substituents act as intramolecular N/P frustrated Lewis pairs that are capable of small molecule activation, that is, reversible CO2 sequestration and binding of carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes.







Abstract
Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl (3[OTf]) or imidazolyl (4[OTf])&#8208;substituents act as intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) and reversibly form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts with CO2 (5+ and 6+). An unusual and labile spirocyclic tetrahedral intermediate (72+) is observed in CO2&#8208;pressurized (0.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;bar) solutions of cation 4+ at low temperatures, as demonstrated by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies, which were confirmed crystallographically. In addition, cations 3+ and 4+ actively bind carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, as shown by selected examples.

         <title>Segregated Protein&#8208;Cucurbit[7]uril Crystalline Architectures via Modulatory Peptide Tectons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One approach to protein assembly involves water&#8208;soluble supramolecular receptors that act like glue. Bionano&#8208;architectures directed by these scaffolds are often system&#8208;specific with few studies investigating their customization. Here, we describe the modulation of cucurbituril&#8208;mediated protein assemblies via the inclusion of peptide tectons. Three peptides of varying length and structural order were N&#8208;terminally appended to RSL, a &#946;&#8208;propeller building block. Each fusion protein was incorporated into crystalline architectures mediated by cucurbit[7]uril (Q7). A trimeric coiled coil served as a spacer within a  Q7 &#8208;directed sheet assembly of RSL, giving rise to a layered material of varying porosity. Within the spacer layers, the coiled coils were dynamic. This result prompted consideration of intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs) as modulatory tectons. Similar to the coiled coil, a mussel adhesion peptide (Mefp) also acted as a spacer between protein&#8208;Q7  sheets. In contrast, the fusion of a nucleoporin peptide (Nup) to RSL did not recapitulate the sheet assembly. Instead, a  Q  &#8208;directed cage was adopted, within which disordered Nup peptides were partially &#8220;captured&#8221; by  Q7  receptors. IDP capture occurred by macrocycle recognition of an intrapeptide Phe&#8208;Gly motif in which the benzyl side chain was encapsulated by  Q7. The modularity of these protein&#8208;cucurbituril architectures adds a new dimension to macrocycle&#8208;mediated protein assembly. In addition, the segregated crystals, with alternating layers of high and low porosity, provide a basis for new types of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication&#160;of ZnSe/C Hollow Polyhedrons for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnSe has got extensive attention for high&#8208;performance LIBs anode due to its remarkable theoretical capacity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the large volume variation for the ZnSe in the discharge/charge processes brings about rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance. Herein, ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons are successfully synthesized through selenization of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) coating. The protection of C layer derived from RF coating layer and Ostwald ripening during the process of selenization play important roles in promoting formation of ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons. The ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons exhibit good rate behavior and long&#8208;term cycle stability (345 mAh g  &#8722;1  up to 1000 cycles at 1 A g  &#8208;1  ) for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) anode. The improved electrochemical performance is benefit from the unique ZnSe/C hollow architecture, in which the hollow structure can effectively avoid terrible volume expansion, and the thin ZnSe/C shell can not only provide adequate diffusion paths of lithium ions and but also enhance the electronic conductivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoro&#8208;substitution on the ribose moiety (e.g., 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide) represents a popular way to modulate the ribose conformation and, hence, the structure and function of nucleic acids. In the present study, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxythymidine (  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T) and introduced it to oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs). Though scission of the glycosylic bond of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T followed by strand cleavage occurred to some extent under alkaline conditions, the  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T&#8208;modified ODNs were rather stable in neutral buffers. NMR studies showed that like 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside,  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T exists predominantly in the North conformation not only in the nucleoside form but also in the context of ODN strands. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, thermal denaturing and RNase H1 footprinting studies of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T&#8208;modified ODN/cDNA and ODN/cRNA duplexes indicated that the North conformation tendency of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T is maintained in the duplexes, leading to a local structural perturbation. Collectively, 4&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide structurally resembles the 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide but imparts less structural perturbation to the duplex than the latter.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals: growth, composition determination and phase stability in highly moist atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solutions have shown superior optoelectronic properties and better stability than their ABX  3  simple perovskite counterparts under ambient conditions. However, crystal growth and identification of the accurate composition of these complex crystalline compounds remain challenging, and their stability under extreme conditions such as in highly moist atmosphere is unknown. Herein, large&#8208;size (up to 2 cm) single crystals of ternary perovskite 0.80FAPbI  3  &#183;x'FAPbBr  3  &#183;y'CsPbI  3  (x' + y' = 0.20) are grown. An elemental analysis method based on wavelength dispersive X&#8208;ray fluorescence is proposed to determine their accurate compositions. Among these single crystals, the composition with y' = 0.12 shows the best moisture stability at 90% relative humidity for 15 days. Other components with richer or poorer Cs  +  ions undergo different phase segregation behaviours. The performance and stability of photodetectors based on these single crystals are tested. This work offers a deeper insight into phase stability of ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution crystals in highly moist atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the intrinsic activity and electrochemical surface area of MoS2 via tiny Zn doping: toward an efficient HER catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum sulfide (MoS  2  ) is considered as an alternative material for commercial platinum catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Improving the apparent HER activity of MoS  2  to a level comparable to that of Pt is an essential premise for the commercial use of MoS  2  . In this work, a Zn&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to enhance the HER performance of MoS  2  . We prove that tiny Zn doping into MoS  2  leads to the enhancement of the electrochemical surface area, increases in proportion of HER active 1T phase in the material and formation of catalytic sites of higher intrinsic activity. These benefits result in a high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 190 mV(@10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec  &#8208;1  . The origin for the excellent electrochemical performance of the doped MoS  2  is rationalized with both experimental and theoretical investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolonging the Triplet State Lifetimes of Rhenium Complexes with Imidazole&#8208;pyridine Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into fuels offers the prospect for creating a new CO  2  economy. Harnessing visible light&#8208;driven CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction mediated by the long&#8208;lived triplet excited state of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes is a challenging approach. We here develop a series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes (  Re&#8208;1  &#8722;  Re&#8208;4  ) based on the imidazole&#8208;pyridine skeleton for photo&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction. These catalysts are featured by combining pyridyl&#8208;imidazole with the aromatic ring and different pendant organic groups onto the N1 position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit, which display phosphorescence under Ar&#8208;saturated solution even at ambient conditions. By contrast, {Re[9&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;10&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;pyreno[4,5&#8208;d]imidazole)](CO)  3  Cl} (  Re&#8208;4  ) by introducing pyrene ring at the N1 position of pyrene&#8208;fused imidazole unit exhibits superior catalytic performance with a higher turnover number for CO (TON  CO  = 124) and &gt;99.9% selectivity, primarily ascribed to the strong visible light&#8208;harvesting ability, long&#8208;lived triplet lifetimes (164.2 &#181;s) and large reductive quenching constant. Moreover, the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes derived from &#960;&#8208;extended pyrene chromophore exhibit a long lifetime corresponding to its ligand&#8208;localized triplet state (  3  IL) evidenced from spectroscopic investigations and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Shape&#8208;persistent Tetrahedral Porphyrin System: Light&#8208;induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraphenylmethane appended with four pyridylpyridinium units works as a scaffold to self&#8208;assemble four ruthenium porphyrins in a tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent giant architecture. The resulting supramolecular structure has been characterised in the solid state by X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis and in solution by various techniques. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirms the 1:4 stoichiometry with the formation of a highly symmetric structure. The self&#8208;assembly process can be monitored by changes of the redox potentials, as well as by modifications in the visible absorption spectrum of the ruthenium porphyrin and by a complete quenching of both the bright fluorescence of the tetracationic scaffold and the weak phosphorescence of the ruthenium porphyrin. An ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer is responsible for this quenching process. The lifetime of the resulting charge separated state (800 ps) is about four times longer in the giant supramolecular structure compared to the model 1:1 complex formed by the ruthenium porphyrin and a single pyridylpyridinium unit. Electron delocalization over the tetrameric pyridinium structure is likely to be responsible for this effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Quenched Lewis Acidity: Studies on the Medium Dependent Fluorescence of Zinc(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new zinc(II) coordination units  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  based on planar&#8208;directing tetradentate Schiff base&#8208;like ligands  H  2  (1  &#8211;  3)  were synthesized. Their solid&#8208;state structures were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing the tendency to overcome the square&#8208;planar coordination sphere by axial ligation. Affinity in solution towards axial ligation has been tested by extended spectroscopic studies, both in the absorption and emission mode. The electronic spectrum of the pyridine complex  [Zn(1)(py)]  has been characterized by multiconfiguration pair&#8208;DFT to validate the results of extended TD&#8208;DFT studies. Green emission of non&#8208;emissive solutions of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  in chloroform could be switched on in the presence of potent Lewis&#8208;bases. While interpretation in terms of an equilibrium of stacked/non&#8208;fluorescent and destacked/fluorescent species is in line with precedents from literature, the sensitivity of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  was greatly reduced. Results of a computation&#8208;based structure search allow to trace the hidden Lewis acidity of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  to a new stacking motif, resulting in a strongly enhanced stability of the dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Arylmethylene Substitutions on Molecular Structure, Optoelectronic Properties and Photovoltaic Performance of Dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we developed two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based SMAs (DTCFSV&#8208;IC and DTCFDV&#8208;IC) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA (DTCFO&#8208;IC) without conjugated side chains. Combined with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, DTCFSV&#8208;IC&#8208;based polymer solar cells (PSCs) delivered an inferior PCE but an increased Voc of 1.04 V relative to DTCFO&#8208;IC. Whereas, an enhanced PCE of 8.89% was realized for DTCFDV&#8208;IC&#8208;based PSCs due to concurrently increased Voc (1.04 V) and Jsc (15.98 mA cm&#8208;2). When PBDB&#8208;T was substituted with PBDB&#8208;TF, the DTCFDV&#8208;IC&#8208;based PSC produced a further increased Voc of 1.14 V, but a slightly reduced PCE of 8.30%. Encouragingly, for the PBDB&#8208;TF:DTCFDV&#8208;IC system, a comparably high PCE of 8.82% was achieved when o&#8208;xylene (XY) was used to replace chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvent. The superior device performance of PSCs based on PBDB&#8208;T:DTCFDV&#8208;IC (CB) and PBDB&#8208;TF:DTCFDV&#8208;IC (XY) could be ascribed to higher and more balanced carrier mobility, more efficiently charge transfer, weaker bimolecular recombination, and better active layer morphology and miscibility. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device&#160;physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here, we developed two dithienocyclopentafluorene-based SMAs (DTCFSV-IC and DTCFDV-IC) featuring methylene-functionalized conjugated side chains to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA (DTCFO-IC) without conjugated side chains. Combined with polymer donor PBDB-T, DTCFSV-IC-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) delivered an inferior PCE but an increased Voc of 1.04 V relative to DTCFO-IC. Whereas, an enhanced PCE of 8.89% was realized for DTCFDV-IC-based PSCs due to concurrently increased Voc (1.04 V) and Jsc (15.98 mA cm-2). When PBDB-T was substituted with PBDB-TF, the DTCFDV-IC-based PSC produced a further increased Voc of 1.14 V, but a slightly reduced PCE of 8.30%. Encouragingly, for the PBDB-TF:DTCFDV-IC system, a comparably high PCE of 8.82% was achieved when o-xylene (XY) was used to replace chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvent. The superior device performance of PSCs based on PBDB-T:DTCFDV-IC (CB) and PBDB-TF:DTCFDV-IC (XY) could be ascribed to higher and more balanced carrier mobility, more efficiently charge transfer, weaker bimolecular recombination, and better active layer morphology and miscibility.

         <title>Intermetallic Compounds: Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Characterized by long&#8208;range atomic ordering, well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, and controlled crystal structure, intermetallics have attracted increasing attention in the area of chemical synthesis and catalytic applications. Liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics has arisen as the promising methodology due to its precise control over size, shape, and resistance toward sintering compared with the traditional metallurgy. This short review tends to provide perspectives on the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics in terms of both thermodynamics and methodology, as well as its applications in various catalytic reactions. Specifically, basic thermodynamics and kinetics in the synthesis of intermetallics will be first discussed, followed by discussing the main factors that will affect the formation of intermetallics during synthesis. The application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis will be demonstrated case by case at last. We conclude the review with perspectives on the future developments with respect to both synthesis and catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breathing phenomenon in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has revealed supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions, which could be beneficial for chemical separation in numerous industrial applications. The cost&#8208;effective purification of C  8  alkyl aromatics such as o&#8208;xylene, p&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, and ethylbenzene still remains challenging owing to their similar molecular structures, boiling points, kinetic diameters, polarities, etc. Herein, we report two Zn&#8208;based pillar&#8208;bilayered MOFs, denoted as [Zn  2  (aip)  2  (pillar)]; aip = 5&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid; pillar: bpy = 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or bpe = 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane, which exhibit a breathing effect depending on the adsorbed guest molecules. Guest&#8208;dependent sorption studies using organic solvents such as  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylformamide, methanol,&#160; benzene, and water vapor displays reversible structural flexibility through breathing effect in both framework compounds. Motivated by these sorption studies, the conducted experiments on C  8&#8208;alkyl aromatics resulting in both MOF compounds can access these isomers in the shrunken pores and, thereby expand the pore size by framework breathing. In C  8  binary mixtures, these Zn&#8208;MOFs exhibit selective sorption properties based on the different interactions between guest C  8  aromatics interactions and framework structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Strategy to Design and Construct AIE&#8208;active Mechanofluorochromic Materials via Regulation of Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we first designed and synthesized tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives  TM&#8208;1~4  via regulation of molecular structure,which were consisted of 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline, 1H&#8208;phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole, 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole, 3,3'&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)dipyridine moieties and AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene units, respectively. The results illustrated that  TM&#8208;1~4  exhibited obvious AIE characteristics. Meanwhile,  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  show excellent solid emission properties (&#934;  TM&#8208;2  =13.73% and &#934;  TM&#8208;3  =36.21%), whereas  TM&#8208;1  and  TM&#8208;4  exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;  TM&#8208;1  =1.48% and &#934;  TM&#8208;4  =4.83%). The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene ring) causes twisted conformations of the molecule that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid emission(&#934;  TM&#8208;2  &lt;&#934;  TM&#8208;3  , &#934;  TM&#8208;1  &lt;&#934;  TM&#8208;4  ). Significantly,  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;  TM&#8208;2  =43 nm and &#916;&#955;  TM&#8208;3  =41 nm) with color changes between blue and green emissions. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) suggested the disordered state of ground sample could be readily returned to an ordered crystalline. Therefore, the mechanochromisms of  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  are ascribable to the phase transformation between crystal and amorphous structure. The single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of  TM&#8208;2  reveals a twisted conformation for  TPE  moiety and the absence of &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular stacking. These excellent optical properties of  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  make them potentially applications in mechanochromic materials and imaging agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Functional Differences of Cysteine and 3&#8208;Mercaptopropionate Dioxygenases: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spheres of influence: Although cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase bind and react similar substrates, there are key differences in the first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination spheres that affect their catalytic reaction mechanism and reactivity, as highlighted by density functional theory studies on large enzyme clusters.







Abstract
Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health; they are involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine. As such, these enzymes have relevance to the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large, active&#8208;site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo&#8208;bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes in substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.

         <title>Photocatalyzed E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Boronates with Binaphthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going against the grain: Photocatalytic, contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is described. The reaction permits the geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The reaction manifold was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is disclosed. The reaction, based on the transient formation of a suitable chromophore with a BINOL derivative as the catalyst, allowed geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The mechanism of this E&#8594;Z contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization was studied, and the formation of a transient chromophore species is suggested.

         <title>Rational Design of a Confacial Pentaoctahedron Anisotropic Exchange in a Linear ZnIIFeIIIFeIIIFeIIIZnII Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first confacial pentaoctahedron comprised of transition metal ions namely Zn  II  Fe  III  A  Fe  III  B  Fe  III  A  Zn  II  has been synthesized using a dinucleating nonadentate ligand. The face&#8208;sharing bridging mode enforces short Zn  II  &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Fe  III  A  and Fe  III  A  &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Fe  III  B  distances of 2.83 and 2.72 &#197;, respectively.  Ab&#8208;initio  CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations provide significant negative zero&#8208;field splittings for Fe  III  A  and Fe  III  B  with \  D  A  \ &gt; \  D  B  \ with the main component along the  C  3  axis. Hence, a spin&#8208;Hamiltonian comprised of anisotropic exchange, zero&#8208;field, and Zeeman term was employed. This allowed by following the boundary conditions from the theoretical results the simulation in a theory&#8208;guided parameter determination with  J  xy  =+0.37,  J  z  =&#8208;0.32,  D  A  =&#8208;1.21,  E  A  =&#8208;0.24,  D  B  =&#8208;0.35, and  E  B  =&#8208;0.01 cm  &#8208;1  supported by simulations of high&#8208;field magnetic M&#246;ssbauer spectra recorded at 2 K. The weak but ferromagnetic Fe  III  A  Fe  III  B  interaction arises from the small bridging angle of 84.8&#176; being at the switch from anti&#8208; to ferromagnetic for the face&#8208;sharing bridging mode.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Conductance Switching Realized by a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Imine Polymer Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving your memory: Combining the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer pore of pillar[5]arene with the nanometer pore structure of two&#8208;dimensional polymers provides a multichannel for Ag+ migration so that a ternary&#8208;state memristor based on the conductive filament mechanism could be designed. The obtained Ag/2DPTPAZ+TAPB/ITO devices show excellent ternary memory performance, including low threshold voltage, steady retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio, considerable ternary yield, and good thermal stability and flexibility.







Abstract
Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.&#8201;e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired so as to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report the first multichannel strategy to realize a ternary&#8208;state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of a two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with multilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2=1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;103), and high ternary yield (75&#8201;%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DPTPAZ+TAPB can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after being bent 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a temperature as high as 300&#8201;&#176;C. It is envisioned that the results of this work will open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption, and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;Phase Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native mass spectrometry is now widely used in protein structural studies. We present a methodology for probing the importance of specific residues in the stabilization of compact protein structure in the gas&#8208;phase using a combination of chemical modification and collision induced unfolding ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.

         <title>On the roles of electron transfer in catalysis by nanoclusters and nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron transfer plays a major role in chemical reactions and processes, and this is particularly true in catalysis by nanomaterials. The advent of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts recently including atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs) as parts of nanocalyst devices has brought an increased control of the relationship between the NP and NC structures and their catalytic functions. Consequently, the molecular definition of these new nanocatalysts has allowed a better understanding and management of various kinds of electron transfers involved in the catalytic processes. In this mini&#8208;review I am bringing a chemist's view of several major aspects of electron transfer functions concerning NPs and NCs in catalytic processes. Particular focus concerns the role of NPs and NCs as electron reservoirs and light&#8208;induced antenna in catalytic processes from H  2  generation to more complex reactions and sustainable energy production.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Preparation of CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Moving one step further beyond lithium? A nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 material has been synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Its excellent rate performance, outstanding cycling stability and pseudocapacitive energy storage properties give it promise for use as an efficient cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered a promising energy&#8208;storage device due to their high energy density and high safety, but they still suffer from a lack of high&#8208;rate performance and cycle performance of the cathode. Nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites have been synthesized for the first time by a facile solvothermal method. Herein, the magnesium ion storage behavior when applied in the cathode for RMBs is discussed. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 256&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and an outstanding long&#8208;term cyclic stability over 300&#8197;cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the electrochemical storage mechanism demonstrated that the storage process of magnesium ion in the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 cathode is mainly driven by strong pseudocapacitive effects.

         <dc:description>The first total syntheses of the  Stemona  alkaloid dehydrostenine A and the structure assigned to dehydrostenine B have been completed from a simple pyrrole substrate in 10 and 11 steps, respectively. Two independent Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular Michael additions were exploited to construct the tetracyclic dehydrostenine core. As a result of our synthetic studies and associated analysis of the relevant literature, we propose revisions of the structures originally assigned to dehydrostenines A and B.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazophosphonates: Effective surrogates for Diazoalkanes in Pyrazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazophosphonates, readily prepared from a&#8208;ketophosphonates by oxidation of the corresponding hydrazones in batch or in flow, are useful partners in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles, including the first intramolecular examples of such a process. The phosphoryl group imbues a number of desirable properties in the diazo 1,3&#8208;dipole. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the phosphoryl stabilizes the diazo compound making it easier to handle, whilst the ability of the phosphoryl group to migrate readily in a [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enables its transfer from C to N to aromatize the initial cycloadduct, and hence its facile removal from the final pyrazole product. Overall, the diazophosphonate acts as a surrogate for the much less stable diazoalkane in cycloadditions, with the phosphoryl group playing a vital, but traceless, role. The cycloaddition proceeds more readily with alkynes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, and is regiospecific with unsymmetrical alkynes. The potential for use of diazophosphonates in bioorthogonal cycloadditions is demonstrated by their facile addition to strained alkynes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe oxidatively induced regioselective intramolecular C&#8208;C bond formations based on the Rh  III  complexes synthesized from dirhodium(II) trifluoroacetate with 2&#8208;arylpyridines. With the selection of electron donating groups on the arene rings of 2&#8208;arylpyridines, the unusual  meta  &#8208;  ortho  C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming was favored, which led to the formation of  meta  &#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylpyridine homocoupling dimers. On the contrary, the electron withdrawing groups have tendency to occur conventional  ortho&#8208;ortho  bond&#8208;forming, resulting in the formation of new Rh  III  complexes possessing the intriguing Rh  III  (TFA)  3  fragment. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of Rh  III  occurred in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported CuII Single Ion Catalyst for Total&#8208;carbon Utilization of C2&#8208;C3 Biomass&#8208;based Platform Molecules in N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shift from fossil carbon sources to renewable ones is vital for developing sustainable chemical processes to produce valuable chemicals. In this work, value&#8208;added formamides were synthesized in good yields by the reaction of amines with C2&#8208;C3 biomass&#8208;based platform molecules such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. These feedstocks were selectively converted by catalysts based on Cu&#8208;containing zeolite 5A via in&#8208;situ formation of carbonyl&#8208;containing intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which all the carbon atoms in biomass&#8208;based feedstocks might be amidated to result in the formamide product. Combined catalyst characterization results revealed preferably single CuII sites on the surface of Cu/5A, some of which form small clusters, but without direct linkage via oxygen bridges. By combing the results of EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spin&#8208;trapping, operando ATR&#8208;IR (attenuated total reflection infrared) spectroscopy and control experiments, it has been found that the formation of formamides might involve a HCOOH&#8208;like intermediate and &#8226;NHPh radicals, where the selective formation of &#8226;OOH radicals might play a key role.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (  1  ) with cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208; or anthracene&#8208;stabilised metalate anions of iron and cobalt consistently afford complexes of the rarely encountered 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene ligand, which have previously been very challenging synthetic targets. The subsequent reactivity of 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward various electrophiles has also been investigated and is compared to reactions of related 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The results highlight the distinct reactivity of such isomeric species, showing that the 1,2&#8208;isomers can act as precursors for previously unknown triphospholium ligands. The electronic structures of the new complexes were investigated by several methods, including NMR, EPR and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopies as well as quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared spectrum of the first excited state of Au2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au  2  +  is a simple but crucial model system for understanding the diverse catalytic activity of gold. While the Au  2  +  ground state (X  2  S  g  +  ) is understood reasonably well from mass spectrometry and computations, no spectroscopic information is available its first excited state (A  2  S  u  +  ). Herein, we present the vibrationallyresolved electronic spectrum of this state for cold Ar&#8208;tagged Au  2  +  cations. This exceptionally low&#8208;lying and well isolated A  2  S  (u)  +  &#172;X  2  S  (g)  +  transition occurs in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. The observed band origin (5738 cm  &#8208;1  , 1742.9 nm, 0.711 eV) and harmonic Au&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Ar stretch frequencies (201 and 133 cm  &#8208;1  ) agree surprisingly well with those predicted by standard time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. The linearly&#8208;bonded Ar tag has only little impact on both the geometric and electronic structure of Au  2  +  , because the Au  2  +  &#8230;Ar bond (0.4 eV) is much weaker than the Au&#8208;Au bond (2.2 eV). As a result of 6s&#172;5d excitation of an electron from the antibonding s  u  * orbital (HOMO&#8208;1) into the bonding s  g  orbital (SOMO), the Au&#8208;Au bond contracts substantially (by 0.1 &#197;).</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trivalent lanthanide heteroleptic sandwich complexes with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) and cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligands shows a significant bending of the Cnt ligand when the size of the ion decreases, implying a size&#8208;controlled hapticity switch.







Abstract
Sandwich complexes of lanthanides have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as Single Molecule Magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln=Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by 1H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.

         <title>Achieving High Efficiency at High Luminance in Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Triplet&#8211;Triplet Fusion Based on Phenanthroimidazole&#8208;Benzothiadiazole Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
On a high: A series of phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;based fluorescent donor&#8211;acceptor molecules were designed and synthesized. They exhibited emissions ranging from green to red with high photoluminescence quantum yield in the solid state. These molecules also showed highly efficient electroluminescence at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application of any kind of light&#8208;emitting diode (LED). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP&#8208;, PIBzPCN&#8208;, and PIBzTPA&#8208;based devices showed EQEs of 8.27, 9.15, and 8.64&#8201;%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselectivity of the peptide coupling between aminoacidylnucleotides and amino acid esters in aqueous condensation buffer was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Homochiral dipeptides were found as the preferred products.







Abstract
Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in&#8197;situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5&#8242;&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios&#8804;62&#8201;:&#8201;38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.

An attractive precursor 3&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) with coplanar bicyclic backbone was synthesized. Two nitrated products of 5 were prepared, and a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich energetic salts were obtained and systematically characterized. These 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials exhibited high combined nitrogen and oxygen content and outstanding enthalpies of formation along with good detonation performance and an acceptable safety profile. Among them, N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide and its dihydroxylammonium salt were screened as the most balanced energetic materials.







Abstract
Combining different nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine&#8208;tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Here, 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4&#8208;triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3&#8208;(5&#8208;Amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) was designed and synthesized. Nitramino&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (6) and N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (7) were also obtained, and two series of corresponding nitrogen&#8208;rich salts were prepared, leading to the creation of new energetic compounds. All derivatives were fully characterized, and five of them were further confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials were studied. Compound 7 and its dihydroxylammonium salt (7&#8201;c) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to that of RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.

         <title>Stepwise Stress&#8208;Induced Transformations of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedral Cluster&#8208;Based Assemblies: Where Conformational and Supramolecular Features Meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squeezed to change: We demonstrate that a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered metal complex with remote phenyl rings can undergo reversible pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events.







Abstract
Understanding the factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity to the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergoing pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events. The observed phase transitions illustrate the key role of an interplay between the low&#8208;energy conformation perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722;, Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) containing the weakly coordinating anion [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722; are reported. Some phenyl derivatives in combination with different alkyl chains were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window. In contrast to gallates with standard cations (EMIM, BMIM) the gallate&#8208;TAAILs are stable even up to high electrochemical potentials. Thus, they are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications. More information can be found in the Communication by B. Hoge, T. Strassner, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102097).

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert on the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like the arms of a dancer, which are waved following the rhythm of the music but avoid colliding with her head or her body; the flexible arms of expanded helicenes find different pathways to reverse their position depending on the size and nature of the insert placed in the innermost zone of their fjord. This work presents the synthesis of a series of in&#8208;fjord substituted expanded helicenes and an estimation of their inversion barriers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum calculations. Interestingly, the energetic profile of the inversions is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.&#8197;A. Mata, M. Alcarazo, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102585).

         <title>Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent lithium storage is achieved by the double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8208;SiO2@N&#8208;C anode material. The outermost N&#8208;C shell can improve the electronic conductivity and promote the dispersion of PMo12 clusters. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion and accelerate Li+ diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. He, W. Chen, Y.&#8208;F. Song et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101638).

         <title>Photoinduced water oxidation in chitosan nanostructures containing covalently&#8208;linked Ru(II) chromophores and encapsulated iridium oxide nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The luminophore Ru(bpy)  2  (dcbpy)  2+&#160;  is covalently&#8208;linked to a chitosan polymer; cross&#8208;linking by tripolyphosphate produced Ru&#8208;decorated chitosan fibers (NP&#8208;RuCh  ), with a 20:1 ratio between chitosan repeating units and Ru(II) chomophores. The properties of the Ru(II) compound are unperturbed by the chitosan structure, with  NP&#8208;RuCh  exhibiting&#160; metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) absorption and emission bands of Ru(II) complexes. When cross&#8208;linking is made in the presence of IrO  2  nanoparticles, such species are encapsulated within the nanofibers, so generating the  IrO  2&#8208;  NP&#8208;RuCh  system, in which both Ru(II) photosensitizers and IrO  2  water oxidation catalysts are within the nanofiber structures.  NP&#8208;RuCh  and  IrO  2&#8208;  NP&#8208;RuCh  have been characterized by DLS, SEM, and EDX, which indicated a 2:1 ratio between Ru(II) chromophores and IrO  2  species. Photochemical water oxidation has been investigated using  IrO  2&#8208;  NP&#8208;RuCh  as the chromophore/catalyst assembly and persulfate anions as sacrificial species: the photochemical water oxidation yields O  2  with a quantum yield (F) of 0.21, definitely higher than the F obtained by a similar solution containing separated Ru(bpy)  3  2+  and IrO  2  nanoparticles (0.05) as well as with respect to that obtained using  NP&#8208;RuCh  and &#8220;free&#8221; IrO  2  nanoparticles (0.10).A fast hole scavenging process (rate constant, 7 x 10  4  s  &#8208;1  ) involving the oxidized photosensitizer and the IrO  2  catalyst within the  IrO  2  &#8208;NP&#8208;RuCh  system is at the basis of the improved photochemical quantum yield of  IrO  2  &#8208;NP&#8208;RuCh  .</dc:description>

         <title>Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Gallium(III)&#8208;Polypyridyl Complexes Bearing Diflunisal</title>

Breaking &#8216;hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill&#8217; bone cancer cells with gallium: Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) are linked to the poor prognosis of metastasised osteosarcoma. Here a gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complex is reported, containing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, diflunisal, capable of killing OSCs more effectively than frontline and secondary anti&#8208;osteosarcoma drugs. The complex evokes cell death by inhibiting cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series, 6 (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably, 6 exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that 6 downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore, 6 induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, 6 is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.

         <title>Topological Transformation of Mg&#8208;Containing Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Efficient Photodriven CH4 Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructural Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst, MgCo&#8208;800, was synthesized by topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MgCo&#8208;LDH) precursor. With its highly dispersed active sites and abundant interfaces, MgCo&#8208;800 enabled surface activation of CH4 to methyl species and showed remarkable photodriven CH4 coupling to C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane (CH4) to fuels and other high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive technology in the chemical industry; however, practical challenges to sustainable processes remain. Herein, we report the preparation of a heterostructured Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst through topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) calcination from 200 to 1100&#8201;&#176;C. Remarkably, the catalyst can activate CH4 coupling to produce C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation through calcination of LDH at 800&#8201;&#176;C. Characterization studies and catalytic results suggest that the highly dispersed active sites and large interfaces amongst the Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalysts enable surface activation of CH4 to methyl (CH3*), in turn promoting coupling of CH3* to C2H6. This study introduces a promising pathway for photodriven CH4 coupling to give high value&#8208;added chemicals by using layered double hydroxides as a precursor.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Stabilized Pnictinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair, 1, with trichlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony allowed the isolation of oxidative addition products. Reduction of these compounds with sodium metal or LiBHEt3 led to the synthesis of a phosphinidene, an arsinidene and a stibinidene. After halide abstraction, a germaphosphene, 8, was isolated, and its 31P NMR data were analyzed by using quantum chemical calculations. The product of an Al&#8722;H addition was found upon treating the phosphinidene with [iBu2AlH]2.







Abstract
The reaction of the intramolecular germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4GeAr* (1) with Group 15 element trichlorides ECl3 (E=P, As, Sb) was investigated. After oxidative addition, the resulting compounds (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)ECl2 (2: E=P, 3: E=As, 4: E=Sb) were reduced by using sodium metal or LiHBEt3. The molecular structures of the phosphine&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)P (5), arsinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)As (6) and stibinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)Sb (7) are presented; they feature a two&#8208;coordinate low&#8208;valent Group 15 element. After chloride abstraction, a cyclic germaphosphene [(o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)GeP] [B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (8) was isolated. The 31P NMR data of the germaphosphene were compared with literature examples and analyzed by quantum chemical calculations. The phosphinidene was treated with [iBu2AlH]2, and the product of an Al&#8722;H addition to the low&#8208;valent phosphorus atom (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(H)P(H)Al(C4H9)2 (9) was characterized.

         <title>Electrocatalytic H2 Generation from Water Relying on Cooperative Ligand Electron Transfer in &#8220;PN3P&#8221; Pincer&#8208;Supported NiII Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Towards sustainable H2 production: To bring electrocatalytic hydrogen production into the sustainable realm, earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts should function with water as the substrate. These newly reported hydrogen&#8208;generating catalysts of NiII are robust, stable in air and electrocatalytically reduce water to hydrogen with excellent Faradaic efficiency. Computations supplemented our understanding of a unique ligand&#8208;based electron transfer with the cooperativity of the PN3P ligand as an electron reservoir as a requirement for successful catalysis.







Abstract
Water is the most sustainable source for H2 production, and the efficient electrocatalytic production of H2 from mixed water/acetonitrile solutions by using two new air&#8208;stable nickel(II) pincer complexes, [Ni(&#954;3&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=H I, Me II) is reported. Hydrogen generation from H2O/CH3CN solutions is initiated at &#8722;2&#8197;V against Fc+/0, and bulk electrocatalysis studies showed that the catalyst functions with an excellent Faradaic efficiency and a turnover frequency of 160&#8197;s&#8722;1. A DFT computational investigation of the reduction behavior of I and II revealed a correlation of H2 formation with charge donation from electrons originating in a reduced ligand&#8208;localized orbital. As a result, these catalysts are proposed to proceed by a novel mechanism involving electron/proton transfer between a Ni0I species bonded to an anionic PN3P ligand (&#8220;L&#8722;/Ni0I&#8221;) and a NiI&#8208;hydride (&#8220;Ni&#8722;H&#8221;). Furthermore, these catalysts are able to reduce phenol and acetic acid, more active proton sources, at lower potentials that correlate with the substrate pKa.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Ultra&#8208;Stretchable Strain Sensors Based on Emulsion Gels with Broad Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking the strain: An emulsion gel with high stretchability and conductivity was fabricated and could be used as a strain sensor to detect human motion over a broad operating temperature. First, an emulsion that was ultra&#8208;stable at high and low temperatures was prepared by introducing glycerol into a W/W emulsion. Then, the continuous phase was polymerized to produce a macroporous emulsion gel. Finally, an emulsion&#8208;gel&#8208;based strain sensor with good flexibility, conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and adhesion properties was fabricated to detect the full range of human body movement. The sensor exhibited remarkable sensing sensitivity, rapid responsiveness, and reliability. For more information, see the Full Paper by J. Hao et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101472).

         <title>Octapalladium Strings Trap C60 and C70 Fullerenes Affording Metal&#8208;Chain&#8208;Wired Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover picture shows octapalladium metal strings catching a soccer ball of C60 or C70 fullerene in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction to give metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired bucky balls. The enantiopure chiral Pd8 strings also afforded the chiral bucky balls through dimensionally and chirality controlled self&#8208;assembly. These findings could provide a new platform for developing functional metal&#8208;carbon nanocomposite materials, including nano&#8208;electronics with unusual properties derived from the combination of redox active fullerenes and metal chains.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our understanding of the factors affecting the stability of cyclic  d  /  l  peptide (CP) nanotubes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CP nanotube stability through X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterise the distinct CP&#8208;CP alignments that can form and identify stable and unstable dimers by MD simulation. We measure H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives of synthesised CPs by  1  H&#8208;D exchange experiments and find good correlation with predicted CP&#8208;CP stabilities. We find that hydrophobic amino acids improve CP dimer stability but experimentally reduce solubility. Charged amino acids either increase or decrease CP dimer stability depending on the relative orientation and composition of charged groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are solved for two CPs, revealing non&#8208;tubular folded conformations. Ultimately, this work will assist the educated design of stable tubular structures for potential applications in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Agile Detection of Chemical Warfare Agents by Machine Vision: a Supramolecular Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart(phone) recognition: A new fluorescent sensor able to interact noncovalently with DMMP, a CWA simulant, has been synthetized and tested both in solution and in the gas phase. The detection limit in solution is much lower than the toxicity values of CWAs; in the gas phase sensing can be performed on a simple smartphone. With acid/base treatment, the solid device can be reused. This prototype paves the way for the smart detection of nerve agents.







Abstract
The supramolecular detection by image analysis of a simulant chemical warfare agent on a solid device containing a selective molecular sensor based on a BODIPY scaffold is reported. The recognition properties were investigated in solution, demonstrating high affinity (log&#8201;K&#8197;6.60) and sensitivity (LOD 10&#8197;ppt). A test strip also confirmed the sensing properties in gas phase. Image analysis of the solid device allows quantitative information about the simulant to be obtained, recovering the sensor almost 5&#8197;times and thus confirming the goal of the supramolecular approach.

         <title>Novel Cofacial Porphyrin&#8208;Based Homo&#8208; and Heterotrimetallic Complexes of Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde is presented in this work. Besides the novel aryl&#8208;based, trans&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene trisporphyrin, we investigated the respective cis&#8208;isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar&#8208;chiral trisporphyrin. The homotrimetallic Mn(III)&#8208;, Fe(III)&#8208;, Ni(II)&#8208;, Cu(II)&#8208;, Zn(II)&#8208; and Pd(II) complexes and the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) heterotrimetalic complex were synthesized, the metal ion insertion process studied and the resulting compounds investigated by e.&#8201;g. UV&#8208;Vis, photoluminescence or high&#8208;resolution IMS measurements.







Abstract
We present a straightforward and generally applicable synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes. The protocol encompasses synthesising the first aryl&#8208;based, trans&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene trisporphyrin starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde with an overall yield of 3.6&#8201;%. It also allows investigating the respective cis&#8208;isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar&#8208;chiral trisporphyrin. The free&#8208;base ligand was used in subsequent metalation reactions to afford the corresponding homotrimetallic Mn(III)&#8208;, Fe(III)&#8208;, Ni(II)&#8208;, Cu(II)&#8208;, Zn(II)&#8208; and Pd(II) complexes &#8211; additionally, a small adaptation of the protocol resulted in the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) complex in a total yield of 2.3&#8201;%. By monitoring Ni(II) insertion into the empty trimeric ligands, we affirmed that the outer porphyrin rings are filled before the internal ring. The molecular species were characterised by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, photoluminescence, IR, MS, CID, and high&#8208;resolution IMS measurements.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A synthesis route&lt;/b&gt; for cofacially linked homo- and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde is presented in this work. Besides the novel aryl-based, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene trisporphyrin, we investigated the respective &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar-chiral trisporphyrin. The homotrimetallic Mn(III)-, Fe(III)-, Ni(II)-, Cu(II)-, Zn(II)- and Pd(II) complexes and the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) heterotrimetalic complex were synthesized, the metal ion insertion process studied and the resulting compounds investigated by e.&#8201;g.

         <title>Syntheses, Structures, Reactivities, and Basicities of Quinolinyl and Isoquinolinyl Complexes of an Electron Rich Chiral Rhenium Fragment and Their Electrophilic Addition Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title complexes exhibit much higher basicities than the parent heterocycles, undergo facile N&#8208;methylation followed by diastereselective nucleophile additions, and can serve as nucleophilic catalysts. These attributes are interpreted with the aid of crystal structures and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Reactions of Li+ [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)]&#8722; with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;chloroquinoline or 1&#8208;chloroisoquinoline give the corresponding &#963; quinolinyl and isoquinolinyl complexes 3, 6, and 8. With 3 and 8 there is further protonation to yield HCl adducts, but additions of KH give the free bases. Treatment of 3 with HBF4&#8901;OEt2 or H(OEt2)2+ BArf&#8722; gives the quinolinium salts [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NH)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+ X&#8722; (3&#8208;H+ X&#8722;; X&#8722;=BF4&#8722;/BArf&#8722;, 94&#8211;98&#8201;%). Addition of CF3SO3CH3 to 3, 6, or 8 affords the corresponding N&#8208;methyl quinolinium salts. In the case of [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+ CF3SO3&#8722; (3&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722;), addition of CH3Li gives the dihydroquinolinium complex (SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;[(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CHCH3)(CH2))]+ CF3SO3&#8722; ((SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;5+ CF3SO3&#8722;, 76&#8201;%) in diastereomerically pure form. Crystal structures of 3&#8208;H+ BArf&#8722;, 3&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722;, (SReRC, RReSC)&#8208;5+ Cl&#8722;, and 6&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722; show that the quinolinium ligands adopt Re&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C conformations that maximize overlap of their acceptor orbitals with the rhenium fragment HOMO, minimize steric interactions with the bulky PPh3 ligand, and promote various &#960; interactions. NMR experiments establish the Br&#248;nsted basicity order 3&gt;8&gt;6, with Ka(BH+) values &gt;10 orders of magnitude greater than the parent heterocycles, although they remain less active nucleophilic catalysts in the reactions tested. DFT calculations provide additional insights regarding Re&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C bonding and conformations, basicities, and the stereochemistry of CH3Li addition.

         <title>Trigonal Prismatic Coordination of Discrete Rare Earth Ions, Enforced by the Polyoxotungstate [P4W27O99(H2O)]16&#8211;</title>

Controlled partial decomposition of the organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized V&#8208;shaped polyoxotungstate [P4W24O92(C6H5PVO)2]16&#8722; generates a {Na&#8834;P4W27} macrocycle with an endo&#8208;oriented pocket that defines an isosceles trigonal&#8208;prismatic coordination environment for yttrium(III) and a wide range of lanthanide(III) ions. The [Na&#8834;{LnIII(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]12&#8722; series undergoes five consecutive (quasi&#8208;)reversible redox transformations.

Abstract
A family of solution&#8208;stable polyanions [Na&#8834;{LnIII(H2O)}{WVIO(H2O)}PV4WVI26O98]12&#8722; (Ln=Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu and Y) represent the first examples of polyoxometalates comprising a single lanthanide(III) or yttrium(III) ion in a rare trigonal prismatic O6 environment. Their synthesis exploits the reactivity of the organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized precursor [P4W24O92(C6H5PVO)2]16&#8722; with heterometal ions and yields hydrated potassium or mixed lithium/potassium salts of composition KxLnyH12&#8211;x&#8211;y[Na&#8834;{Ln(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]&#8901;nH2O&#8901;mLiCl (x=8.5&#8211;11; y=0&#8211;2; n=24&#8211;34; m=0&#8211;1.5).

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali&#8208;Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI=Li&#8722;Cs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI[SeCN] with AI=Li&#8722;Rb were synthesized by oxidation of cyanides with selenium or by metathesis (AI=Cs). Whereas all reactions proceed in solution, LiSeCN can only be obtained solvent free by ball milling. All compounds were crystallographically characterized, their structures optimized by DFT methods and their vibrational spectra recorded. DSC measurements showed congruent melting and allowed for extraction of the melting points.







Abstract
The full series of quasibinary alkali&#8208;metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (A=Li&#8722;Rb) or by metathesis (A=Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O).

A catalytic domino reduction / imine formation / intramolecular cyclization / oxidation allows the synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles. The reported process employs an inexpensive and nontoxic dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex as catalyst, easily available nitroarenes as starting materials and different glycols as reducing agents with reuse of the waste reduction carbonyl byproduct, which is embodied into the final compounds.







Abstract
A catalytic domino reduction&#8211;imine formation&#8211;intramolecular cyclization&#8211;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of a Synthetic Route to Biaryls by the Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Arylsulfonium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational investigations revealed that, depending on the structure and electronic features of the substrates in the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols, the reaction pathway of the rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangements of the interrupted Pummerer intermediates can vary due to changes in energy synchronicity. As an extreme case, when an electron&#8208;rich phenol is involved, the rearrangement is no longer concerted, but instead stepwise via a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding aryl sulfide and phenoxonium cation.







Abstract
A comprehensive mechanistic investigation was conducted on the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by using trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield biaryls. NMR experiments revealed that our previously proposed mechanism, which consists of a cascade of an interrupted Pummerer reaction and a rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, is reasonable. The electronic effects of the substrates were also evaluated to elucidate the nature of the rearrangement step. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we conclude that the rearrangement is highly asynchronous and stepwise rather than concerted when electron&#8208;rich phenols are employed for the reaction.

         <title>Hybrid Self&#8208;Assembled Gel Beads for Tuneable pH&#8208;Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s all in the delivery: Self&#8208;assembled gel beads have been fabricated using different supramolecular gelators in combination with a calcium alginate polymer gelator and loaded with the statin drug rosuvastatin. The rate of rosuvastatin release is shown to depend on both the pH of the receiving solution and the precise gel bead composition. As such, these gel beads are capable of doubly controlled release.







Abstract
This article describes the fabrication of new pH&#8208;responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;d&#8208;sorbitol: pH&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;COOH and thermally responsive DBS&#8208;CONHNH2, thus clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads by using this approach. We also demonstrate that self&#8208;assembled multicomponent gel beads can be formed by using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS&#8208;COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present upon raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid&#8208;lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH&#8208;dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the pKa of the API. The extent of pH&#8208;mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS&#8208;COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three&#8208;component DBS&#8208;COOH/DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug&#8208;delivery applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&#8242;s all in the delivery&lt;/b&gt;: Self-assembled gel beads have been fabricated using different supramolecular gelators in combination with a calcium alginate polymer gelator and loaded with the statin drug rosuvastatin. The rate of rosuvastatin release is shown to depend on both the pH of the receiving solution and the precise gel bead composition. As such, these gel beads are capable of doubly controlled release.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article describes the fabrication of new pH-responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4-dibenzylidene-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-sorbitol: pH-responsive DBS-COOH and thermally responsive DBS-CONHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads by using this approach. We also demonstrate that self-assembled multicomponent gel beads can be formed by using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS-COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present upon raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid-lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH-dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the API. The extent of pH-mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS-COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three-component DBS-COOH/DBS-CONHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug-delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study of Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin cycle: The IR spectra of molecular platinum fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. PtF4 is formed almost quantitatively under blue light radiation of PtF6, while PtF5 and PtF3 were produced by subsequent UV radiation of PtF4. The coexistence of a singlet and a triplet electronic spin state of PtF4 caused by competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrix.







Abstract
Molecular platinum fluorides PtFn, n=1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF6 embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser&#8208;ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices under cryogenic conditions provide, for the first time, experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF3, PtF4 and PtF5. Photolysis of PtF6 enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF4, whereas both PtF5 and PtF3 were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF4. The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help of one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computation to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF4, for which a spin&#8208;triplet (3B2g, D2h) coexists with an electronic singlet state (1A1g, D4h) in solid neon matrices.

         <title>Analyzing Anisotropic Exchange in a Pentanuclear Os2Ni3 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic properties of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 complex have been calculated from complete active space wave function calculations including spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The calculated anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange interactions in combination with a negative g value for octahedral OsIII centres reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility.







Abstract
Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence&#8208;type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin&#8208;orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a single&#8208;step procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size. The one&#8208;centre parameters (local 
 matrices and single&#8208;ion zero field splitting tensors) are within an expected range, the anisotropic exchange parameters obtained in this work for an Os&#8722;Ni pair are not exceedingly large but determine the low&#8208;T part of the experimental &#967;T curve. Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange coupling constant is 
&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and the D parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange is 
&#8722;1, so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic J (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large&#8208;temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative g value of the Os centres. This negative g value is a universal feature of a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination with 
 configuration and strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN)
 is a versatile building block for the synthesis of 
/
 magnetic materials.

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8722;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic functionalization: The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most important transformations in organic synthesis, but its efficiency depends on its selectivity, which can be controlled by the innate reactivity of the substrate or a directing group. While this last strategy has turned out to be efficient, the directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation. These two undesired synthetic operations can be avoided by using the transient directing group strategy that is comprehensively overviewed in this review article.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8722;H bond, this selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8722;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8722;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are sometimes still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the in&#8197;situ installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8722;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of DFT calculations, we show that the experimental orthorhombic (Pbca) structure of the argentate AgF2, which displays an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order perpendicular to the long axis of the lattice, comes from a cooperative trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion of (AgF6)4&#8722; complexes in a cubic Pa&#8208;3 high&#8208;symmetry reference phase. As a consequence, the system, displaying three equivalent minima, is ferroelastic and displays a strong magneto&#8208;elastic effect that controls the orientation of the AFM order.







Abstract
In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2 and the cuprate La2CuO4. We explored the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2 by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2. Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2 and AgF2. Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2 is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+ ions occupy trigonal sites that, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local E&#8855;e trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+&#8722;F&#8722; bonds increase their distance by 15&#8201;% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors, and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes might be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, these results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2 is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With the help of DFT calculations&lt;/b&gt;, we show that the experimental orthorhombic (&lt;i&gt;Pbca&lt;/i&gt;) structure of the argentate AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which displays an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order perpendicular to the long axis of the lattice, comes from a cooperative trigonal Jahn-Teller distortion of (AgF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complexes in a cubic &lt;i&gt;Pa&lt;/i&gt;-3 high-symmetry reference phase. As a consequence, the system, displaying three equivalent minima, is ferroelastic and displays a strong magneto-elastic effect that controls the orientation of the AFM order.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the search for new high-temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the cuprate La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. We explored the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by studying its parent high-symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Indeed, the parent structure of AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions occupy trigonal sites that, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn-Teller effect. The observed &lt;i&gt;Pbca&lt;/i&gt; orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local E&#8855;e trigonal Jahn-Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bonds increase their distance by 15&#8201;% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors, and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes might be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, these results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn-Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn-Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using an atomic hydrogen source and a supersonic molecular beam of oxygen, the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) was covalently functionalized with molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen. Investigation of the system by high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that only the pores of the nanomesh are functionalized whereas the wires remain unaffected. This selectivity leads to spatially defined chemical functionalization of the corrugated two&#8208;dimensional material. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Papp et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101946).

         <title>Polymorphic Phosphorescence from Separable Aggregates with Unique Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions causing the action: Square planar platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to unique photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated by column chromatography. Solid&#8208;state structures, quantum chemical calculations, concentration&#8208;dependent excitation&#8211;emission spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state emission spectroscopy help to rationalize and shed light on the nature of this phenomenon.







Abstract
Platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to different photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated directly by column chromatography. Solid&#8208;state structures as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirmed the effect of the interactions on the photophysical properties.

         <title>Covalent Patterning of 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach to patterning 2D MoS2 through covalent functionalization of electron beam lithography (EBL)&#8208;defined guiding patterns has been demonstrated by A. Hirsch et al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102021). This approach opens a convenient avenue for spatially designing and engineering MoS2 nanostructures, and would benefit further exploration of MoS2&#8208;based devices and facilitate efficient manufacture.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines through Aryne Three&#8208;Component Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into position: Aryne multicomponent coupling triggered by pyridines allows the broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines bearing a &#8722;CF3 group by engaging &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be used as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway.







Abstract
The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol by using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated. The reaction allowed a broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives bearing the &#8722;CF3 group in good yields with &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway. Nucleophilic attack by the initially generated pyridylidene intermediate on the carbonyl followed by an SNAr process resembling the Smiles rearrangement affords the desired products.

         <dc:description>
New gallate&#8208;TAAILs (imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids) containing the weakly coordinating tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate anion, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8208;, are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications. Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) in combination with different alkyl chain lengths from 1&#8211;12 carbon atoms were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Contrary to the gallate&#8208;TAAIls, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability.







Abstract
We synthesized new imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) with the weakly coordinating tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate anion, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722;. Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) were combined with varying alkyl chain lengths at the imidazolium core leading to TAAILs, which were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity, and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Remarkable low viscosities of 29 cP at 25&#8201;&#176;C for [BMIM][Ga(C2F5)4] were achieved. However, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability, releasing pentafluoroethane at a voltage of 1.5&#8197;V. The 2&#8208;Me&#8208;substituted gallate&#8208;TAAILs slowly decompose over several weeks, whereas all other gallate&#8208;TAAILs showed no decomposition at all. With electrochemical windows of up to 5.15&#8197;V and low viscosities in a range of 66&#8211;162&#8197;cP, the gallate&#8208;TAAILs are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications.

However, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability, releasing pentafluoroethane at a voltage of 1.5&#8197;V. The 2-Me-substituted gallate-TAAILs slowly decompose over several weeks, whereas all other gallate-TAAILs showed no decomposition at all. With electrochemical windows of up to 5.15&#8197;V and low viscosities in a range of 66&#8211;162&#8197;cP, the gallate-TAAILs are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
