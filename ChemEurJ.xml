         <title>Novel Helical Metallocryptand for Size&#8208;Selective Recognition of Amino Acid Derivatives with Aliphatic Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was synthesized, which was found to exist as a pair of P/M helical enantiomers. This LNi3 selectively recognized various amino acid derivatives via non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. The LNi3 metallocryptand also exhibited unique P/M helix inversion preferences depending on the guest side chains, offering potential applications in biochemical sensing and enantioselective detection.








Abstract
The novel tris(salen)&#8208;type metallocryptand, LNi3, was designed and synthesized. Its crystallographic analysis revealed the presence as a helical enantiomeric pair, right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) forms, rather than the meso form, which was energetically supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This LNi3 host was capable of recognizing amino acid derivatives by several non&#8208;covalent interactions, showing a selectivity to those bearing an aliphatic side chain. Its shape&#8208;persistent nature of the cryptand facilitated the size&#8208;based discrimination, which was clearly demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration studies. Recognition of some of the guests caused the emergence of CD signals, indicating the biased P/M helix inversion equilibrium of LNi3. Three aliphatic side&#8208;chain guests, Val, Ile, and Leu, caused an M&#8208;favored shifting, while two &#960;&#8208;containing side&#8208;chain guests, Arg and Trp, showed a preference to the P form. This metallocryptand, LNi3, overcomes the limitation in recognition of less polar amino acids having an alkyl side chain and provides future applications in molecular recognition, biochemical sensing, and enantiomeric sensing.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Aluminum Nanoparticles: Insights from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with varying coordination numbers were synthesized. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals were isolated from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures, and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The coordination number of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x modulates the morphology of Al nanoparticles. AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution.








Abstract
The controlled chemical synthesis of aluminum nanocrystals (Al NCs) is crucial for their applications in plasmonics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics. However, there is still a lack of correlation between the precursor of Al hydride N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (AlH3&#183;(NMP)x) and the Al NC synthesis outcomes. Here, we report the synthesis of AlH3&#183;(NMP)x complexes with different coordination numbers (x from 1.0 to 2.0) and their characterization as precursors regulating the morphology of Al NCs. We isolated AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 single crystals from AlH3&#183;(NMP)x mixtures and successfully elucidated the structure of AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Importantly, AlH3&#183;(NMP)1.0 exhibited the fastest decomposition rate, yielding highly monodisperse Al NCs with well&#8208;defined shapes and the narrowest size distribution, while higher coordination numbers led to increased dispersity in size and irregular morphologies. Additionally, we observed distinct multipole plasmonic resonances in Al NCs synthesized from lower coordination number precursors, highlighting their superior optical properties. This work establishes a direct correlation between precursor coordination chemistry and Al NC synthesis outcomes, providing a foundation for optimizing nanoparticle production for advanced material applications.

         <title>Enhanced Polysulfide Regulation in Rechargeable Li&#8211;S Batteries with ZnS as Electrocatalyst: Experimental Validation and Interfacial Insights from Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnS&#8208;decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@ZnS) composite has been developed as a multifunctional host for the sulfur cathode in rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries. The host exhibits excellent polysulfides adsorption and catalytic conversion during the battery cycling. The experimental results are verified with molecular dynamics simulations, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating polysulfide conversion kinetics.








Abstract
We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (&#8764;80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as an Li&#8211;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8211;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.

         <title>Modulating Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly via Triblock Chiral Patterning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral block patterning influences peptide self&#8208;assembly by directing molecular orientation, which results in distinct morphologies and packing configurations. This alters the gel's mechanical properties, thereby impacting its applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Our research shows that integrating chiral motifs can modify peptide nanostructures, providing flexible strategies for tailoring functional biomaterials.








Abstract
The suprastructural integrity of peptide self&#8208;assemblies is driven by an intricate array of cohesive interactions that guide and maintain a hierarchical order. Seemingly minor alterations to atomic arrangement, such as substitution with D&#8208;amino acids, can dramatically affect assembly potential and resultant architecture. When a primary sequence is comprised of consecutive identical motifs, &#8220;block heterochiral&#8221; peptides can be generated by partitioning chiral inversions according to these underlying elementary units. In this work, we present a combinatorial exploration of all triblock chiral patterns for the model &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide KFE12 (Ac&#8208;(FKFE)3&#8208;NH2). Analysis of the four resulting enantiomer pairs reveals that each produces a unique morphology, ranging from minimal 4&#8208;nm&#8208;wide fibrils to micron&#8208;scale semi&#8208;structured aggregates. Our investigation of these variants illustrates a combination of conserved and divergent hierarchical features, reflecting complex interplay between persistent fundamental forces and the unique spatial implications of blockwise intramolecular chiral interfaces.

         <title>Reactivity of &#948;&#8208;Functionalized para&#8208;Quinone Methides in Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrophilic reactivities of para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) with functional groups at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were determined by photometrical monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in DMSO at 20&#176;C. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N + E), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors E of the pQMs. These electrophilicity parameters E were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the pQM reactions with C&#8208;, H&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters E correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%Vbur). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, %Vbur values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &#948;&#8208;position of the pQMs. Knowledge of MAA and %Vbur thus enables chemists to tailor novel pQMs with predictable reactivity properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent approach towards ADP&#8208;ribosylated&#8208;peptides via a chemoselective phosphate condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is essential for studying the functional implications of this post&#8208;translational modification. While methodologies exist for the chemical synthesis of short oligo&#8208;ADPr fragments and mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides separately, combining the two distinct chemistries, required to assemble them, has remained challenging. In this research, we employ a methodology for the regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of two phosphomonoesters to convergently install the pyrophosphate bond in ADP&#8208;ribosylated constructs. A diverse set of phosphoribosylated peptides, varying in the amino acid acceptor, were prepared and condensed with adenosine monophosphate to yield mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;phase approach was developed to access a phosphoadenosyl&#8208;ADPr fragment, which was used to prepare a di&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide. Overall, the work presented here extends synthetic methodology for the preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via dynamic kinetic resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pillar[n]arenes are a class of emerging supramolecular macrocyclic hosts that have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing dynamic planar chirality and unique cavity structures. In particular, the conformation of pillar[5]arenes can be locked by the introduction of bulky substituents or &#960;&#8208;conjugated units at both rims, resulting in stable planar chirality. This strategy paves the way for the application of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes as versatile chiral molecular platforms. In recent years, planar chiral pillar[5]arenes have been widely applied in various research fields, such as chiral porous materials, chiral luminescence materials, and molecular machines. However, obtaining planar chiral pillar[5]arenes in enantiomeric forms remains a significant challenge. Recently, asymmetric catalytic synthesis via dynamic kinetic resolution has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes. This concept summarizes these achievements and highlights the design principles and key challenges associated with these strategies, aiming to provide valuable insights for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of PTCTA/ZnO Composite Films for Acetic Acid Vapor Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents PTCTA/ZnO composite films for efficient room&#8208;temperature acetic acid sensing. The enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the synergistic effects of the formation of p&#8208;n heterojunction effect and the porous structure of PTCTA/ZnO composite.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor sensors based on zinc oxide (ZnO) and its composites are found to be very sensitive in detecting acetic acid vapor. However, its operating temperatures usually exceed 200&#160;&#176;C. In this work, an environmentally friendly and controllable electrochemical approach for constructing poly(4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine) (PTCTA) and ZnO composite films was successfully obtained for acetic acid sensing at room temperature. The conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films of PTCTA were synthesized via an electropolymerization (EP) method using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;Tris(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;triphenylamine (TCTA) molecule as a precursor. Subsequently, ZnO was deposited in situ to fabricate homogeneous PTCTA/ZnO composite films. The resulting PTCTA/ZnO composite films achieved a response value of 2.42 for 200&#160;ppm acetic acid vapor at room temperature, which was significantly outperforming standalone PTCTA or ZnO films. This enhanced sensing capability was attributed to the porous structure, the synergistic effects of the p&#8208;n heterojunction at the PTCTA/ZnO interface and the oxygen adsorption/desorption occurring on the ZnO surface. What's more, PTCTA/ZnO composite films demonstrated structural stability and flexibility. The results suggested that the developed novel PTCTA/ZnO composite films showed great potential for acetic acid determination.

         <title>On the Importance of Balancing the pKa of the Additive in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the irreversible tautomerization of imine linkages to their corresponding ketoenamines, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are a stable type of COF that displays high surface areas. In the solvothermal synthesis of such COFs, the use of (acetic) acid is ubiquitous. However, the effect of the added acid on the COF properties (notably their surface area) has never been investigated. Building on an extensive literature overview, we systematically studied the effect of the pKa of several added acids on COF performance characteristics, and extended the investigation by including a series of (organo&#8208;)bases with varying pKa. Interestingly, the highest BET surface areas, above 1400 m2/g, were found in the alkaline region of the pKa window, with a maximum near pKa ~10.8 for triethylamine and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine. Considering the pKa values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which will optimize the reaction rate of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.</dc:description>

Building on an extensive literature overview, we systematically studied the effect of the pKa of several added acids on COF performance characteristics, and extended the investigation by including a series of (organo-)bases with varying pKa. Interestingly, the highest BET surface areas, above 1400 m2/g, were found in the alkaline region of the pKa window, with a maximum near pKa ~10.8 for triethylamine and N,N-diisopropylethylamine. Considering the pKa values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which will optimize the reaction rate of the &#946;-ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;-ketoenamine-linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation, Photoluminescence, and Cytotoxicity of Pt(II) and Re(I) Complexes Bearing Multimodal&#8208;Coordinating Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polydentate ligand with multiple coordination patterns (bidentate N*N&#8208;mode for Pt(II) and Re(I) centers, tridentate C^N*N&#8208;motive for Pt(II)&#8208;based complexes) is herein presented. The attained coordination&#8208;chemical versatility in combination with different co&#8208;ligands was employed to achieve sophisticated structural features and tunable photophysical properties, including&#160;aggregation and cytotoxicity.








Abstract
In this study, a polydentate ligand capable of adopting multiple coordination modes (N*N, C^N*N, and C^N*N^C) was established. Depending on the chelation conditions and the co&#8208;ligand used in the subsequent steps, nine complexes became accessible. The four Pt(II)&#8208;based species with N*N&#8208;coordination motif show tunable emission and cytotoxicity. Two Pt(II) complexes with C^N*N&#8208;type coordination were also obtained, and the exchange of the co&#8208;ligand from chlorido to cyanido led to an enhancement in the photoluminescence quantum yield from &lt;0.02 to 0.55. These compounds exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state characteristics associated with Pt&#8943;Pt&#8208;interactions. Interestingly, the tetradentate C^N*N^C&#8208;coordination mode was not accessible, most likely due to kinetic reasons and insolubility&#8208;related purification hurdles. However, the use of a N*N&#8208;coordination mode for a Re(I) center yielded non&#8208;cytotoxic 3MLCT&#8208;state emitters. The multifaceted coordination modes available with the luminophoric ligand enable the design and realization of diverse metal complexes with tailored cytotoxicity and tendency towards intermolecular coupling, both in solution and in crystalline phases.

         <title>Effect of the Entanglement of Microporous Pillared MOFs on the Uptake and Release Profiles of Essential Oil Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two differently entangled pillared MOFs with similar chemical compositions but different flexibility were compared for their guest uptake/release capacity. The flexible interpenetrated MOF shows superior host&#8208;guest propensity with respect to the polycatenated one.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of coordination polymers known for their intrinsic porosity. This property, combined with their ability to exhibit some degree of flexibility, makes them ideal materials for various innovative applications, like the inclusion and controlled release of active compounds for active packaging and agricultural applications. This study aimed to characterize the uptake and release behavior of an equimolar mixture of two phenolic essential oils (EOs), that is, carvacrol (CAR) and thymol (THY), encapsulated in two microporous Zn&#8208;based MOFs with different entanglement motifs: PUM168 is threefold interpenetrated and flexible, while PUM210 is fourfold polycatenated and rigid (PUM = Parma University Materials). The guest uptake was calculated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis, whereas the release profiles were investigated via headspace gas chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (HS&#8208;GC&#8208;MS) (Headspace&#8208;Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass&#8208;Spectrometry) analysis over a period of 15 days at room temperature. The monitoring revealed the superior ability of the flexible PUM168 for a stable and prolonged release of the volatile components, while the release from the rigid PUM210 was completed within 24 hours.

         <title>Small Molecule Donor/Polymer Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 13.65% Enabled by Film Formation Kinetics and Phase Separation Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (SD/PA&#8208;type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focus on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lack of study. In this work, we apply three polymerized non&#8208;fullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor induce the donor to adopt a face&#8208;on packing; under the similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT&#8208;C3&#8208;D6:PY2S&#8208;F&#8208;based SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with the best miscibility achieves an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Donor Engineering for High&#8208;Efficiency Orange&#8208;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary donor positional engineering at the C2 and C3 positions of a NAI&#8211;DMAc core yields efficient orange&#8209;red TADF emitters. The C3&#8209;isomer ND37DBT exhibits enhanced spin orbit coupling and RISC processes, achieving 70% PLQY. and 22.1% EQE in solution&#8209;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).








Abstract
Achieving efficient orange&#8208;red emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains challenging due to the hard to achieve great balance between a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and high radiative decay rates. In this study, a modification site engineering strategy for secondary donors to optimize excited&#8208;state properties for orange&#8208;red emitters is proposed. Two isomeric emitters, ND28DBT and ND37DBT, were synthesized by introducing dibenzothiophene (DBT) units at different positions of a naphthalimide&#8211;dimethylacridine (NAI&#8211;DMAc) core. The theoretical analysis indicates that ND37DBT possesses a more favorable excited&#8208;state configuration, which facilitates an efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and accelerates the radiative decay rate. As a result, ND37DBT showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (70%), a fast RISC rate (6.25&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1), and an excellent external quantum efficiency (EQE) (22.1%) with minimal roll&#8208;off in 100 cd m&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that precise control of secondary donor modification sites offers a powerful molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;efficiency orange&#8208;red TADF materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Triphosphaallyl Cation Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

Imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted triphosphaallyl cations undergo selective P&#8211;C bond cleavage and form unprecedented bicyclic P&#8323;&#8208;Ga scaffolds with unique reactivity.









Abstract
Reduction of the triphosphaallyl species 6[GaCl4] with GaI[Ga2Cl7] affords the imidazoliumyl&#8208;substituted (L) bicyclo[2.1.1]&#8208;triphosphane 10[Ga2Cl7], featuring an unprecedented Ga2Cl5&#8208;bridged P3 scaffold. Reactions of 10[Ga2Cl7] with nucleophiles (Cl&#8722; or NHC) result in rare, selective P&#8211;C bond cleavages, affording Ga2Cly&#8208;substituted triphosphiranes (LP3Ga2Cly, y = &#160;5, 6) via an intramolecular ring closure mechanism. Protonation of 6[GaCl4] gives rise to a similar ring closure, but without P&#8211;C bond cleavage, to afford the L2P3H+ salt 8[OTfGaCl3]2. Additionally, the palladium complex 26[GaCl4], formed through the reaction of 10[Ga2Cl7] with [Pd(PPh3)4], presents a novel bicyclic P3Pd moiety (LP3Pd(PPh3)2[GaCl4]). Comprehensive DFT calculations have been conducted to elucidate the bonding situation in 26[GaCl4], uncovering significant metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation and a distinctive 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron hyperbonding phenomenon in the P&#8323;Pd framework. These findings offer valuable insights into chemistry of cyclic polyphosphorus compounds and, in particular, the reactivity, structural flexibility, and the coordination properties of cationic triphosphorus species.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Vibration and Liquefaction of Flexible and Naturally Bent Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine and long&#8208;chain fatty acids exhibit versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive properties: UV&#8208;induced rapid vibration, temporary photoliquefaction, and mechanical deformation. These remarkable photo&#8208;responsive properties arise from photoisomerization and photothermal effects, whereas flexible molecular packing enabled by long alkyl chains imparts deformability.








Abstract
Single crystals obtained by cocrystallization of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine with long&#8208;chain fatty acids, viz. lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid, exhibit a variety of light&#8208;responsive properties. The molecular arrangement of the cocrystal components in the crystal structure, coupled with the flexibility of the long alkyl chains and the presence of the azo group, enables the elastic and plastically deformable crystals to demonstrate light responsiveness, which manifests as bending, vibration, and liquefaction. The photoresponses arise from two primary mechanisms: the photoisomerization of azopyridine groups within the crystal lattice and the photothermal effect that generates localized heat under UV light. Consequently, the single crystals display reversible bending and vibrational motion in response to on/off light cycles, as well as temporary liquefaction of the crystalline materials when exposed to higher&#8208;intensity UV light. The arrangement of the long alkyl chains and the presence of weak interactions within the crystal structure impart deformability to the single crystals while lowering melting points. This work illustrates how adaptive crystalline materials can be developed by modulating the crystal structure of light&#8208;sensitive molecular components through non&#8208;covalent synthesis.

         <title>Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Alkyl Alcohols and Amines Facilitated by Dearomative Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heteroaromatic alkyl alcohols and amines are inherently unstable in acidic and/or basic solution due to an irreversible dehydrogenation that proceeds from a minority tautomer. In many cases, this reaction results in quantitative oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde, providing a simple, convenient, and green approach for preparing versatile synthetic building blocks.








Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols, amines, and halides is a fundamental transformation in organic chemistry with significant applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Here we show that a broad variety of N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, or halomethyl groups are oxidatively dehydrogenated to their respective aldehydes by simply heating them in acidic or basic aqueous solution under ambient atmosphere. The quantitative oxidation of 9&#8208;acridinemethanol to 9&#8208;acridinecarboxaldehyde serves as an illustrative example, proceeding to completion within 3&#160;hours in refluxing 5% aqueous acetic acid or even household vinegar. Quinoline derivatives may be similarly oxidized but require higher temperatures and longer reaction times, while indole derivatives are oxidized under basic conditions. Based on comprehensive regioselectivity screens, internal kinetic isotope competition, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which migration of a methylene hydrogen to the pyridinic nitrogen by acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative tautomerization yields an unstable enol or enamine intermediate that then irreversibly loses two hydrogen atoms to atmospheric oxygen. In addition to the simplicity and environmentally benign nature of our method, we observe no indication of any over&#8208;oxidation to carboxylic acids. Finally, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of this reaction through two different one&#8208;pot formylations of acridine.

         <title>Effect of Chalcogen Interaction on the Structure of Methine&#8208;Bridged Trichalcogenophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemistry of methine&#8208;bridged trichalcogenophenes was elucidated through comprehensive structural analyses. Trithiophene showed a strong preference for the ZZ configuration, whereas its trifuran analog exhibited a near&#8208;statistical distribution of geometric isomers. X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies revealed that intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding stabilizes the ZZ configuration.








Abstract
Polythienylenemethylidenes (PTMs) are promising conjugated polymers for organic electronics owing to their narrow bandgaps and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, their stereochemistry remains unexplored. In this study, methine&#8208;bridged trithiophene and trifuran analogs were synthesized to investigate stereochemistry and chalcogen bonding effects. The compounds were obtained as mixtures of ZZ, EZ(= ZE), and EE geometric isomers, established through detailed NMR analyses. At thermal equilibrium, the ZZ isomer predominated in trithiophene (ZZ:(EZ&#160;+&#160;ZE):EE&#160;=&#160;58:35:6), whereas trifuran showed a near&#8208;statistical distribution. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding in trithiophene with S&#183;&#183;&#183;S distances (&#8776;3.04 &#197;) shorter than van der Waals radii and C&#8211;S&#183;&#183;&#183;S angles of 171&#176;. Comprehensive conformer searches and DFT calculations not only validated the higher stability of the ZZ isomer in trithiophene but also provided calculated isomer distributions that closely matched the experimental values. Multi&#8208;faceted computational analysis (electron localization function (ELF), noncovalent interaction (NCI), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and natural bond orbital (NBO))&#160;confirmed the presence of these chalcogen&#8208;centered interactions and quantified their strength through lone pair (LP)(S)&#8594;&#963;*(S&#8211;C) donor&#8208;acceptor orbital interactions. Trithiophene exhibited a unique dual&#8208;chalcogen bonding mode in the ZZ configuration. These findings elucidate the role of chalcogen bonding in stabilizing ZZ&#8208;trithiophenes and contribute to designing PTMs with controlled stereochemistry for organic electronics applications.

         <title>Divergent Responses of Carbon Nitride Dot&#8208;Based Amorphous Species and Small Molecule Hybrids to Trace Level Analytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bottom&#8208;up synthesis method using hydrothermal reaction of CA and U to produce CNDs with controllable properties. The approach yields two distinct fractions: polycrystalline small&#8208;molecule hybrids and amorphous CNDs. The research investigates how these different species affect explosive detection capabilities, providing insights for optimizing sensing applications through controlled synthesis conditions.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nitride dots (CNDs) offers a versatile platform for the creation of diverse nanomaterials with tunable properties. Here, we report a facile hydrothermal approach using citric acid (CA) and urea (U) as precursors to synthesize CNDs with varying degrees of condensation and crystallinity. By carefully controlling reaction conditions and post&#8208;synthetic treatments, we obtained two distinct fractions: a polycrystalline fraction composed of small&#8208;molecule hybrids and an amorphous fraction containing CNDs. We then sought to understand how the dominant species in these fractions impact sensing abilities using trace&#8208;level explosive exemplars. The results have important implications for sensing and related applications where understanding the complex interplay between synthetic conditions and post&#8208;synthetic processing play vital roles in determining the final properties of CND materials.

         <title>Review of Metal Nitrides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Design, Mechanisms, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article explores the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries enhanced by metal nitrides, detailing the synthesis methods, morphological characteristics, and size&#8208;dependent effects. It also discusses underlying design principles for metal nitrides and outlines future directions for their application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSB) emerge as the next generation battery technology owing to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, sluggish redox reactions coupled with severe volume alterations result in underachievement of the merits. Additionally, the atrocious shuttle effect prompts premature failure, thereby limiting life cycle count. Transition metal nitrides with excellent properties, including good electrical conductivity and catalytic effects, have been investigated as functional materials to address the challenges of LSB. Mainly, transition metal nitrides as well as their composites have been employed as hosts and interlayers to boost reaction kinetics and enhance the cycle life. This review focuses on the fundamental mechanisms of metal nitrides toward the capture and catalysis of polysulfides. The article highlights battery performance attained with key metal nitrides with the inclusion of the synthesis procedures, morphology, and size effects. Further, the possible principles for the design of metal nitrides, along with future directions, are discussed.

         <title>Cyanomethylation of Aldehydes on an Electrochemical Microflow System and Utility of Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Examination of the Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical cyanomethylation reaction was developed. Using the electrochemical microflow reactor enables the reaction to yield almost exclusively products. To find the best reaction conditions, we used the Gaussian process regression (GPR), and the flow rates and the current values were explored. Our cyanomethylation was completed with a semi&#8208;catalytic electrical input, and the mechanism was discussed based on cyclic voltammetry (CV) and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds affords a &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile, which is very useful in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Although several electrochemical methods have also been reported to achieve cyanomethylation of carbonyl compounds, dehydration as a major side reaction is a significant issue that needs to be prevented. An electrochemical flow reactor, free from side reactions through rapid removal of the reaction solution from the electrode surface, enables the electrochemical cyanomethylation of aldehydes in acetonitrile without any dehydrated side products. To find the &#8220;best&#8221; reaction conditions for each starting material, we used machine learning (ML) models. In addition, comparing the ML models constructed using various molecular descriptors contributed to understanding the critical molecular properties to proceed the electrochemical cyanomethylation. Our cyanomethylation using a flow system went to completion with a semi&#8208;catalytic amount of electrical input, which is not consistent with the conventional basic mechanism, and DFT calculations suggest a radical mechanism.

         <title>Perspectives of Soft Lattice Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts, Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in LFPMs. By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this Perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Folding of Azobenzene Derivatives with Axial Chirality and Chirality Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding of photoisomerism effect on the chiral transportation occurred intra&#8208; and intermolecularly shall facilitates the fabrication of smart chiroptical materials for sensing, recognition and display. Here we present the photoisomerization enabled molecular folding and chirality transportation. Azobenzene core is conjugated with two chiral arms comprising of amino acid segments. The substituted position including ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positioned substituents affects the formation of intramolecular interactions, leading to distinct adaptiveness towards the solvent media. The trans&#8208;cis isomerism of azobenzene allows for the reversible manipulation of chiroptical properties, accompanied by the appearance of axial chirality. The ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzene can form folded structures stabilized by intramolecular CH&#8208;&#960; interactions in trans&#8208;form, while in the cis&#8208;form, the conformation is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen in the amide segment. Structural transformations induced by solvent and light irradiation were revealed through density&#8208;functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based computational studies and experimental results. This work unveils the photoisomerization effect on folding, and achieves reversible conformational changes and chirality inversion, showing potential for constructing advanced smart chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Organic Solvents Enable Stable Zn Anodes via Simultaneous Electrolyte Structure and Interface Chemistry Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Zn stands as an exceptionally promising anode material for aqueous batteries due to its inherent safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, its widespread application has been severely limited by persistent challenges, including water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and uncontrolled dendritic growth. Herein, a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system with modulated bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry has been developed to address the above obstacles, featuring Zn trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) dissolved in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DX). In such system, DME can effectively disrupt the hydrogen bond network of water molecules through its electron&#8208;donating properties, thereby significantly suppressing water activity and associated side reactions, while DX preferentially adsorbs at the anode/electrolyte interface to facilitate Zn2+ desolvation and promote the preferential growth of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn crystals. The optimized electrolyte system endows Zn anodes with exceptional electrochemical performance, demonstrating unprecedented cycling stability (4000 hours at 1 mA cm  &#8211;   2  /1 mAh cm  &#8211;   2  ) in the Zn//Zn cell and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99.8% over 2000 cycles) in the Zn//Cu cell. Moreover, the full battery paired with Na2V6O16 demonstrates excellent cycling stability with 79.0% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Stabilized Bisacylgermylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, a metal&#8208;free synthetic approach towards isolable bisacylgermylenes, a novel class of germylenes, is described. Starting from tetra(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 1 and bromo&#8208;tris(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 3, we demonstrate that simple treatment with NHCs leads to two distinct types of reactivity: acyl abstraction and germylene stabilization. Reaction of 1 with NHCs produces imidazolium&#8208;substituted germenolates 2a,b via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. In contrast, compound 3 undergoes stepwise substitution to afford isolable NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b, which were structurally characterized by NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The UV/Vis spectra of 4a,b shows two absorption bands in the visible region of the light, which do not overlap and have different characters. Reactivity studies revealed its nucleophilic character and resulted in the formation of several germylene/iron and germylene/boron complexes. The removal of the NHC at room temperature with triphenylborane leads to a degradation, mainly based on the instability of the unstabilized bisacylgermylene. To determine its reactivity, an alternative synthetic strategy was developed based on the reaction of the geminal bisgermenolates 7 with the bischloro&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;germane 9. Trapping reactions with NHCs results in the formation of 4a,b in near quantitative yields. This work expands the synthetic scope of main group low&#8208;valent chemistry and introduces germylenes with tunable reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Low Oxidation State Paradigm is more Consistent with XFEL Observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; Transition in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic water splitting catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5/6 cluster in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) is crucial for sustaining the supply of oxygen on Earth. A recent serial femtosecond X&#8208;ray crystallography (XFEL) study has provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics of the OEC during the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition, revealing that this process involves a peroxide intermediate formed via oxo&#8208;oxyl radical coupling between O5 and Ox. However, computational models based on the high oxidation state (HOS) paradigm have failed to explain key XFEL observations, including the apparent loss of Ox upon peroxide formation and the largely unchanged Mn4&#8211;O5 distance from S&#8324; to the peroxide intermediate. Here, we apply density functional theory to remodel the S4 &#8594; S0 transition within the low oxidation state (LOS) paradigm and show that this model yields results more consistent with the XFEL observations. Notably, this study demonstrates that the LOS paradigm can support the formation of an oxyl species essential for O&#8208;O coupling and subsequent O2 generation, a capability previously thought to be exclusive to the HOS model. &#160;Our findings offer an alternative explanation that complements existing models and broadens our understanding of the OEC mechanism</dc:description>

         <title>Front Cover: Integrating Electrochemical Electrodes Into Mass Spectrometry Ionization Sources for Detection of Transient Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover showcases a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; configuration for electrochemistry&#8211;mass spectrometry designed to detect transient intermediates with lifetimes ranging from seconds to milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, and even picoseconds. The integration strategies for combining the electrode and ion source are explored, focusing on leveraging inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode systems, and utilizing bipolar electrodes. More information can be found in the Review by Z. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404646).

         <title>Cover Feature: Electrochemical Fabrication of Nanoparticles and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Cathodic Corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates cathodic corrosion as a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts from bulk metal wires. By tuning experimental conditions, this clean and affordable approach enables precise control over nanoparticle shapes and sizes without surfactants. The Review by M.&#160;M. Elnagar, L.&#160;A. Kibler and Timo Jacob (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500036) highlights recent advances in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, focusing on its unique capabilities and the superior (photo)electrocatalytic performance of the resulting nanomaterials.

         <title>Cover Feature: A Copper(I) Catenane Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Layer as a Heterogenous Catalyst for Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature is a representation of a metal&#8211;organic layer (honeycomb&#8208;like structure in white and yellow) decorated with CuI catenane complexes (interlocked purple rings) as a heterogenous catalyst for the dehydrogenative C&#8211;O coupling of phenols and bromodicarbonyls (black stick structures). Due to the restricted yet dynamic coordination environment within the catenane ligand, undesired Cu oxidation is effectively inhibited, thus promoting a highly efficient and selective catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#160;Y. Au&#8208;Yeung and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500866).

         <title>Molecular Hybrid Photocatalysts for CO2 Photoreduction by Hybridization of Molecular Catalysts and Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the hybridization and immobilization strategies of molecular catalysts for CO2 photoreduction on semiconducting covalent organic frameworks, in the absence of additional photosensitizers. The ligand scaffolds of the molecular catalytic motifs involving porphyrin, (poly)pyridine, and salen structures have been discussed for covalent or non&#8208;covalently immobilized examples. Last, future challenges and opportunities are discussed and summarized.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to obtain storable fuels is an effective way to fix and utilize greenhouse gas CO2, ultimately achieving a carbon&#8208;free energy cycle. The core of this goal lies the development of efficient, sustainable, and economically practical catalysts and light absorbers. Currently, hybrid photocatalytic systems that immobilize molecular catalysts on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of intensified interest, as this strategy enables the simultaneous exploitation of the catalytic properties of high&#8208;performance molecular catalysts, together with the durability of heterogeneous semiconductors, based on the readily available synthetic tunability of both components. This review focuses on the significant progress and challenges that have been overcome for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, mediated by COFs hybridized with molecular catalysts, aiming to provide strong guidance for innovative utilization towards sustainable photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the future.

         <title>Integrating Electrochemical Electrodes into Mass Spectrometry Ionization Sources for Detection of Transient Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; configuration for electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry has proven to be powerful in detecting transient intermediates with lifetimes from second, milli&#8208;, micro&#8208;, to nano&#8208;, and even pico&#8208;seconds. This mini&#8208;review addresses the electrode&#8208;ion source integration strategies, mainly including exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes.








Abstract
Identifying short&#8208;lived transient intermediates is challenging due to their brief lifetimes (as short as nanoseconds and even picoseconds) and therefore low concentrations in many chemical processes. Conducting electrochemical reactions within mass spectrometry ion sources (i.e., in&#8208;source or in situ EC&#8208;MS) offers the advantage of minimizing the distance between the electrodes and the mass spectrometer, thereby improving the detection of transient intermediates. However, a key challenge for in&#8208;source EC&#8208;MS is the effective integration of the electrodes into the MS ion sources. This mini&#8208;review highlights three main integration strategies: exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, experimental setups, and applications of these approaches. Future perspectives emphasize the directions of designing and modifying ionization sources, integrating electrocatalysis, enhancing transfer efficiency, developing automated screening platforms, as well as expanding practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Identifying short-lived transient intermediates is challenging due to their brief lifetimes (as short as nanoseconds and even picoseconds) and therefore low concentrations in many chemical processes. Conducting electrochemical reactions within mass spectrometry ion sources (i.e., in-source or in situ EC-MS) offers the advantage of minimizing the distance between the electrodes and the mass spectrometer, thereby improving the detection of transient intermediates. However, a key challenge for in-source EC-MS is the effective integration of the electrodes into the MS ion sources.

         <title>Aqueous Catalytic Olefin Polymerization With Nickel and Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions could yield considerable economic benefits. This review focuses on Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures. The preparation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocrystals and the modulation of polymer morphology are highlighted.








Abstract
Polyolefins are extensively used in modern society, with hydrocarbon organic compounds traditionally serving as solvents for their preparation. Water, as a reaction medium, offers significant advantages, including non&#8208;flammability, non&#8208;toxicity, high specific heat capacity, and strong polarity. A promising avenue of research involves replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions, which could yield considerable economic benefits. Among the various transition metal catalysts used to synthesize polyolefins, late&#8208;transition metal catalysts, such as Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts, demonstrate enhanced tolerance to polar groups, making them particularly suitable for aqueous polymerization of olefins. This review focuses on the Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for the aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures. The preparation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocrystals and the modulation of polymer morphology are highlighted. The possible development trend of aqueous catalytic polymerization is envisioned to achieve the development concept of environmental protection and the needs of industrial production.

         <title>Electrochemical Fabrication of Nanoparticles and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Cathodic Corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>

While cathodic corrosion can be detrimental to electrode surfaces, it has emerged as a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts from bulk wires. This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advancements in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, focusing on its unique capabilities and the superior (photo)electrocatalytic performance of the resulting nanomaterials.







Abstract
While cathodic corrosion may appear as an undesired degradation process at electrode surfaces, it has become a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts. In contrast to traditional wet chemical synthesis, cathodic corrosion affords rapid, straightforward, capping&#8208;agent&#8208;free production of nanoparticles, enabling fine control over size, shape, and elemental composition. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advances in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, emphasizing its unique capabilities for producing metallic, alloyed, and oxide nanoparticles, as well as single&#8208;atom catalysts. It explores the effects of varying parameters such as electrode material, electrolyte composition, voltage waveform, and frequency on the characteristics of the generated particles. Furthermore, it highlights the enhanced electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles produced via cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Extrudable Thermosets Based on Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) hold significant promise for the development of high&#8208;performance materials. However, their compatibility with contemporary mass production and processing techniques, such as extrusion, presents a considerable challenge. This review discusses the design principles and overviews the recent advancements in extrudable thermosets derived from DCPs, while also addressing the associated challenges, future prospects, and potential applications.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) have attracted considerable attention for fabricating self&#8208;healing, recyclable, adaptive, and malleable thermosets. However, their processing has largely depended on compression molding, which requires extended time due to the crosslinked nature of these materials. This limitation poses significant challenges for applications in continuous processes like extrusion, a technique highly valued in industry for producing long, uninterrupted products. Recently, continuous processing methods for DCPs have emerged, offering the potential to streamline their production by providing scalability and consistency&#8208;factors that could transform sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. Yet, developing extrudable DCPs remains a complex task, demanding the precise design of dynamic crosslinks with rapid kinetics, high thermal stability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, all while ensuring compatibility with suitable molecular backbones. In this review, we summarize the key requirements for designing extrudable DCPs and discuss recent advancements in continuous processing techniques aligned with various design strategies. We also highlight the challenges and outline future directions for optimizing high&#8208;performance DCP extrusion, aiming to offer a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals looking to leverage these techniques.

This review focuses on polyvalent nucleic acid&#8208;based nanosystems and their biomedical applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for the rational establish of smart polyvalent nucleic acid nanosystems with robust functionalities for facilitated tumor diagnosis and therapy applications.








Abstract
Nucleic acids, as essential biomacromolecules, have garnered considerable scientific interest in diagnosis and therapy owing to their unique molecular characteristics, including sequence&#8208;specific programmability, precise molecular recognition capabilities, and diverse biological functionalities. In recent years, with the deepening of the understanding of the physicochemical properties of nucleic acids and the development of nanotechnology, nucleic acid&#8208;based nanoprobes with sophisticated structures and functions have been gradually developed, opening up a new direction for efficient diagnosis, followed by customized therapy for diseases. Despite the progress, the affinity and stability of nucleic acids to target sites still suffer from severe challenges, especially in complex physiological environments. Polyvalent nucleic acids, integrated with different functional elements, have demonstrated enormous advantages in effectively solving the above limitations by the elaborate design and construction of multifunctional DNA nanostructures, making them promising candidates for smart&#8208;responsive nanoprobes. In this review, we commence with an exploration of nucleic acids, subsequently delineating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for the fabrication of polyvalent nucleic acid nanostructures. We then predominantly underscore the latest advancements in these nanostructures as innovative platforms for cancer theranostics. Further, we critically examine the biomedical applications of polyvalent nucleic acids, alongside addressing the prevailing challenges and future prospects in the realm of nucleic acid&#8208;facilitated diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Excited State Branching Processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced electron transfer processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;based push&#8211;pull&#8211;push architecture which combines an inorganic and organic chromophore are elucidated in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach. The applied design concept allows the excited state to be localized away from the metal onto the organic chromophore.








Abstract
Excited state properties such as excitation energy, accessibility of the respective excited state either by direct or indirect population transfer, and its lifetime govern the application of these excited states in light&#8208;driven reactions, for example, photocatalysis using transition metal complexes. Compared with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) states, charge&#8208;separated (3CS) excited states involving organic moieties, such as triplet intra&#8208;ligand or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3ILCT and 3LLCT) states, tend to possess longer&#8208;lived excited states due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling with the closed&#8208;shell ground state. Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic chromophores enables isolating the triplet states onto the organic chromophore. In this study, we aim to elucidate the excited&#8208;state relaxation processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;terpyridyl donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor system (RuCl) in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical simulations and dissipative quantum dynamics. The electron transfer (ET) processes involving the low&#8208;lying 3MLCT, 3ILCT, and 3LLCT excited states were investigated experimentally and computationally within a semiclassical Marcus picture. Finally, dissipative quantum dynamical simulations&#8212;capable of describing incomplete ET processes involving all three states&#8212;enabled us to unravel the competitive relaxation channels at short and long timescales among the strongly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3ILCT states and weakly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3LLCT and 3ILCT&#8208;3LLCT states.

         <title>Higher BODIPY Homologues&#8211;Synthesis, Reactivity, and Photoluminescence Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher homologues of the well&#8208;known BODIPY dyes for boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium are described. These have been obtained with the halogen substituents chlorine, bromine, and iodine and as mixed substituted compounds with methyl and halogen substituents. The optical properties are described as well as the observation of excimers.








Abstract
The synthesis of MesDPM group 13 (B&#9472;In, MesDPM&#160;=&#160;1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene) compounds with halide substituents (Cl&#9472;I) is described. All compounds were fully characterized including NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. In addition, the solid state molecular structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As higher representatives of BODIPY (boron difluoride dipyrromethene) dyes, some of these MesDPM triel dihalides also exhibit an intense green fluorescence when exposed to sunlight. In this regard, the optical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy giving absorption maxima around 520&#160;nm and fluorescence emission in the range between 550 and 660&#160;nm. Fluorescence quantum efficiencies up to 42% could be obtained from measurements in toluene solution. Further, reactivity studies were carried out which opened&#8208;up access to mixed substituted MesDPM triels with one alkyl and one halide substituent.

         <title>Crystal Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of the cis&#8208;Eunicellane Cyclase AriE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of a cis&#8208;eunicellane cyclase, AriED128A, was determined through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis explored the cyclization mechanism of AriE, in which W73 is a crucial regulatory hotspot that controls product diversity through cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our research provides the first structural insights into eunicellane cyclases and demonstrates the potential of engineering variants for selective product formation.








Abstract
Eunicellane diterpenoids, with over 360 known examples characterized by a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;6/10&#8208;bicyclic carbon skeleton, exhibit diverse biological activities. To date, five eunicellane cyclases (ECs) have been reported: cis&#8208;ECs (Bnd4, CpDTS2 and EcTPS1) and trans&#8208;ECs (AlbS and MicA), yet the structural basis and molecular mechanisms governing their distinct cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;cyclization modes remain unsolved. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cis&#8208;EC AriE from Amycolatopsis arida, which catalyzes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form cis&#8208;6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene (1) in aridacin biosynthesis. Through surface entropy reduction, we obtained the 1.87 &#197; resolution structure of AriED128A. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis identified W73 as a key regulatory hotspot controlling product diversity, with its variants generating diverse diterpene products. Y203A converted AriE into a highly specific (&#8211;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;cembrene A synthase. Our findings provide the first structural insights into this type of terpene synthase and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering EC variants for selective product formation.

         <title>Simple Large&#8208;Scale Preparation of Carbon Dot Composites with High Luminescent Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study describes the large&#8208;scale preparation of carbon dot composites. These composites have high deep blue fluorescence quantum yield and long green phosphorescence which can be used as deep blue LEDs and advanced digital encryption. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of the structures of the composites are proposed.








Abstract

         <title>From Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ligands to Smart Coordination Polymers: Cyanothiazole&#8208;Cu(I) Complexes for Multifunctional Electronic Devices</title>

Cyanothiazoles, paired with copper(I) iodide, form complexes with luminescent properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed two types of coordination polymers, while spectroscopic, synchrotron, and electric measurements supported by density functional (DFT) calculations studies highlighted their unique electronic features, offering a foundation for future research.








Abstract
Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine&#8208;tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;chalcogen I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8211;Vis) spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.

An elegant method described for the construction of fused pyrrole rings via palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of aryl iodides 10 with acetylenic substrates 8/9, leading to a general synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles 1 and pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles 2 through 11/12.

Abstract
We report an elegant method for the construction of fused pyrrole rings via palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of aryl iodides with N&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynylated 3&#8208;aminobenzofurans/3&#8208;aminoindoles leading to the general synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles/pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles via 3&#8208;(arylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro intermediates. Exposing the intermediates to 2,3&#8208;Dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) delivered benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (BFIs) and indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (IIs) containing vicinal cyano groups. These transformations constitute a rapid intermolecular assembly through several carbon&#160;&#8722;&#160;carbon bond forming reactions, involving a single electron transfer (SET) process in the crucial steps. Photophysical studies of selected products identified promising candidates for future applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Aggregation of Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis and characterization of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide dyads with varying sterically demanding side groups. The dyads strongly assemble in basic aqueous solutions, resulting in fully quenched fluorescence. Tracking the individualization through tetrahydrofuran (THF) by UV/Vis spectroscopy revealed stronger porphyrin&#8208;porphyrin interactions for meso&#8208;free dyads. STEM and DLS measurements supported by DFT models reveal micellular structures, as well as larger liposomes and agglomerates.








Abstract
We report the straightforward synthesis of a family of amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) dyads containing sterically demanding substituents at the porphyrin meso&#8208;position, as well as at the PBI bay&#8208;position. The hydrophilic head group consists of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid G2&#8208;Newkome dendrons attached to the porphyrin, whereas lipophilic pentyl&#8208;hexyl&#8208;swallowtails are connected to the PBI imide position. Using UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, their tetrahydrofuran (THF) initiated disaggregation was studied in aqueous media. Without meso&#8208;substituents, a stronger interaction between the porphyrins was observed in the aggregated state. Insights into the size and morphology of the aggregates were obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these revealed micelles and liposomes as plausible architectures.

         <title>Exploiting Activated Alkyne Chemistry for the Synthesis of Tailored Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Assemblies for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) synthesized via activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and self&#8208;assemble into fluorescent nanostructures, including dendrimersomes and micelles. These assemblies, with excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular uptake, demonstrate potential for live&#8208;cell imaging and nanomedicine applications. This work highlights an efficient approach for synthesizing AJDs for designing advanced nanomaterials with tunable optical properties.








Abstract
Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) are a promising class of macromolecules capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this study, AJDs were synthesized employing, for the first time, the activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry approach, enabling the construction of dendritic architectures under mild conditions. The AJDs were functionalized with a &#960;&#8208;extended tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative, imparting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. These AJDs self&#8208;assembled into fluorescent nanostructures, including micelles and dendrimersomes, with tunable dimensions. The AIE&#8208;active assemblies demonstrated strong photoluminescence upon formation and were characterized by narrow size distributions. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies using Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO&#8208;K1) cells revealed excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, confirming their potential for live&#8208;cell imaging. Importantly, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the TPE derivative facilitated excitation at longer wavelengths, compatible with conventional confocal microscopy. This work showcases the versatility of activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry in dendrimer synthesis and highlights the potential of these AJD&#8208;based nanostructures in nanomedicine, particularly for imaging and diagnostic applications.

     alt="Exploiting Activated Alkyne Chemistry for the Synthesis of Tailored Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers with Aggregation-Induced Emission and Their Assemblies for Cell Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) synthesized via activated alkyne-hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry exhibit aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties and self-assemble into fluorescent nanostructures, including dendrimersomes and micelles. These assemblies, with excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular uptake, demonstrate potential for live-cell imaging and nanomedicine applications. This work highlights an efficient approach for synthesizing AJDs for designing advanced nanomaterials with tunable optical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) are a promising class of macromolecules capable of self-assembling into well-defined nanostructures. In this study, AJDs were synthesized employing, for the first time, the activated alkyne-hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry approach, enabling the construction of dendritic architectures under mild conditions. The AJDs were functionalized with a &#960;-extended tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative, imparting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property. These AJDs self-assembled into fluorescent nanostructures, including micelles and dendrimersomes, with tunable dimensions. The AIE-active assemblies demonstrated strong photoluminescence upon formation and were characterized by narrow size distributions. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies using Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells revealed excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, confirming their potential for live-cell imaging. Importantly, the extended &#960;-conjugation of the TPE derivative facilitated excitation at longer wavelengths, compatible with conventional confocal microscopy. This work showcases the versatility of activated alkyne-hydroxyl &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry in dendrimer synthesis and highlights the potential of these AJD-based nanostructures in nanomedicine, particularly for imaging and diagnostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Sequestration of Palladium(II) Cations Using a Supramolecular Polymer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;based ligand is shown to selectively complex Pd(II) cations from an aqueous mixed&#8208;metal solution. Selectivity for Pd(II) is imparted in a copolymer when functionalized with the same ligand, demonstrating the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in metal recovery systems.








Abstract
The selective sequestration of aqueous palladium from waste is an attractive option for metal recovery. However, achieving good metal specificity remains a difficult problem. In this study, we present the synthesis of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular system based on a 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating ligand group. Excellent selectivity for Pd(II) ions over Pt(II), Ni(II), Fe(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) from a mixed&#8208;metal solution was demonstrated through ESI&#8208;MS and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies of a model ligand system. Following this, a water&#8208;soluble copolymer system containing 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole functional groups was prepared. This polymer was shown to exhibit the same specificity for Pd(II) in a mixed&#8208;metal solution, quantitatively supported by dialysis and ICP&#8208;MS experiments. These findings demonstrate the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in selective metal recovery.

         <title>A Reprocessable Dynamic Disulfide Hydrogel for Capacitive Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel of an amphiphilic polyethylene glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative. The elastic hydrogel demonstrates decent mechanical properties and reprocessing capability. A microstructured capacitive sensor incorporating the hydrogel exhibits a decent sensitivity up to 1.14&#160;kPa&#8722;1, a fast response time within 20&#160;ms, and a robust stability.








Abstract
With the rapidly growing demand for wearable sensor devices across a range of applications, sensing technology has been rapidly advancing. However, challenges such as limited sensitivity, device instability, and trade&#8208;offs between performance and recyclability remain unaddressed. We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel from an amphiphilic polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative with hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics. The hydrogel demonstrates decent thermal stability and adequate mechanical properties, including elasticity, compressibility, and reprocessing capability. It is also integrated into a microstructured capacitive sensor, demonstrating a sensitivity of up to 1.14&#160;kPa&#8722;1, rapid response times within 20&#160;ms, and robust functioning stability up to 400 consecutive cycles. These properties make it particularly intriguing for the sustainable development of high&#8208;performance wearable sensors.

A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed, substrate&#8208;controlled, site&#8208;selective one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported for the synthesis of biologically active 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives. The method involves the three&#8208;component coupling of benzoxazinones, amines, and diaryl/dialkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes yielding the corresponding products with high efficiency. It also enables the synthesis of various dihydroisoquinoline benzamide derivatives with chemo&#8208;selectivity.








Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted substrate&#8208;controlled, site&#8208;selective, one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component cascade dehydrogenative annulation reaction is reported here. The developed methodology leads to the synthesis of biologically active 4H&#8208;benzo[d] [1,3] oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives by the nucleophilic addition of amines to benzoxazinones followed by coupling with diphenyl acetylenes. In addition to providing excellent yields of products, the method is also regioselective. This new protocol has been demonstrated to have an easy access to a variety of dihydroisoquinoline benzamide derivatives.

         <title>Unlocking the Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Halogen Engineering in Carbazole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic incorporation of bromine into the carbazole dimer enables an efficient transition from thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in crystalline Cz&#8208;D to predominantly room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D, demonstrating a versatile strategy for modulating luminescent&#160;properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in metal&#8208;free organic materials offers immense potential for advanced optoelectronic applications. However, the rational design and fine&#8208;tuning of RTP remain challenging due to the complex correlation between molecular structure and photophysical processes. Herein, we explored the impact of intersystem crossing (ISC), spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), and halogen interactions to promote RTP in crystalline brominated carbazole dimer (BrCz&#8208;D). In contrast, the unsubstituted analogue, carbazole dimer (Cz&#8208;D) exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) under ambient conditions. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy measurements confirmed the population of triplet manifolds in both dimers. Bromine substitution significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling (VSOC&#160;=&#160;14.94 cm&#8315;&#185;), enabling efficient ISC and robust RTP in BrCz&#8208;D. Enhanced RTP in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D is attributed to unique halogen interactions, including Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, C&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, within the crystal lattice. Such halogen interactions are negligible in the solution state, accounting for the lack of RTP under ambient conditions. The present work highlights the critical role of SOC and halogen bonding in achieving efficient RTP for designing high&#8208;performance organic phosphorescent materials through crystallochemistry.

         <title>DOS&#8208;Like Strategy for the Spirocyclic MedChem Relevant Building Blocks via Petasis / Grubbs Reactions Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research has shown a strong potential for using a DOS&#8208;like approach on the building block level to generate novel perspective functionalized chemotypes. This potential was clearly demonstrated using a 2&#8208;step sequence, Petasis/Grubbs, to synthesize polyfunctional spiro compounds. In combination with standard parallel synthesis procedures from Enamine REAL, diverse 3D&#8208;shape blocks expand the chemical space to principally new directions.








Abstract
Through this model study, we showed broad perspectives on utilizing the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) like approach on the building block level in combination with well&#8208;developed methodologies for parallel synthesis for decoration and extension of ultra&#8208;large tangible chemical space to increase the speed and quality of drug discovery screening campaigns. This strategy led us to 16 novel Bemis&#8208;Murco scaffolds based on spirocyclic functionalized piperidines. The efficient, preparative, and scalable DOS&#8208;like approach to the above&#8208;mentioned motif was achieved by Petasis/Grubbs reactions sequence on a multigram scale. The chemoinformatically generated amide&#8208;based compound libraries demonstrated significant expansion of the chemical space of tangible compounds (on the example of Enamine's REAL database).

         <title>Toward Symmetric Organic Aqueous Flow Batteries: Triarylamine&#8208;Based Bipolar Molecules and Their Characterization via an Extended Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules based on a triarylamine skeleton and a viologen unit for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries are presented. Cyclic voltammetry shows that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety can be reversibly reduced. A modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis is presented to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region.








Abstract
Symmetric organic flow batteries (SOFBs) can potentially address membrane crossover problems by employing bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules (BROMs). Herein, a triarylamine (TAA) skeleton was chosen as a posolyte moiety for a new class of bipolar molecules for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous flow batteries (FBs). Pyridinium and viologen derivatives were tethered to the posolyte moiety, and the new compounds were characterized. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety via a Zincke reaction, could be reversibly reduced. Varying the supporting electrolyte concentration on the selected derivative revealed water solubility as a challenge for further development. The selected derivative, MeO&#8208;TPA&#8208;Vi&#8208;DMAE, was subjected to hydrodynamic voltammetry, and a modified Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich analysis was developed to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region, which are often seen with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. This model discarded a purely Ohmic effect, showing a useful Levich slope at a certain overpotential before the onset of a secondary reaction. TAA&#8208;based BROMs hold promise for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous SOFBs, and the results will guide the design of new derivatives. The three&#8208;term Kouteck&#253;&#8211;Levich relation here introduced will be useful not only to develop BROM&#8208;based FBs but will most likely appeal to a much broader audience.

         <title>Bionanocomposite of Dual Antioxidant and Protease Function by Co&#8208;Immobilization of Tannic Acid and Papain on Anionic Clays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of highly stable bionanocomposite dispersions of antioxidant and protease activities was achieved by co&#8208;immobilization of TA and papain on LDH nanoparticles.








Abstract
The synchronized operation of antioxidants and enzymes is necessary for the proper functioning of living organisms and various industrial processes. The drawback that these biomolecules are susceptible to several environmental factors can be overcome by their immobilization on appropriate host materials. Here, molecular antioxidant tannic acid (TA) and papain enzyme (PPN) were co&#8208;immobilized on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles to enhance their stability and facilitate their combined function. In the sequential adsorption method governed by electrostatic interactions, TA was first adsorbed on oppositely charged LDH (LDH/TA) and then, PPN was immobilized on the surface of the nanoparticles (LDH/TA/PPN). The optimal TA and PPN doses were determined by systematic size and charge measurements of the particles in dispersions to obtain stable colloids in each preparation step. The co&#8208;immobilization of the biomolecules was confirmed by spectroscopy methods. The resulting LDH/TA/PPN nanocomposite exhibited remarkable antioxidant and protease activities. The dual biological function together with the considerable colloidal stability make the LDH/TA/PPN material a promising candidate in various processes in academia and more applied disciplines, where simultaneous antioxidant and proteolytic functions are desired.

         <title>Nitro&#8208;Group &#960; System Drives the Interaction of RRx&#8208;001 with Electrons in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of cluster experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy with theory enables tracking of the chemistry induced by secondary low&#8208;energy electrons to RRx&#8208;001 in solution from the initial interaction to the final radiolysis products. The catalytic and state&#8208;selective nature of the LEE interaction is identified, with consequences for the understanding of the LEE action in radiation damage in&#160;general.








Abstract
Reactivity toward low&#8208;energy electrons (LEE) has been hypothesized as a cause of radio&#8208;modifying properties for various molecules. LEE's transient nature, however, prevents the establishment of clear links between initial processes at the sub&#8208;ps time scale and the final products of radiolysis. Here, such links are explored for the radio&#8208;modifying compound RRx&#8208;001 (1&#8208;bromoacetyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidine).
Picosecond pulse radiolysis demonstrates the high scavenging capacity of the molecule for secondary quasi&#8208;free and solvated electrons forming stable parent anions confirmed by studies of microsolvated RRx&#8208;001 in clusters. The anions decay either via auto&#8208;detachment of an electron or dissociate involving hydrogen transfer from solvent, resulting in NO2 and 1&#8208;(bromoacetyl)&#8208;3&#8208;nitroazetidine. Surprisingly, no Br dissociation is observed despite its high electron affinity. We assign this behavior to the &#8220;inaccessibility&#8221; of sigma virtual states for electrons in the solvent, which can be of a general nature.

Abstract
The direct &#945;&#8208;arylation of a protected 4&#8208;hydroxy piperidine via a one&#8208;pot Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction is described. The methodology uses a single solvent, toluene, for the lithiation/transmetallation/Negishi sequence and 20 examples are presented. Of note, the high&#8208;yielding cross&#8208;coupling of a range of pharmaceutically relevant heteroaryl bromides is reported. The reactions show high levels of 2,4&#8208;cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and further functionalizations are also described. Piperidine is the most common nitrogen heterocycle in approved drugs and our approach delivers such heterocycles via a direct diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of 4&#8208;substituted N&#8208;Boc piperidines; as such, the approach is ready to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct &#945;-arylation of a protected 4-hydroxy piperidine via a one-pot Negishi cross-coupling reaction is described. The methodology uses a single solvent, toluene, for the lithiation/transmetallation/Negishi sequence and 20 examples are presented. Of note, the high-yielding cross-coupling of a range of pharmaceutically relevant heteroaryl bromides is reported. The reactions show high levels of 2,4-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diastereoselectivity and further functionalizations are also described. Piperidine is the most common nitrogen heterocycle in approved drugs and our approach delivers such heterocycles via a direct diastereoselective &#945;-functionalization of 4-substituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc piperidines; as such, the approach is ready to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Copper(I) Catenane Decorated Metal&#8211;Organic Layer as a Heterogenous Catalyst for Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported in this work is a metal&#8208;organic layer decorated with a 2D array of catalytically active Cu(I) catenanes for dehydrogenative C&#9472;O coupling. Kinetic stabilization effects from the interlocked ligands not only preserve the structural integrity of the molecular Cu(I) catalyst for a straightforward attachment onto the solid support, but also maintain the metal in a well&#8208;defined coordination sphere and prevent its undesired oxidation to Cu(II) to give a side product from C&#9472;C coupling.








Abstract
While earth&#8208;abundant metals are green and sustainable alternatives to precious metals for catalytic chemical conversions, the fast ligand exchange involving most of the base metals renders their development into robust, reusable catalysts very challenging. Described in this work is a new type of heterogeneous catalyst derived from a 2D metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) grafted with catenane&#8208;coordinated Cu(I) complexes. In addition to the good substrate accessibility, easy functionalization, and other favorable features due to the MOL support, the mechanical bond in the anchored catenane ligands also represents a new mechanism to dynamically confine the coordination environment and kinetically stabilize the coordinated Cu(I) to give a well&#8208;defined, active yet stable heterogeneous catalyst. Pilot catalytic studies using a model dehydrogenative C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling reaction showed that the Cu(I) catenane&#8208;grafted MOL led to exclusive formation of the C&#9472;O coupled product, whereas control catalysis using a similar Cu(I) catalyst supported by non&#8208;interlocked macrocyclic ligands was found to also give a C&#9472;C coupled by&#8208;product, whose formation was found to be mediated by the uncontrolled oxidation of the Cu(I) to Cu(II), highlighting the distinctive roles and untapped potential of the catenane coordination in developing base metal&#8208;derived catalysts for challenging catalytic conditions.

Herein, an &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of C&#8208;glycoside with 1&#8208;bromosugars and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones is reported, leveraging visible light&#8208;mediated excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. This process involves the generation of glycosyl radicals from easily accessible 1&#8208;bromosugar precursors, which can capture quinoxalinone under photoinduced Pd(0) catalysis. The reaction operates under mild conditions, offering excellent axial selectivity with a diverse array of substrates.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Molecular Bowls Comprising Adjacent Pentagons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended nitrogen&#8208;centered molecular bowls containing adjacent pentagonal rings are synthesized and characterized. While the peripherally fused benzene rings contribute minimally to the bowl curvature, the functional groups in the molecular bowls exert a pronounced influence on the host&#8208;guest binding constants observed in solution&#8208;phase interactions with fullerene.








Abstract
While the classical buckybowls, such as corannulene, and sumanene, have been extensively investigated, research on other molecular bowls containing double neighboring pentagonal rings remains underdeveloped. Here we present the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped molecular bowls incorporating adjacent pentagonal motifs with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface. Their molecular curvatures are preserved according to the analyses of bowl&#8208;depth, &#960;&#8208;orbital axis vector angles, and inversion energy barrier when compared to those of their parent structures. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation induces the bathochromic shifts of both absorption and emission spectra, the narrowed energy gaps of the frontier molecular orbitals, as well as the enhanced aromatic character in the fused pentagonal rings. Furthermore, the extended aromatic surface enables the binding with fullerene C60 in solution.

         <title>CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx Composite Interfaces with Strong Lewis Acid Activity for Electrooxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZrO2&#8208;TiOx was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanowires with H2C2O4 and Zr(NO3)4. Subsequently, CuOx was uniformly disposed on ZrO2&#8208;TiOx with the assistance of PVP and citric acid. The prepared catalyst with rich interfaces exhibits strong Lewis acid activity and high CH4 adsorption capacity. And the optimized electrode achieves the FE of 60.1% for CH3COOH at the current density of 10.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a production rate of 3312.5&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;hour&#8722;1.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of methane (CH4) to valuable oxygenates is an attractive approach to utilize abundant natural gas, however, the chemical inertness of CH4 and its low solubility in electrolytes impede effective electrooxidation. Enhancing the adsorption and activation of CH4 on catalysts is crucial for electrocatalytic methane oxidation reaction (eMOR). In this study, we developed the CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx composite catalyst for the selective electrooxidation of CH4 to CH3COOH. The ZrO2&#8208;TiOx was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanowires with H2C2O4 and Zr(NO3)4. Subsequently, CuOx was uniformly disposed on ZrO2&#8208;TiOx with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citric acid. The prepared electrode achieves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.1% for CH3COOH at the current density of 10.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, corresponding to the generation rate of 3312.5&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. Mechanism studies confirm that the synergistic effect of CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces enhances the efficiency of eMOR. CuOx oxidizes H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces with strong Lewis acid activity adsorb and activate CH4. The CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces synergistically oxidize CH4 to generate a series of intermediates (*CH3, *CH3O, *CH2O, *COOH), promoting C&#8208;C coupling to produce CH3COOH.

The ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Zr(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequently, CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; was uniformly disposed on ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citric acid. The prepared electrode achieves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.1% for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH at the current density of 10.8&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to the generation rate of 3312.5&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Mechanism studies confirm that the synergistic effect of CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces enhances the efficiency of eMOR. CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; oxidizes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces with strong Lewis acid activity adsorb and activate CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces synergistically oxidize CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to generate a series of intermediates (*CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O, *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, *COOH), promoting C-C coupling to produce CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of a Homochiral Porous Organic Cage RCC2&#8208;S&#8208;Bonded Silica as a Stationary Phase for High&#8208;Performance Liquid Chromatography Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral stationary phase (CSP), RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH, was prepared by bonding a homochiral porous organic cage onto thiolated silica (SiO2&#8208;SH) by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The CSP shows excellent chiral separation capability not only in normal&#8208;phase HPLC (NP&#8208;HPLC) but also in reversed&#8208;phase HPLC (RP&#8208;HPLC), as shown by the enantioseparation of various racemates.








Abstract
In this work, a reduced homochiral porous organic cage (RCC2&#8208;S)&#8208;based chiral stationary phase (CSP), RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH, was prepared by bonding RCC2&#8208;S on thiolated silica (SiO2&#8208;SH) via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The CSP (RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH) showed excellent enantioseparation in both normal&#8208;phase HPLC (NP&#8208;HPLC) and reversed&#8208;phase HPLC (RP&#8208;HPLC) modes, effectively separating various chiral compounds, including alcohols, esters, ketones, amines, imidazoles, epoxides, and organic acids. As a result, 12 racemates were enantioseparated under NP&#8208;HPLC, and 17 racemates were enantioseparated under RP&#8208;HPLC. The CSP also exhibited good complementarity in chiral separation with commercial Chiralpak AD&#8208;H, Chiralcel OD&#8208;H, and the previously reported chiral POC CC19&#8208;R columns, successfully separating some racemates that remained unresolved or poorly resolved on these three columns. Additionally, the fabricated RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH packed column demonstrated good reproducibility and stability. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of retention time and resolution value were less than 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, after the column had been subjected to hundreds of injections. This work indicates that chiral porous organic cages have great potential for the separation of enantiomers in HPLC.

A Copper&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H olefination of pivanilides with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl iodonium salts was achieved using a weakly coordinated directing group (DG). The involvement of a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state was plausibly critical in ensuring the challenging meta selectivity.








Abstract
Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;olefination of anilides using alkenyl iodonium salts. The olefination of a panel of pivanilides was achieved using an additive&#8208;free copper&#8208;based catalytic system under mild reaction conditions (25 examples, up to 60% yield). By favoring a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state, the approach demonstrated an excellent regioselectivity for the meta C&#9472;H functionalization with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl groups using a weakly coordinated directing group (DG). Postfunctionalization reactions were conducted, highlighting both the synthetic interest of the products and the potential atom&#8208;efficiency of the process.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanochannels: Suprasome&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Ionophore to Regulate Transmembrane Zn2+&#160;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivatives that generate nanochannels within the lipid bilayers for the selective transmembrane transport of Zn2&#8314; ions. These transporters were delivered to bacterial cells using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based suprasome assemblies, activated by Zn2&#8314;&#8208;induced disassembly. The disruption in ionic homeostasis generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the death of Gram&#8208;positive Gram&#8208;negative and drug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
The development of synthetic ion channels and stimuli&#8208;responsive suprasomes represents two crucial yet largely disconnected areas of supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we demonstrated that suprasomes can effectively deliver hydrophobic synthetic ion transporters to lipid membranes, regulating physiologically significant transition metal ions and subsequently modulating activity within lipid&#8208;bound compartments. We showed that a potent bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivative self&#8208;assembles within the lipid bilayer to form a supramolecular nanochannel, which facilitates selective and efficient transport of Zn2+ ions from the external aqueous solution across the lipid bilayer and into the internal solution of large unilamellar vesicles via an electrogenic pathway. The hydrophobic ion transporter could also be delivered to lipid bilayers due to its inherent ability to form suprasomal assembly with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) through dynamic host&#8211;guest interactions. The Zn2&#8314; ions serve as stimuli to disassemble the suprasomes and release the ion transporter, which further penetrates the bilayers of lipid vesicles and regulates transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport. The application of this strategy of stimuli&#8208;mediated delivery of synthetic ion transporters to regulate transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport showed antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive, Gram&#8208;negative, and drug&#8208;resistant bacterial cells.

         <title>Polyimides with Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Properties by End&#8208;capping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimides HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI demonstrate simultaneous excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) when end&#8208;capped with ESIPT fluorophores. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that their keto forms facilitate more efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) channels, exhibiting significantly larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) constants compared to the enol form, thereby enhancing their RTP performance.








Abstract
Organic polymers possessing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) significantly impact their electronic and optical properties through stimulus response, leading to unique photoluminescence behaviors such as large Stokes shifts, dual emission, and environmental sensitivity. In this work, polyimides (PIs) exhibiting both ESIPT and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties were designed and synthesized by end&#8208;capping with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBTA) and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzimidazole (HBIA), respectively. HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI exhibit bright yellow&#8208;green and sky&#8208;blue fluorescence at 510&#160;nm and 470&#160;nm, with a relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields of about 27.2% and 25.1%, respectively. Importantly, HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI show excellent RTP emissions at 520&#160;nm and 485&#160;nm, with decay lifetimes of 76.5&#160;ms and 53.2&#160;ms.

     alt="Polyimides with Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Room-Temperature Phosphorescence Properties by End-capping"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyimides HBTA-PI and HBIA-PI demonstrate simultaneous excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) when end-capped with ESIPT fluorophores. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that their keto forms facilitate more efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) channels, exhibiting significantly larger spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constants compared to the enol form, thereby enhancing their RTP performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic polymers possessing excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) significantly impact their electronic and optical properties through stimulus response, leading to unique photoluminescence behaviors such as large Stokes shifts, dual emission, and environmental sensitivity. In this work, polyimides (PIs) exhibiting both ESIPT and room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties were designed and synthesized by end-capping with 5-amino-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBTA) and 5-amino-2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzimidazole (HBIA), respectively. HBTA-PI and HBIA-PI exhibit bright yellow-green and sky-blue fluorescence at 510&#160;nm and 470&#160;nm, with a relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields of about 27.2% and 25.1%, respectively. Importantly, HBTA-PI and HBIA-PI show excellent RTP emissions at 520&#160;nm and 485&#160;nm, with decay lifetimes of 76.5&#160;ms and 53.2&#160;ms. The theoretical results indicate that the effective and large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constants from their keto forms in the excited state can enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) process to produce triplet excitons. The rigid polyimide networks further inhibit the nonradiative decay of triplet excitons and enhance phosphorescence emission. Additionally, the excellent ESIPT properties of HBTA-PI and HBIA-PI enable the detection of HCl vapor, which induces multiple fluorescent and phosphorescent color changes. This work provides good examples of polyimides for organic polymers with ESIPT properties and multi-stimulus response emissions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bis(10&#8208;oxacorrole) with Fused Pyridine as a Linker: Synthesis, Structure, and Interaction between the Subunits in the Neutral, Mono&#8208;, and Dicationic States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of aromatic pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole) nickel(II) complexes was obtained starting from antiaromatic norcorrolatonickel(II). Interaction between the subunits of the dimer allowed observation of four&#8208;step oxidation, giving rise to strong absorptions in the NIR region.








Abstract
Pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole)s are obtained by a Hantzsch&#8208;type cyclization using arylaldehydes and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;oxacorrole. Spectroscopic characteristics, corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicate aromaticity of the dimer and strong interaction between the subunits. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical analyses indicate facile access to cation radicals and dicationic species. The oxidized forms are characterized by electronic and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopies as well as by DFT calculations. Monocations give rise to strong absorption bands in the near infra&#8208;red (NIR) region between 1500 and 2500&#160;nm, while dications are characterized by a series of absorptions between 1000 and 2200&#160;nm. ESR and variable temperature (VT) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments indicate the presence of singlet&#8208;triplet spin equilibria for the solution of the dication. For the dication of bis(oxacorrole) in the singlet ground state, neither aromaticity nor antiaromaticity has been detected by low&#8208;temperature 1H NMR and gauge independent atomic orbital (GIAO) calculations despite delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons.

         <title>The Effect of Aldehyde and Carboxylic Acid Substitution on the Isomerization of Hemithioindigo Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core of an HTI photoswitch with different oxidation states of the sulfur heteroatom was modified by introducing aldehydes and carboxylic acid substituents for tailored absorption, quantum yields, and thermal stability. Notably, the substituted HTIs enabled high isomerization yields, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduces photochromism. Solid&#8208;state photoisomerization was demonstrated on an HTI that was incorporated into a MOF.








Abstract
Hemithioindigo (HTI) photoswitches exhibit robust photoisomerization under visible light and relatively high thermal bistability. In this work, we report various modifications of the HTI core, namely the introduction of aldehydes and carboxylic acids at the para position of the stilbene fragment with different oxidation states of the sulfur center, and the incorporation of a Schiff base moiety. These modifications allowed tuning of the absorption properties, quantum yields of isomerization, and thermal stability of the metastable E&#8208;isomers. Notably, the formyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;substituted HTI switches achieved high yields of isomerization under visible light in various solvents, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduced photochromism. Schiff base formation led to red&#8208;shifted absorption and increased thermal stability. Finally, by leveraging the carboxyl substituents, we incorporated an HTI chromophore into the NU&#8208;1000 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and demonstrated solid&#8208;state photoisomerization. These findings highlight key structural modifications that expand the applicability of HTI photoswitches for molecular switching in solution and solid&#8208;state environments.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Mononucleotide Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;responsive mononucleotide coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions via azobenzene photoisomerization. Coacervates with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV light, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling nucleotide release. This minimal system highlights the potential role of light for exploring energy&#8208;driven phase separation in de novo protocells.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the formation of biomolecular condensates in modern cells and is also explored as a mechanism for assembling protocells. Phase&#8208;separated droplets provide dynamic micro&#8208;environments that concentrate reactants, enhance reactions, and allow molecular exchange, essential for both cellular regulation, and adaptive compartmentalization. While modern cells achieve dynamic LLPS through enzymatic and metabolic pathways, protocells may be designed to harness external stimuli such as pH, temperature, redox potential, or light. However, existing studies of light&#8208;responsive coacervates rely on complex biomolecules, limiting their use as minimal platforms of energy&#8208;driven phase separation. Here, we develop a minimal system of light&#8208;responsive coacervates composed of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight species: mononucleotides and azobenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles with varying charge valency. These coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions through azobenzene photoisomerization, with their behavior governed by charge valency and nucleotide structure. We demonstrate that coacervates formed with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV irradiation but exhibit significant property changes, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling light&#8208;controlled nucleotide release. Additionally, we achieved hierarchical droplet organization and light&#8208;actuated biomolecular localization within multiphase systems. Overall, these findings establish a minimal platform for designing light&#8208;responsive synthetic protocells, providing insights into dynamic compartmentalization in de novo life&#8208;like systems.

         <title>Core&#8208;Twisted, Cationic Perylene Diimides; Homochiral Dimerization and Chiroptical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The installation of two 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium heterocycles on the aromatic core of a perylene diimide (PDI) generates a twisted and cationic organic dye. As potent hydrogen bond donors, these groups enable the PDI to self&#8208;assemble into discrete and robust homochiral dimers in solution. Furthermore, the enantioselective recognition of chiral anions is exploited for chiroptical sensing.








Abstract
Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are chiral organic dyes that may be exploited for self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials or for the enantioselective recognition and sensing of chiral substrates. Discrete self&#8208;assembled dimers and host&#8211;guest complexes of core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides are important for furthering our understanding of this supramolecular chemistry, yet they are rare because the twisted perylene core significantly weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with the PDI's &#960;&#8208;surface. To address this challenge, we have installed hydrogen bond donor groups in the PDI's bay positions, which direct the formation of a robust, co&#8208;facial and homochiral intermolecular PDI dimer. The structure of this discrete dimer is distinct from previous aggregates of non&#8208;planar PDIs that utilize the imide position for hydrogen bonding. We also uncover the potential of core&#8208;twisted, dicationic PDIs for the enantioselective recognition and chiroptical sensing of chiral anions and investigate the basis of this response via chiral complementarity in the discrete host&#8211;guest complex.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Prodrug Linkers That Simultaneously Release Cargo and Neutralize In Situ Generated (Aza)Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reactive (aza)quinone methides are electrophiles generated from many stimuli&#8208;responsive prodrugs and probes. A new linker has been designed to quench the electrophilic methide, forming a tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) heterocycle in high yields, even when a competing nucleophile is present. Upon neutralizing the electrophile, the THIQ itself is relatively nontoxic, boding well for future prodrug linker strategies






.

Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative linkers that use p&#8208;amino/hydroxy&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl (PABC/PHBC) spacers are essential to the mechanism of many prodrugs. However, a highly reactive (aza)quinone methide is generated as a potential toxic byproduct. To remove the methide as it forms, we synthesized a series of novel tripartite prodrugs, comprising different triggers (nitro, amide, azide, boronate) and a PABC/PHBC&#8208;type self&#8208;immolative spacer with an integrated nucleophile (amine). Upon reductive, hydrolytic, or oxidative&#8208;trigger activation, the release of the cargo is facilitated via a 1,6&#8208;elimination that generates a reactive (aza)quinone methide. With the built&#8208;in nucleophile, the (aza)quinone methide is rapidly self&#8208;quenched to generate tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). One of the selected THIQs does not exhibit an anti&#8208;proliferative effect on the A431 mammalian tumor cell line. The new prodrug strategy has broad scope, enabling the use of a trigger that matches the targeted stimulus, while allowing for a diverse range of drug/cargo attachment. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study adds a new linker strategy that quenches the electrophilic (aza)quinone methide generated in many self&#8208;immolative linker systems and could find applications in prodrug and antibody&#8208;drug conjugate strategies, or as a linker for probes in chemical biology.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Lactam Ylidenes: An Overlooked Class of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular synthetic approach toward four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is presented. BLCs feature moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity which includes the formation of olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers, oxirane formation with acetone, and fragmentation to ketenimines. Experimental findings are rationalized by DFT calculations.








Abstract
In this study, the underappreciated class of &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is revisited and systematically explored. The required precursors are available in a highly modular synthetic approach from simple starting materials. Two routes may be followed for the generation of the free BLCs: thermal fragmentation of spiro&#8208;fused oxadiazoles (110&#160;&#176;C, toluene), or deprotonation of carbene HCl&#8208;adducts at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C with a strong base. TEP values (2065&#8211;2072&#160;cm&#8722;1), 77Se NMR shifts of selenium&#8208;adducts (812&#8211;995&#160;ppm), as well as DFT calculations reveal moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of BLCs, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity. The formation of a wide variety of products under thermal conditions in the cause of oxadiazole fragmentation (110&#160;&#176;C, toluene) is rationalized by a combination of computational reaction discovery and experimental validation. Products include olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers arising from bimolecular reactions, while sterically more demanding precursors are converted in a monomolecular fragmentation reaction via CO release to form ketenimines as intermediates, which finally form amides. With substituents providing appropriate steric protection, a persistent BLC is available via the low temperature route, characterized by its 13C NMR shift of 287&#160;ppm at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Synthesis of C4&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Cross&#8208;Ketonization: The Importance of Precise Temperature Control in Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 31, June 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of reversed C&#8208;glycosides from carboxylic acid building blocks is enabled by metallaphotoredox cross&#8208;ketonization. Precise temperature control is essential for matching the rates of the photoredox and Ni catalytic processes, an understudied factor in photoredox chemistry that could be critical in the study of other dual&#8208;catalytic photoredox systems.








Abstract
We describe herein a method for the synthesis of reversed C&#8208;acyl glycosides by direct cross&#8208;ketonization of linear carboxylic acids with carboxy sugars under metallaphotoredox conditions. This reaction proves to be highly sensitive to reaction temperature, with the reproducibility and yield of ketonization highly dependent upon precise temperature control. Analysis of the reaction mechanism suggests this sensitivity reflects the need to match the rate of Ni catalytic turnover with the rate of photocatalytic decarboxylation of the carboxy sugar. The insights gained from this study have important implications for the study of all metallaphotoredox reactions as well as other photoreactions that involve dual catalytic cycles.

A radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes using Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst has been used to access 1&#8208;Indanone derivatives. There are some advantages to the reaction such as available materials, simple operation, and compatibility with a wide range of substituents. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b] naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst.








Abstract
1&#8208;Indanone derivatives are efficiently synthesized via a radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes, using TBHP as both oxidant and reactant, in the presence of Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid as the cocatalyst. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b]naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst. This transformation offers key advantages, including operational simplicity, cost&#8208;effective and readily available materials, scalability to gram quantities, and compatibility with a wide range of functional groups. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirmed that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, highlighting the pivotal role of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst in altering product selectivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting a linear disulfide&#8208;bridged polymer to a supporting polymer backbone achieved heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis. The polyvinyl backbone ensures recyclability while enabling thiyl radical generation for organic transformations. Achieving &#8764;99% conversion for diarylalkyne photooxidation, the design strategy combines robustness, solubility, and reusability, advancing thiyl radical catalysis for sustainable applications.








Abstract
Dynamic disulfide bonds offer a promising avenue for developing robust and reversible photocatalysts. This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly&#8208;SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly&#8208;SS features linear disulfide&#8208;containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly&#8208;SS demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2&#8208;diketones, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly&#8208;SS, enabling facile thin&#8208;film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide&#8208;linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.

         <title>Unleashing the Biosensing Potential of 2D Inorganic Nanomaterials: the Journey of a Decade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D inorganic nanomaterials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), MXenes, black phosphorus (BP) and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), have transformed biosensing. Their superior conductivity, extensive surface area and biocompatibility facilitates disease detection and diagnosis. This review underscores recent advancements, focusing on their physicochemical characteristics and biosensing potential in healthcare.








Abstract
With the growing need for rapid, sensitive and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensors, 2D nanomaterials have gained significant attention, establishing them as versatile candidates for advanced biomedical applications. Biosensors utilizing 2D nanomaterials enable real&#8208;time disease monitoring, allowing for prompt intervention and therapy, tracking of physiological activities and enhancing the understanding of the human biosystem. Since they are cost&#8208;effective and user&#8208;friendly, 2D nanomaterials have been utilized in commercial biosensors. Over the past decade, graphene and its derivatives have been the most studied 2D nanomaterials, due to their large surface area and tuneable electronic and optical properties, which significantly enhance their sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, recently discovered 2D nanomaterials, including MXenes, black phosphorus and hexagonal boron nitride, remain largely unexplored. Despite their numerous applications, the broader potential of these materials in biosensing remains insufficiently explored in current literature. This review offers a comprehensive perspective by specifically focusing on inorganic 2D nanomaterials, an area that remains underrepresented in the literature. It provides an in&#8208;depth overview of their unique physicochemical properties and how these features contribute toward enhancing the performance of biosensors, thereby offering new and valuable insights into their emerging role in advanced biomedical diagnostics.

         <title>Dinuclear Copper Complex with a Pyridazine&#8208;Bridged Octadentate Ligand: Monooxygenase Activity and Characterization of Copper&#8208;Oxygen Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to various copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates: Depending on the reaction conditions, different copper&#8208;oxygen intermediates can be obtained with our new dinuclear complex. Whereas low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1 hydroperoxo complex, oxygenation at room temperature generates a &#8220;green species&#8221; that looks like a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo complex but rather corresponds to a dihydroxo complex. The reactivities of all of these intermediates as well as the &#956;&#8208;hydroxo complex toward hydrocarbons are investigated.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the mono&#8208;oxygenation of aromatic and aliphatic substrates in nature. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a new dinuclear copper complex supported by an octadentate ligand with a pyridazine backbone. Low&#8208;temperature oxygenation leads to a &#956;&#8208;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OOH) complex, which in turn stoichiometrically converts anthrone (AT) to anthraquinone (AQ). Oxygenation at room temperature, by contrast, leads to a new species that mediates the conversion of AT to AQ in a catalytic fashion, but neither corresponds to a &#956;&#8208;peroxo nor a mono &#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper complex. For further analysis, a &#956;&#8208;hydroxo dicopper(II) (Cu2OH) complex is synthesized by oxidation of the copper(I) complex with AgOTf. The electronic and geometric structures of the Cu2OOH and Cu2OH intermediates, as well as the structure of the room&#8208;temperature oxygenation product are elucidated by UV/Vis, Raman, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and mass spectrometry, coupled to DFT.

         <title>Ligand Mediated Metal&#8208;Metal and Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity in Cesium Coordination Polymers and its Beneficial Role in the ROP of Cyclic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, an infinite ladder chain, and a well&#8208;connected 3D cage were developed by tuning the substituent on iminopyrrolyl architecture. The 2D sheet of cesium polymer was efficiently fragmented into a monomeric complex by employing 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6. Subsequently, cesium complexes were found to be competent catalysts in the ROP of rac&#8208;lactide and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone.








Abstract
Designing a multimetallic catalyst based on the principle of metalloenzymes has emerged as a promising route to enhance catalytic performance owing to the combined action of different metal centers in a cooperative fashion. The cooperativity of metal centers with the surrounding ligand environment in metalloenzymes plays a crucial role in driving efficient catalysis. However, the replication of such cooperativity in a synthetic system is very challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of diverse cesium coordination polymeric networks, a 2D sheet, [Cs{&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3))}]&#8734; (1), an infinite ladder chain, [Cs{&#954;3&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(CHPh2))}]&#8734; (2), and a 3D cage [Cs2{&#954;3&#8208;(C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;NCH2CH2N(CH2CH2)2O))}]&#8734; (3). This was accomplished by a variation of the substituent on the iminopyrrolyl ligand. Moreover, we studied a breakdown of the 2D sheet coordination polymer (1) into contact pair monomeric cesium complex [(18&#8208;Cr&#8208;6)Cs(&#954;2&#8208;C4H3N&#8208;2(CH&#160;=&#160;N(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)))] (4). In the coordination polymers, multiple Cs centers are held together within a proximal distance (3.5&#8211;6&#160;&#197;) via an iminopyrrolyl ligand. The Cs coordination polymer 2 displays the highest catalytic efficiency in ring opening polymerization of rac&#8208;lactide (ROP), giving a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 49.5 h&#8722;1 compared to 15.7 h&#8722;1 and 24.0 h&#8722;1 for 1 and 3. The higher reactivity of 2 in comparison to 1 and 3 is due to the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity in cesium coordination polymeric networks.

         <title>A Very Readily Prepared Ligand for Rhodium Catalyzed Propene Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments aimed at switching the selectivity of rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation from a linear&#8208;selective to a branched selective reaction feature ligands that are relatively complicated to prepare. A new ligand, EasyDiPhos, can be made in just one synthetic step and gives unusually low n:iso ratios, i.e., favoring the branched aldehyde, iso&#8208;butanal, in propene hydroformylation.








Abstract
In the search for an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make ligand that would enable Rh catalyzed hydroformylation of propene to favor the branched aldehydes, iso&#8208;butanal, bis&#8208;phosphonites and bis&#8208;phosphoramidites were designed. Catalysts derived from bis&#8208;phosphonites gave the desired low n:iso ratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis. A bis&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low n:iso ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of high pressure infra&#8208;red (HPIR) spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with n:iso ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000&#160;mol/mol in 1 hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most iso&#8208;selective example, had a partially flexible n:iso ratio depending on temperature and pressure. Two Pt(II) complexes were prepared and their X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined. The most&#160;iso&#8208;selective catalyst was examined at low temperature (prioritizing iso&#8208;selectivity over rates) in hydroformylation of some other terminal alkenes with significant branched selectivity.

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, POMs are introduced into the PECCP system. The carboxyltin functionalized Bi&#8208;POMs can tightly composite with TiO2, and the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes can provide PECCP for 304 stainless steel in seawater, which is expected to be a promising photoanode for in real seawater.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP) is a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, and constructing photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark is a key challenge. Herein, four cases of transition metal (TM) and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO2, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM&#8208;based materials useable in the PECCP field for the first time. Under illumination, the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8211;465&#160;mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175&#160;mV were significantly lower than that of TiO2 (&#8722;97&#160;mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO2 ensures Bi&#8208;POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stable and sustainable cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up construction of leaf&#8208;like materials capable of using visible light and water to produce oxygen and chemical energy&#160;is a major goal of artificial photosynthesis. In this work, we show that robust artificial cells (protocells) prepared by&#160;the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervate droplets with a&#160;bio&#8208;inspired Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalate catalytic oxygen evolving center&#160;are capable of continuous&#160;light&#8208;assisted water&#160;oxidation at room temperature. We then&#160;present&#160;a method to electrostatically assemble millions of the&#160;photocatalytic protocells into tissue&#8208;like protocellular sheets and spheroids, and demonstrate that the protocellular assemblies exhibit enhanced rates of photocatalytic water oxidation compared with individual protocells. Our results highlight opportunities for synergistically integrating key aspects of photocatalysis, cytomimetics and bottom&#8208;up engineering towards the development of modular photosynthetic active matter and applications in artificial photosynthesis and energy capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Chemistry based Simulation of Enantioseparation on Cyclodextrin&#8208; and Polysaccharide&#8208;based Chiral Stationary Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the capability of modern quantum chemical methods to simulate enantioseparation on chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by comparing calculated and experimental elution orders (EEOs). Compared to previous studies, this work utilizes more accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) methods combined with automated computational workflows. The proposed approach employs molecular docking, conformer sampling, and DFT refinement for final ensemble&#8208;based association free energy calculations of two diastereomeric complexes. Ten drug&#8208;type molecules were considered on two common CSPs for which various molecular models were investigated. While the association free energies of the strongest binding motifs were rather system&#8208;depended ranging from about &#8722;9 kcal/mol to 29 kcal/mol, the differences between the two enantiomers were always only a few kcal/mol, sometimes even below 1 kcal/mol. Despite these small differences, correct determination of EEOs for all tested cyclodextrin&#8208;based CSP systems was achieved. Even for more flexible polysaccharide&#8208;based CSPs, the workflow yielded correct EEO results in 90% of the tested cases provided that a sufficiently large cut&#8208;out of the CSP material consisting of about 150 atoms was considered as model. Due to the latter constraint, the method remains computationally expensive, requiring further research for improving practical application in, e.g., screening studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photoredox/Palladium Catalysis Enabled Enantioselective Heck/Reductive Allylic Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective reductive coupling reaction of conjugated dienes was developed. This transformation provides a platform for synthesizing optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters.








Abstract
The merger of palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions with photochemical radical chemistry represents a cutting&#8208;edge field in transition metal catalysis. We report a photochemical palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Heck/reductive allylic homocoupling reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes. The transformation has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform to synthesize optically pure chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes bearing 1,8&#8208;stereocenters. The reaction initiates with a Heck&#8208;type addition to generate a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;PdII species, followed by a photoredox process or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) to generate an allylic radical, which undergoes homocoupling to give the final product.

&lt;p&gt;A photochemical palladium-catalyzed regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective reductive coupling reaction of conjugated dienes was developed. This transformation provides a platform for synthesizing optically pure chiral 1,5-dienes bearing 1,8-stereocenters.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger of palladium-catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions with photochemical radical chemistry represents a cutting-edge field in transition metal catalysis. We report a photochemical palladium-catalyzed enantioselective Heck/reductive allylic homocoupling reaction of 1,3-dienes. The transformation has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, providing a platform to synthesize optically pure chiral 1,5-dienes bearing 1,8-stereocenters. The reaction initiates with a Heck-type addition to generate a &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-allyl-Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species, followed by a photoredox process or ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) to generate an allylic radical, which undergoes homocoupling to give the final product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: From Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the developments in the light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols with PC. We report cases where the homogeneous systems can be interfaced with electrochemical tools or adapted in flow and where the PC are integrated in sensitized materials.








Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light&#8208;driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts (PC). After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of PC employed in solution or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.

         <title>DNA Tetrahedron&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Hairpin Assembly for in Situ Monitoring of Viral RNA in Host Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional system based on tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDN) for detecting and monitoring the release and replication of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genomic RNA in host cells. The system responds to the presence of viral RNA, utilizing a highly efficient TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly to produce specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals corresponding to the level of the target viral RNA.








Abstract
Viruses pose significant threats to global public health and have substantial socio&#8208;economic impacts. Developing rapid, sensitive, and specific in situ virus&#8208;detection technologies is crucial for tracking viral genome release, replication in host cells, and intercellular transmission, thus holding great promise in understanding viral infection mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, screening antiviral drugs, and formulating prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, we present a multifunctional tetrahedral DNA nanostructure (TDN)&#8208;based system designed to monitor viral RNA levels in host cells in situ. The system employs a TDN&#8208;based hyperbranched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction to achieve rapid and powerful signal amplification, generating specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals in response to target viral RNA. Using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we developed the THA@JEV system responding to JEV&#8208;RNA. This system demonstrated rapid and sensitive detection of JEV&#8208;RNA within 12 minutes in a cell&#8208;free environment, enabling real&#8208;time imaging of JEV&#8208;RNA in situ within host cells. The integrated TDN structure enhanced the biological stability of the probes and ensured their reliability under various stress conditions and microenvironments. This TDN&#8208;based sensor system shows significant potential for elucidating viral infection pathways and advancing related virology research, as well as for screening antiviral drugs.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks of Silicone Elastomers via Organoborane Lewis&#8208;Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPNs) have been developed in recent years to offer distinctive mechanical properties and shape responsiveness in thermoset materials, thereby bestowing them with desirable characteristics such as self&#8208;healing and recyclability. To achieve these desirable properties, dynamic polymers incorporate reversible covalent bonds that enable shape morphing without causing irreversible chemical degradation of the network structure. Lewis pairs (LP), forming coordinate/dative covalent bonds, exhibit a broad range of bond dissociation rates and energies, making them inherently interesting for designing DCPNs. However, LPs have been relatively unexplored as polymer building blocks. Here, we present a straightforward approach to prepare LP&#8208;based polymers based on archetypical LPs, and amine&#8208;borane adducts with an organoborane functionalised polydimethylsiloxane combined with commercially available Lewis base (LB) polymers. The dynamic behavior of the organoborane&#8208;functionalised system and LB polymers is investigated, demonstrating tunable reversibility in cured elastomers. The excess of LB facilitates rapid recapture and reformation of the covalent network, contributing to the system's reversible and self&#8208;healing nature. Notably, the system allows easy mixing of different LB polymers, enabling the creation of tuning the system and hence organoborane&#8208;based Lewis pairs are demonstrated to be a promising building block for tunable dynamic covalent polymer networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Waste&#8208;Free Isolation of High Purity Primary Amines from Amine and Reaction Mixtures by Selective Ammonium Carbamate Crystallization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation of primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines presents a significant challenge in their sustainable production, and existing strategies are either multi&#8208;step, energy&#8208;demanding, or waste&#8208;intensive. We present an efficient process that utilizes the distinct solubility profiles of ammonium carbamate species formed through waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation of primary amines and CO2. This Selective Ammonium Carbamate Crystallization (SACC) enables the purification of challenging amine mixtures. Starting from 35% initial primary amine purity, SACC achieves very high isolated yields of up to 94% and excellent purities exceeding 99%. Additionally, the separation of secondary from tertiary amines with 86% yield and 91% purity and the fractional crystallization of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines with yields ranging from 83% to 94% and purities from 90% to &gt;99% were successfully achieved. SACC was also successfully employed in the alcohol amination with ammonia/ammonia alkylation to isolate primary amines with high yields of up to 84% and excellent purities exceeding 99% using a homogeneous Ru/Xantphos catalyst system. The observed average metal and phosphorus losses were at a minimal level of &lt;1&#160;wt% of the initial amounts. Based on this high catalyst retention, the additional potential of SACC for recycling the homogeneous catalyst was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>From Nanoparticles to Single Crystals of Al&#8208;MOFs: Synergistic Coordination and pH Modulation, and Rapid Sorption Kinetics Assessment by Optical Calorimetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), such as sorption kinetics or mechanical and chemical stability, not only depend on their composition and chemical structure, but also on their crystal size and morphology. However, the tunability of the crystallite size of aluminum&#8208;based MOFs (Al&#8208;MOFs) is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this study, we present systematic high&#8208;throughput investigations elucidating the synergistic effects of different mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids (acetic acid, malonic acid and oxalic acid) as coordination modulators and NaOH as a pH modulator on the crystal size of various Al&#8208;MOFs, with a focus on Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2. By varying the type and amount of coordination modulators, we successfully extended the range of achievable particle sizes to nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax &#8776; 100 nm &#8211; 800 &#181;m) compared to traditional synthesis methods using only coordination modulators. Thus, large crystals as well as nanoparticles of different Al&#8208;MOFs could be obtained by simply varying the molar ratio of the different modulators. Additionally, we explored the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties using InfraSORP technology (optical calorimetry), revealing the increase in adsorption rates with decreasing particle size.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Cctahedral and one with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3 at elevated temperature results in the formation of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the compound crystallizes in two different polymorphs obtained as bulk samples. In both structures the Pd2+ cations are coordinated by six oxygen atoms in form of an almost perfect octahedron. All oxygen atoms belong to the borosulfate anions [B(S2O7)2]&#8211; and link via Pd2+ cations to an extended network structure. Within the uncommon octahedral oxygen coordination, the Pd2+ cations reveal a d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to paramagnetism. Occasionally, red crystals are formed during the reaction next to the major fraction of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2 with Pd2+ in square&#8208;planar coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Study on Phosphorus Compound/Catechol&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amidation and Its Database Development for Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report that the catalytic activity of phosphorus compounds with a P&#8211;H bond in dehydrative amidation reactions is substantially enhanced when using catechol derivatives as additives. A systematic investigation into the catalytic activity of four phosphorus compounds and 17 catechol derivatives allowed identifying several effective combinations, e.g., dimethyl phosphite and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene, for the catalytic amidation of carboxylic acids with amines. The developed catalytic system enables the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and facilitates the amidation of anilines, which are typically considered poor substrates with low reactivity. In addition, machine&#8208;learning models were constructed to validate the effectiveness of the database generated from the above&#8208;mentioned investigation. Multilayer perceptron models incorporating descriptors derived from both quantum chemical calculations and RDKit provided accurate predictions while maintaining chemical interpretability, which was underscored by a visual analysis using SHAP.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Fluorophore with Enhanced Emission: Insights Into Photophysical Properties Through Proton Transfer Mapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, presenting an ESIPT, exhibits also a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence intensity. The modelization of the energy landscapes, combining proton transfer or deprotonation with rotations of substituents, demonstrates the existence of nonemissive conformations and rationalizes the experimental emission properties.








Abstract
A comprehensive study of a single&#8208;benzene fluorophore, characterized by a low molecular weight and a significant Stokes&#8217; shift, is reported. The fluorophore exhibits crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement and pH&#8208;dependent luminescence, attributable to a conformational lock in the crystalline state and suppression of nonemissive forms upon deprotonation. Extensive photophysical analysis reveals a quantum yield increase from 1% in solution to 22% in the solid state, along with a consistent emission wavelength irrespective of the state. Theoretical calculations show that the Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) mechanism is facilitated by the unique orientation of acetyl substituents and a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in the solid state and rationalized the large Stokes&#8217; shift observed. We explore the role of crystallization and intramolecular interactions in modifying the photophysical behavior of the fluorophore, emphasizing the absence of solvatochromism and the distinctive absence of strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Further theoretical modeling underscores the interplay between geometric conformation and proton transfer in determining emission properties, which is dramatically altered upon deprotonation. Therefore, detailed theoretical approaches to comprehensively map the complete photophysical landscape offer critical insights for the design and synthesis of small molecules that outperform larger fluorophores while retaining stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Conformational Switch in the Alpha&#8208;Synuclein C&#8208;Terminal Domain Directs Its Fibril Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational state of the C&#8208;terminal domain determines the fibril morphology of full&#8208;length wild&#8208;type alpha&#8208;synuclein: high C&#8208;terminus flexibility promotes twisted fibrils, while partial C&#8208;terminal folding drives the assembly of rod&#8208;like fibrils.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;Syn) inclusions are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders. While cryo&#8208;electron microscopy studies have revealed distinct fibril polymorphs across different synucleinopathies, the molecular switches controlling polymorphism remain unveiled. In this study, we found that fibril morphology is associated with the conformational state of monomeric &#945;Syn. Through systematic evaluation of the ionic strength and temperature, we generated two distinct polymorphs: a twisted morphology at low ionic strength and temperature, and a rod&#8208;like morphology at higher ionic strength and temperature. Using solid&#8208;state NMR, we revealed that both polymorphs share a highly conserved core structure, with morphological differences arising probably from distinct structural arrangements at the protofilament interfaces. Furthermore, we found that a specific conformational change in the C&#8208;terminal domain of the monomeric &#945;Syn serves as a molecular switch for the formation of polymorphs. Interestingly, this conformational change can also be triggered by calcium binding to the C&#8208;terminus, connecting environmental factors to specific fibril architectures. Our results reveal a conformational role for the C&#8208;terminal domain that influences &#945;Syn fibril morphology, providing significant insights into the fibrogenesis of &#945;Syn.

         <title>Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TzTz derivatives are promising materials for flexible optoelectronic and sensing applications due to their easy synthesis, tunable properties, and stability. This study analyzes 10 TzTz derivatives, detailing their synthesis, spectroscopic characterization (FTIR, NMR, UV&#8208;Vis), fluorescence behavior, and synchrotron XANES findings, showcasing their potential for advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted thiazolothiazole (TzTz) derivatives including imidazolyl, o&#8208;vanillyl, p&#8208;vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K&#8208;edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4&#160;eV in solution and up to 1&#160;eV in solid state and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.

&lt;p&gt;TzTz derivatives are promising materials for flexible optoelectronic and sensing applications due to their easy synthesis, tunable properties, and stability. This study analyzes 10 TzTz derivatives, detailing their synthesis, spectroscopic characterization (FTIR, NMR, UV-Vis), fluorescence behavior, and synchrotron XANES findings, showcasing their potential for advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;-conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted thiazolothiazole (TzTz) derivatives including imidazolyl, &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-vanillyl, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X-ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K-edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4&#160;eV in solution and up to 1&#160;eV in solid state and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DFT&#8208;Guided Synthesis, Electrochemical, and Photophysical Properties of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Featuring Flavin&#8208;Inspired &#960;&#8208;Extended Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties as well as the multielectron storage capacity of a several ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes with flavin&#8208;inspired &#960;&#8208;extended ligands are investigated in a joint synthetic&#8208;spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven electron transfer and subsequent multielectron storage is among the key aspects of photochemical reactions in artificial photosynthesis and molecular electronics. Following our previously introduced design and characterization of Ru(II)&#8208;based photosensitizers, four new Ru complexes with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands featuring a flavin&#8208;inspired subunit were investigated via density functional theory in order to evaluate their electrochemical properties ahead of a time and resource&#8208;demanding synthesis. Two complexes, Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB and Ru&#8208;Me2deazaalloxB, with a bent ligand architecture, were identified as promising candidates for application in light&#8208;driven charge accumulation and subsequently synthesized. The electrochemical characterization of Ru&#8208;Me2alloxB confirmed the theoretical predictions and its photophysical properties were investigated using UV/Vis absorption, resonance Raman, time&#8208;resolved emission, and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical simulations. Furthermore, first insights into the electronic distribution in the singly reduced complex were modelled computationally and obtained by EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. These results underline the promising multielectron storage capacity of the newly designed &#960;&#8208;extended alloxazine ligand.

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) Decorated with a High Density of Photochemically Switchable Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable azo ligands can be conjugated to the surface of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles with a high density (about 50 ligands on each nanoparticle). Their photoswitching is not constrained by the binding to the gold surface and can be used to induce a nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition in a liquid crystal.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) were surface&#8208;coated with photoswitchable 3&#8208;azopyridine ligands by ligand exchange with n&#8208;dodecanethiol&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles. Each gold nanoparticle carried about 66 dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands and 49 azo ligands. The azo ligands were reversibly switchable between the stable E&#8208; and the metastable Z&#8208;isomer by UV and green light irradiation as shown by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The photoswitching was not significantly affected by the conjugation of the azo ligand to the nanoparticle surface, despite the high density of ligands on the particle surface. This offers a pathway for photoswitchable systems on the nanoscale, for example, to manipulate supramolecular systems. The introduction of 0.5 wt% of the nanoparticles into a liquid crystalline host yielded a photoresponsive material which showed a reversible nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition upon irradiation

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Methods Induce Different Individual&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Block Solvation Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An understanding of block&#8208;specific responses to stimuli in self&#8208;assembled copolymers is essential for the effective design of responsive materials. Here, materials formed from different post&#8208;reaction processing methods of the same ROMP block copolymer exhibit different block&#8208;specific solvent responses, as characterized in situ by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). FLIM data were acquired by tagging the polar or nonpolar block separately with a covalently incorporated viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent molecular rotor to measure the changing tightness or looseness of assembly upon changes in solvent composition. Rapid precipitation from an insoluble solvent to form a film results in tighter assembly and less difference in tightness/looseness between the two blocks. Further, it interrupts individual block&#8208;solvent response behavior. Both results indicate an apparent disruption of the core&#8211;shell assembly. This model from FLIM is further supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data from isolated solids, which show tighter long&#8208;range interactions and more long&#8208;rage order in these kinetically trapped states. The experiments develop FLIM as a method for pinpointing stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors from different processing methods to individual blocks. Together these outcomes provide a future handle for tailoring solvent&#8208;triggered assembly/disassembly behavior.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the 5/5/5/6 caged&#8208;like natural product daphnenoid A has been accomplished for the first time. The synthesis features NHK coupling to prepare a precursor (12) and a Michael/Michael cascade to forge a norbornane scaffold.








Abstract
Total synthesis of the 5/5/5/6 caged&#8208;like natural product daphnenoid A was accomplished for the first time. The de novo synthesis started with the commercially available (R)&#8208;carvone. A key Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi reaction was employed to build the precusor for the stepwise Mukaiyama Michael/Michael cascade which constructed a norbornane substructure. The caged tetracarbocyclic skeleton was forged using the ring closure metathesis.

         <title>Polypyrrole as a Photothermal Reactor to Conduct Solvent&#8208;Free Pericyclic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polypyrrole photothermal materials can serve as reactors for conducting solvent&#8208;free pericyclic reactions (such as Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, and electrocyclizations) with yields of up to 90% under irradiation by halogen lamp. The photothermal reactor is recyclable, scalable, and energy&#8208;efficient, offering a green and sustainable strategy for organic synthesis.








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free organic reactions have proven to be a sustainable strategy in organic synthesis, such as&#160;mechanochemical, microwave&#8208;assisted, and ultrasound&#8208;irradiated methods. As a complementary strategy, photothermal materials may also be used in solvent&#8208;free chemistry. Polypyrroles, the black conjugated polymers, feature facile synthesis, high stability, and excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability, enabling them to serve as photothermal reactors to conduct solvent&#8208;free thermal&#8208;induced reactions. Here, a series of polypyrroles have been synthesized in the presence of various surfactants. The usage of dodecyl dimethyl betaine afforded PPy&#8208;BS, which achieved the highest photothermal performance (241&#176;C under 100&#160;W halogen&#8208;lamp irradiation). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller (BET) analyses suggest that the excellent photothermal performance of PPy&#8208;BS is likely attributed to the well&#8208;organized assembly based on the uniform particle. On this basis, PPy&#8208;BS was employed as a photothermal reactor for Diels&#8208;Alder, dipolar cycloaddition, and electrocyclization reactions under solvent&#8208;free conditions. All trials afforded good to excellent yields up to 90%. Notably, PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactor exhibits excellent recyclability, a high loading amount of substrates, and upscaling to 1000&#160;mg per batch. In brief, this study highlights the advantages of PPy&#8208;BS photothermal reactors for pericyclic reactions, offering a recyclable, up&#8208;scalable, and solvent&#8208;free platform for sustainable organic synthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvent-free organic reactions have proven to be a sustainable strategy in organic synthesis, such as&#160;mechanochemical, microwave-assisted, and ultrasound-irradiated methods. As a complementary strategy, photothermal materials may also be used in solvent-free chemistry. Polypyrroles, the black conjugated polymers, feature facile synthesis, high stability, and excellent light-harvesting capability, enabling them to serve as photothermal reactors to conduct solvent-free thermal-induced reactions. Here, a series of polypyrroles have been synthesized in the presence of various surfactants. The usage of dodecyl dimethyl betaine afforded &lt;b&gt;PPy-BS&lt;/b&gt;, which achieved the highest photothermal performance (241&#176;C under 100&#160;W halogen-lamp irradiation). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses suggest that the excellent photothermal performance of &lt;b&gt;PPy-BS&lt;/b&gt; is likely attributed to the well-organized assembly based on the uniform particle. On this basis, &lt;b&gt;PPy-BS&lt;/b&gt; was employed as a photothermal reactor for Diels-Alder, dipolar cycloaddition, and electrocyclization reactions under solvent-free conditions. All trials afforded good to excellent yields up to 90%. Notably, &lt;b&gt;PPy-BS&lt;/b&gt; photothermal reactor exhibits excellent recyclability, a high loading amount of substrates, and upscaling to 1000&#160;mg per batch. In brief, this study highlights the advantages of &lt;b&gt;PPy-BS&lt;/b&gt; photothermal reactors for pericyclic reactions, offering a recyclable, up-scalable, and solvent-free platform for sustainable organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diameter Controllable Separation of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes by Simply Changing the Metal in Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discover a novel approach for diameter&#8208;selective separation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal&#8208;coordinating supramolecular polymers (M&#8208;PNB) consisting of phenanthroline&#8208;based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). Due to notable disparity in the dihedral angle of the metal&#8208;phenanthroline complex (M(phen)2), Pd&#8208; and Co&#8208;PNB preferentially extract smaller (0.90&#8211;0.92 nm) and larger (0.97&#8211;1.10 nm) diameter ranges, respectively. Moreover, the combinations of these separations (Pd&#8208;PNB/Co&#8208;PNB and Pd/Co&#8208;PNB) are found to enhance the selectivity.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic and optical properties that are highly dependent on their structures. Therefore, diameter&#8208;selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present a novel approach for size&#8208;tunable diameter separation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal&#8208;coordinating supramolecular polymers (M&#8208;PNB) consisting of phenanthroline&#8208;based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with M&#8208;PNB is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with PNB show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 &#8211; 0.92&#160;nm) and the larger (0.97 &#8211; 1.10&#160;nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in M&#8208;PNB is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)&#8208;SWNTs. This method offers not only size&#8208;tunable diameter selectivity but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques.

         <dc:description>
First report on 7&#8208;membered cyclic nucleotides, 2',3'&#8208;cNTDPs, obtained from all&#8208;natural free ribonucleosides in robust, step&#8208;economic synthesis involving instantaneous and regio&#8208;selective reaction. DFT calculations confirmed the feasibility of 7&#8208;membered cyclic nucleotide formation and deciphered the basis for regioselectivity. 2',3'&#8208;cNTDPs were characterized by their solution conformation, hydrolytic stability, and acidity.








Abstract
7&#8208;membered cyclic nucleotides have remained unknown despite the natural abundance of their 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered counterparts. Here, we report the first synthesis of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic nucleosides (tetrathio)diphosphonate (2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cNTDPs) by a rapid one&#8208;step, regioselective, and protection&#8208;free reaction of U, A, C, I, and G, with methylene&#8208;bis(1,3,2&#8208;dithia&#8208;phospholane&#8208;2&#8208;sulfide) (DTPS). The reaction proceeds instantaneously, even at &#8208;35 &#176;C, resulting in the quantitative conversion of methylene&#8208;bis&#8208;DTPS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of &#8710;Gr confirm the synthetic feasibility and regioselectivity, attributing the efficiency to strain release in DTPS rings and entropic gain from thiirane elimination. The resulting 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cNTDPs exhibited remarkable hydrolytic stability and greater solution structural rigidity than free nucleosides.

         <title>Tunable Emission in Cu(I)/Mn(II) Codoped 2D Hybrid Cd Chloride Perovskites for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes and Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu+/Mn2+&#8208;codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites with tunable emission are synthesized. Cu+ and Mn2+ can lead to green STE emission and orange&#8208;red emission from Mn2+ 4T1&#8594;6A1 transitions, respectively. Interestingly, the two emission centers contribute to high&#8208;efficiency tunable white light emission.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it remains challenging to achieve highly efficient white light emission in 2D systems. Herein, white light emitting Cu+/Mn2+ codoped 2D (PPDA)CdCl4 perovskites are synthesized via a facile fabrication method. The host is weakly emissive. However, Cu+ and Mn2+ doping can lead to strong green and orange&#8208;red emission, respectively. Spectroscopic characterizations show that there are two independent emission centers, the Cu+&#8208;induced extrinsic self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE), which leads to the green emission, and the isolated Mn2+ ion which results in orange&#8208;red emission via the inherent 4T1(G)&#8594;6A1(S) transition. Interestingly, by optimizing the ratio of Cu+ and Mn2+, the codoped sample can exhibit tunable white light emission with variable correlated color temperatures and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 45.2%&#8211;51.1%. In addition, the codoped samples can also exhibit interesting excitation&#8208;dependent emission properties. This work opens up new opportunities for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite luminescent materials.

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Annual global economic losses from equipment icing exceed USD 180 billion, with indirect losses being even harder to quantify. Coatings are a highly effective method for preventing equipment from freezing. This paper reviews the research progress of anti&#8208;icing coatings and analyzes future development trends. It evaluates the anti&#8208;icing capabilities of superhydrophobic coatings, slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), and energy&#8208;conversion coatings based on their material characteristics and anti&#8208;icing mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper examines the anti&#8208;icing applications of single&#8208;and multi&#8208;functional coatings, assesses the advantages and disadvantages of their preparation technologies and material properties, and identifies the main problems in practical applications of current anti&#8208;icing coatings. Finally, it highlights the potential of active anti&#8208;icing functional coatings, particularly energy&#8208;conversion coatings. Through interdisciplinary material innovation and technological exploration, these coatings could enable all&#8208;weather and sustainable anti&#8208;icing solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Construction of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 Heterostructure for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of an electrocatalyst that integrates both high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness to enhance the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water reduction constitutes a significant scientific challenge. Herein, we present an electrocatalyst that RuS2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed onto MoO3/MoS2 nanosheets support to obtain abundant heterojunction interfaces of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction. It enhanced the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation and optimizing the reaction kinetics. RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for alkaline HER, showing a low overpotential of only 51 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most previously reported alkaline HER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it also has outstanding long&#8208;term stability, capable of maintaining current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for durations exceeding 500 hours and 100 hours under the chronoamperometric method, respectively. This research offers novel insights and clear guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective RuS2 electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Key Ferredoxins for Nitrogen Fixation Have Different Specificities and Biophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, are collectively essential for the process of nitrogen fixation by the iron nitrogenase in R. capsulatus. We explore the biophysical factors, through spectroscopic and structural characterizations, which determine ferredoxin functionality and pathway specificity. The structure of FdC (PDB: 9I2A) and model of FdN (AF&#8208;D5ARY6) are shown, nitrogen fixation by the iron nitrogenase is depicted (PDB: 8OIE).








Abstract
Ferredoxins deliver electrons to drive many challenging biochemical transformations, including enzyme&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. We recently showed two distinct ferredoxins, FdC and FdN, were essential for iron nitrogenase&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation in R. capsulatus. In this study, we perform investigations on FdC and FdN to establish their key differences in terms of specificity, structure, and electronic properties. In vivo complementation studies of both the genes encoding FdC (fdxC) and FdN (fdxN), into &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN R. capsulatus&#8208;deletion strains under N2&#8208;fixing conditions, showed that plasmid&#8208;based expression of fdxN recovered diazotrophic growth and Fe&#8208;nitrogenase activity in both &#8710;fdxC and &#8710;fdxN strains, while plasmid&#8208;based fdxC expression could only complement the &#8710;fdxC strain. Spectroscopic analysis of FdC and FdN using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed large differences in the electronic features of FdC and FdN. These differences were accompanied by large structural differences between FdC and FdN, assessed by a crystallographic structure of FdC and an AlphaFold model of FdN. We report novel features in the FdC structure, in terms of secondary structure and hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, compared with structures of other [Fe2S2]&#8208;cluster ferredoxins. Overall, we explore the biophysical properties that influence ferredoxin specificity, while providing new insights into the properties of ferredoxins essential for N2&#8208;fixation.

         <title>Solvent Effect on the Chiral Arrangement for Two Achiral Metal&#8208;Organic Colloids in the Vortex Field: Rheological Study and Retention Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloids with similar chemical components but different solvents exhibit distinct vortex&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. Rheological studies reveal that the strong solvent&#8208;colloidal particle interactions are the underlying reason why the colloid can generate dynamic chiral arrangement and exhibit chiroptical properties.








Abstract
The vortex features a helical structure and exhibits macroscopic chirality. Over the past few decades, scientists have observed that several achiral compounds display chiroptical activity within the vortex field. The researchers believe that chiral arrangement may have occurred in this process. Herein, we investigate two achiral metal&#8208;organic colloids (Zn3L/DMSO and Zn3L/DMF) which have similar chemical components but exhibit distinct vortex&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. In the vortex field, the Zn3L/DMSO colloid presents chiroptical activity, whereas the Zn3L/DMF colloid remains chiroptically silent. Rheological studies reveal the possible underlying reasons. The strong solvent&#8208;colloidal particles interactions in the Zn3L/DMSO colloid endow the system with excellent viscoelasticity and reversible thixotropy. These characteristics enable the Zn3L/DMSO colloid to form a reversible chiral arrangement within the vortex. In contrast, the Zn3L/DMF colloid fails to respond to the vortex. Furthermore, the addition of the charged molecule D enhanced the rheological properties of the Zn3L/DMSO colloid, with the potential to preserve its chiroptical activity. Overall, this research is expected to provide new insights into the vortex&#8208;induced chirality of supramolecular colloids, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of chiroptical property in such systems.

         <title>Hybrid Inorganic&#8208;Organic Rotaxanes and Related Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of HRMs over the last 10 years is presented, including aspects of their supramolecular chemistry, magnetic properties, and applications.








Abstract
The extension of previous studies of heterometallic rings (HMRs) is described, including new synthetic chemistry and physics. These HMRs feature a ring of, typically, eight metal centers with a central charge&#8208;balancing cation. New HMRs and related molecules are described, varying the number of metals present. The eight metal HMRs have been used as components of larger supramolecular assembly, most often by making the HMRs into [2]rotaxanes or pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes, where the thread of the rotaxane is terminated by a binding group such as pyridine. This allows the formation of [n]rotaxanes, where n&#160;=&#160;3, 4, 5,7, 13, or 1014. Mass spectrometry and NMR studies of the HMRs have given greater understanding of the host&#8208;guest chemistry of these metal analogues of crown ethers. Physical studies have included 4D&#8208;inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and continuous wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure magnetic interactions between spin components of the supramolecular assemblies. The use of the HMRs as resists for high&#8208;resolution lithography is also discussed.

Native mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trisaccharides are converted into p&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides in a one&#8208;pot reaction using water as the solvent. A sequence of condensation reactions is used to construct the aromatic ring from acyclic precursors. Using this approach, a modular synthesis of SGLT2&#8208;inhibitor scaffolds was developed and applied to a novel protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of a nanomolar SGLT2 inhibitor.








Abstract
The synthesis of p&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from native mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trisaccharides is described. The one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step procedure uses water as the solvent and produces exclusively &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, the desired stereochemistry for most medicinal chemistry applications. The versatility of the approach is illustrated by the synthesis of the nanomolar SGLT2 inhibitor [3&#8208;(4&#8208;ethylbenzyl)phenyl]&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glucoside.

         <title>Amination of 1&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;Bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;Sulfonic Acid Enabled by Alternating Current Electrolysis of Symmetrical Copper Electrodes</title>

Amination of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (BAA) is achieved by alternating current (AC) electrolysis on symmetrical Cu electrodes without the need for CuCl or CuSO4 with SnCl2. The application of AC enables the formation of the Cu2O passivation film on both copper electrode surfaces, allowing continuous generation of Cu+ for catalyzing BAA amination.








Abstract
Amination of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone&#8208;type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a innovative strategy for the in situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post&#8208;treatment. Characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal that the passive Cu2O film formed on the symmetrical Cu electrodes under AC electrolysis continuously generates Cu+, which is crucial for the reaction. This approach is scalable, environmentally friendly, and holds great potential for industrial applications, offering substantial economic benefits while reducing environmental impact.

         <title>Recent Advances in Detergent Chemistry and Handling Support Membrane Protein Analysis Including Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detergent design parameters determine experimental successes in membrane protein research. Recent progresses in detergent chemistry are reviewed to promote the top&#8208;down design of non&#8208;ionic detergents for the purification and analysis of intact membrane proteins, including lipid interactions.








Abstract
Non&#8208;ionic detergents are key reagents for the characterization of membrane protein drug targets. Suitable detergents are commonly identified by trial and error, which leads to failed preparations and raising costs. Recent findings suggest that not only the chemistry of detergents but also the strategy with which detergents and proteins are brought together impact the successes of investigations. To facilitate the future development of non&#8208;ionic detergents in membrane protein research, herein, we review chemical design concepts and detergent exchange strategies for a successful integration of detergents into the analysis of challenging membrane protein complexes. Our overview reveals exciting opportunities to tackle existing challenges, including the stabilization of G&#8208;protein coupled receptors, the development of fluorinated detergents for studying protein&#8211;lipid binding, top&#8208;down design of detergents, and hybrid detergents for the identification of non&#8208;canonical lipid associations to proteins with relevance to antibiotic research. Our review will facilitate the development of chemical tools for the biophysical characterization of membrane proteins and support the discovery of biological findings in the&#160;future.

         <title>Intramolecular PCET of &#945;&#8208;Keto Acids: Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl Ketones via Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids have conventionally served as simple building blocks for the generation of nucleophilic acyl radicals. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct approach for this substrate class, showcasing the generation of ketyl radicals through a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. Coupled with aryl olefins, this approach allows for the generation of butyrolactones, a functional intermediate for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones (TFMKs), in a net dicarbofunctionalization of aryl olefins.









Abstract
Due to favourable pharmacological properties, the introduction of the fluorine atom into small molecules has become increasingly more common over the past few decades. In particular, the trifluoromethyl ketone group is of great interest due to its role as a carboxylic acid bioisostere. Recently, these fragments have been accessed via acyl radical equivalents. Herein, we disclose an unconventional intramolecular proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer activation of &#945;&#8208;keto acids by photoredox catalysis to generate ketyl radicals toward accessing functionalizable lactones. These lactones serve as synthons for modular one&#8208;pot syntheses of trifluoromethyl ketones in a net dicarbofunctionalization of electron&#8208;rich olefins.

         <title>Matrix Isolation and Solvation of the Benzonitrile Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrated electrons are potent reducing agents that may play significant roles in chemical evolution within astrochemical and prebiotic environments. Benzonitrile, a molecule present in the interstellar medium (ISM), can capture electrons in amorphous water ice at cryogenic temperatures, forming a radical anion. This radical anion engages in hydrogen bonding with surrounding water molecules, interactions that can be characterized using infrared (IR) spectroscopy.








Abstract
Solvated electrons, one of the strongest reducing agents, exhibit short lifetimes in the range of pico&#8208; to milliseconds when generated photochemically or by radiolysis in solution. In contrast, solvated electrons produced using sodium metal in liquid ammonia are stable for days and have long been used in synthetic chemistry. Using sodium atoms as an electron source, we were able to trap solvated electrons in low&#8208;density amorphous (LDA) water ice matrices with lifetimes of several days and use these electrons as reducing reagents. In LDA matrices doped with benzonitrile 1, these electrons react with 1 to form the benzonitrile radical anion 2. In argon matrices, in the absence of water, only small amounts of 2 were observed after deposition, and most of the sodium and 1 remained unreacted. The yield of radical anion 2 is significantly higher in amorphous water ice than in solid argon. The photoexcitation of radical anion 2 in both argon and LDA water ice matrices resulted in a reversal of the electron transfer under back formation of benzonitrile 1. Annealing of argon matrices doped with small amounts of water containing 2 resulted in the formation of 1:1 and 2:1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes between water and radical anion 2.

         <title>Multifunctional Nano&#8208;COF&#8208;Embedded Silica Composite for Efficient Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite material integrating &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked nano TPTTA COFs and a rhodium complex electron mediator into a mesoporous silica matrix is reported for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This design enhances electron transfer, achieving a 75.7% NADH yield, 89.8% selectivity, and an initial rate of 8.7 gNADH&#8226;gCat&#8722;1&#8226;h&#8722;1, with stable performance over four cycles.








Abstract
The photocatalytic regeneration of NADH represents an effective means of mimicking photosynthesis, but confronts the challenges of the charge separation, electron transfer, and the selectivity control in the surface reduction stage. Herein, we report a multifunctional composite material that embeds &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked nano TPTTA covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and electron mediator (rhodium complex, [Cp*Rh(bpy) (H2O)Cl2] into a functional mesoporous silica matrix for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This strategy enables the facilitation of the electron transfer process while maintaining the intrinsic properties of the COFs, providing flexibility in COFs design. The strategic integration of electron mediator and the shortened charge migration path due to the nanosized COFs results in an NADH regeneration yield of 75.7% and a selectivity of 89.8% for 1,4&#8208;NADH. The initial reaction rate for NADH regeneration attained 8.7 gNADH&#8226;gCat&#8722;1&#8226;h&#8722;1, and the system showed no decrease in activity after four reaction cycles.

         <title>Balancing Antigen Loading on Gold Nanoparticles: Implications for Future Cancer Vaccine Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a promising antigen for cancer vaccine development, but its low immunogenicity poses a major challenge. In this study, we have investigated the effect of varying the surface density of an artificial MUC1 glycopeptide on gold nanoparticles by co&#8208;loading them with an ovalbumin&#8208;derived peptide. Our results show that reducing the density of the MUC1 antigen on the nanoparticles does not affect the elicited immune response, as high IgG antibody levels were observed in the immunized mice, which were comparable to those obtained with higher antigen loading. These antibodies effectively reacted with natural MUC1 expressed on breast cancer cells, promoted antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity and specifically recognized cancer tissue in immunohistochemical assays. This work could form the basis for the development of AuNP&#8208;based multicomponent vaccines that will allow the incorporation of additional immunostimulatory or complementary antigens in the future without compromising the efficacy of the MUC1 antigen.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible, Perfluorinated Analog of Aluminum Fumarate Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel flexible perfluorinated Al&#8208;MOF is discovered, highlighting the impact of linker fluorination on structural flexibility and sorption&#160;properties.








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of Al&#8208;TFS, a novel aluminum metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on tetrafluorosuccinic acid (H2TFS), of formula Al(OH)(TFS)&#183;1.5H2O, introducing a new member to the family of perfluorinated MOFs. The structure of the MOF, solved ab&#8208;initio from laboratory powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, displays analogies with that of the commercially available Al&#8208;fumarate (Basolite A520). The structure is composed of 1D infinite OH&#8208;bridged AlO6 octahedra chains connected by the dicarboxylic linkers, designing rhombic channels decorated by fluorine atoms. Upon water removal, the MOF undergoes a phase transition leading to a moderate expansion of the unit cell. Volumetric analysis revealed the presence of ultra&#8208;micropores with a size lower than 4 &#197;. Gas sorption measurements demonstrated for Al&#8208;TFS a slightly higher CO2 selectivity compared to N2 and CH4 than the Al&#8208;fumarate analog, with peculiar shapes of the isotherms suggesting a dynamic response of the framework to CO2 adsorption. Using different complementary techniques (in situ infrared spectroscopy, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas/vapor sorption), and density functional theory simulations, the flexibility of the new MOF was disclosed, highlighting the significant impact of fluorination in tailoring materials with structural flexibility and peculiar adsorption properties.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies and Phosphorus&#8208;Doped P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC Electrocatalysts Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a phosphorus&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide with OV (P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC) as an efficient electrocatalyst for HER in the acidic environments. We indicate that P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC exhibits a low overpotential (122.68&#160;mV @ &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), a small Tafel slope (74.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), and excellent durability over 12 hours.








Abstract
Constructing nonprecious metal electrocatalysts with good hydrogen evolution activity is crucial for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. The synergistic optimization of the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption steps presents a challenge for the HER. Here, we have synthesized phosphorus&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide with oxygen vacancies(OV) (P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x) using a simple but effective hydrothermal reaction followed by calcination annealing. Interestingly, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x material exhibits unique characteristics that set it apart from conventional tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The introduction of OV and phosphorus doping creates an optimal structure that significantly improves the electronic properties and the catalytic sites. The OV enhance the material's ability to adsorb and activate water molecules, while phosphorus doping further modifies the electronic structure, facilitating more efficient hydrogen desorption. Meanwhile, the catalyst demonstrates a favorable urchin&#8208;like morphology with excellent supportability. Remarkably, the P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent HER performance and excellent durability. We indicate that P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x exhibits a small overpotential (122.68&#160;mV at &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), a low Tafel slope (74.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), and excellent durability over 12 hours. This work presents a significant advance for the development of tungsten oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts with anion doping and OV for HER in acidic media.

         <title>Expanded Structural Design of Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals Based on Linear Tris&#8208;Pyrrolidinium Salt</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts was designed to expand the structural versatility of organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs). These compounds exhibit multiple solid&#8211;solid phase transitions and high electrochemical stability. Their composites with Li salts show significantly enhanced ionic conductivity.








Abstract
Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter&#8208;anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8242;&#8208;undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium trishexafluorophosphate (11&#8208;PF6) exhibited two solid&#8208;solid phase transitions and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13&#160;J&#183;K&#8722;1&#183;mol&#8722;1 at 210&#160;&#176;C. Similarly, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8242;&#8208;dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (12&#8208;PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &#916;Sf of 18&#160;J&#183;K&#8722;1&#183;mol&#8722;1 at 206&#160;&#176;C. The temperature&#8208;dependent soft crystalline phases of 11&#8208;PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11&#8208;PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S&#183;cm&#8722;1 at 70&#160;&#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S&#183;cm&#8722;1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11&#8208;PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4&#160;V (versus Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;voltage electrolyte component.

&lt;p&gt;Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris-pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter-anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-bis(4-(&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium trishexafluorophosphate (&lt;b&gt;11-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited two solid-solid phase transitions and a low fusion entropy (&lt;i&gt;&#916;S&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) of 13&#160;J&#183;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 210&#160;&#176;C. Similarly, &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-bis(4-(&lt;i&gt;N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris-hexafluorophosphate (&lt;b&gt;12-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &lt;i&gt;&#916;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; of 18&#160;J&#183;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 206&#160;&#176;C. The temperature-dependent soft crystalline phases of &lt;b&gt;11-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of &lt;b&gt;11-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was measured to be 2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; S&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 70&#160;&#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of &lt;b&gt;11-PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and 80 mol% LiTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4&#160;V (versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), highlighting its potential as a high-voltage electrolyte component.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ab Initio Study on Doped Cu138X2 Nanoparticles With Dispersed Surface&#8208;Active Sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction on heteroatom&#8208;doped Cu138X2 (X&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pd, Zn, Ni, Pt) catalysts. DFT calculations demonstrated that Cu138Au2 exhibits superior performance, with *NO2&#8594;*HNO2 identified as the critical reaction pathway and an effective descriptor for screening copper&#8208;based catalysts. This study lays a solid foundation for optimizing catalyst performance through surface and compositional modifications.








Abstract
Copper nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit significant potential in electrocatalysis owing to their tunable electronic structure and abundant surface&#8208;active sites. However, the multifaceted complexity of Cu&#8208;based nanoparticles induced by heteroatom dopants fundamentally limits our ability to decipher the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) mechanism, creating a critical knowledge gap that obstructs the targeted engineering of advanced catalysts with atomic precision. In this study, we employed first&#8208;principles calculations to design a series of highly surface&#8208;dispersed transition metal&#8208;doped Cu138X2 (X&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pd, Zn, Ni, Pt) bimetallic electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH3), based on the structure of Cu140 NPs. Theoretical analysis revealed that Cu138Au2 exhibits significant advantages in NO3RR, with a remarkably low limiting potential of &#8722;0.20 eV. In addition, significant energy barriers were observed for the formation of by&#8208;products NO and NO2 on Cu138Au2, ensuring high selectivity towards ammonia. For Cu&#8208;based catalysts, we propose that the *NO2 &#8594; *HNO2 step is critical and can serve as a descriptor for rapid screening of these catalysts. This study not only provides important insights into the research of Cu NPs as NO3RR electrocatalysts but also establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing their catalytic performance through surface modification or compositional tuning.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ammonium&#8208;Promoted&#8208;Proton Transfer for Photocatalysis of H2O2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs modified with methoxyl groups were successfully synthesized, which feature promising semiconducting activities and hydrophilicity. Upon treated with ammonium ions, the resultant COFs composites exhibited visible&#8208;light photocatalysis of H2O2 production with more than eight times higher in compared with neat COF samples.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as effective photocatalysts for the environmentally friendly synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under solar sunlight. Besides electron transfer in an ORR process, proton transport also serves as an important role in promoting kinetic rate, which was majorly improved via modifying the chemical structures of COFs, but seldom to be explored through a simple additive composition. In work, we report the preparation of two new vinylene&#8208;linked COFs termed g&#8208;TDM&#8208;COF and g&#8208;TBD&#8208;COF, respectively, by Knoevenagel condensation of trimethylpyridine (TMP) and 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP) or 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (DMBD). They were crystalized in a hexagonal lattice and adopting AA stacking modes. Their porous structures with high surface areas and micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;channels were revealed. The methoxyl substituents pended on and pyridine atoms embedded in the backbones of these COFs rendered them with hydrogen bond donating capabilities. Combined with their substantial semiconducting properties, the COFs enable photocatalysis of hydroperoxide (H2O2) production. Simply compositing these COFs with ammonium ions markedly improved the photoelectric properties, leading to an over eightfold enhancement of photocatalytic H2O2 production relative to the neat COFs, and an increase in apparent quantum yields (AQYs) from 0.70% to 4.22% at 500&#160;nm. Such a phenomenon could be attributed to the efficient interaction of ammonium ions with the COFs via hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, thus favorable for broadening light&#8208;harvesting, narrowing band gaps, and strengthening proton conductivity. As a consequence, their photocatalytic performance could be distinctly enhanced.

         <title>A Reductively Activatable Phototheranostic Agent Based on a Water&#8208;Soluble Nickel Naphthalocyanine Precursor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report describes the synthesis of nickel naphthalocyanine (NiNc) precursors bearing two alkoxy groups on their core structure and the evaluation as the turn&#8208;on&#8208;type photosensitizer for theranostics. In glutathione&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells, reductive conversion of the precursor proceeded efficiently, resulting in enhanced photoacoustic (PA) signal intensity and phototoxicity based on the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion of NiNc.








Abstract
Metal naphthalocyanine (MNc) is one of the most promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes as a photosensitizer for phototheranostics, combining photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the extremely low solubility of MNc has limited its practical application as a theranostic agent. In this research, we synthesized NiNc precursors (ox&#8208;NiNc) having two alkoxy groups on the &#945;&#8208;carbons of the diagonal pyrroles with significantly improved solubility. We also prepared an amphiphilic derivative, ox&#8208;NiNc&#8208;PEG, and investigated its conversion to NiNc through reductive aromatization. We demonstrated that ox&#8208;NiNc&#8208;PEG was efficiently converted to NiNc in cancer cells with elevated glutathione levels, resulting in enhanced photoacoustic signals and increased phototoxicity based on photothermal conversion under NIR light irradiation. The target&#8208;oriented reductive aromatization in response to the reducing environment in cancer cells offers a critical strategy for developing PAI/PTT theranostic agents.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]Propellane Promoted by Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an EnT&#8208;promoted photocatalytic strategy for the efficient synthesis of diverse C3&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides. This method enables the sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]propellane using readily available substrates under mild conditions, providing a sustainable and efficient route to BCP sulfonamides and facilitating their application as valuable building blocks in drug discovery.








Abstract
Sulfonamides represent an important structural motif present in numerous drugs, however, the scarcity of synthetic methods for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides has limited the applicability of this compound class. Herein, we report an energy transfer (EnT) promoted photocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides via sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]propellane. This approach utilizes N&#8208;nitrososulfonamides as precursors, facilitating the generation of sulfonamide radicals through homolytic cleavage under EnT promotion. These radicals were then found to engage in an addition reaction with [1.1.1]propellane, generating bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) radicals that undergo subsequent C&#9472;H, C&#9472;X, C&#9472;S, or C&#9472;C coupling reactions to afford a variety of C3&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides. This strategy featured mild conditions, operational simplicity, with high atomic utilization, and therefore not only offers an efficient synthesis of a range of C3&#8208;versatile&#8208;substituted BCP sulfonamides, but also significantly broadens the potential applicability of BCP&#8208;sulfonamides in drug discovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfonamides represent an important structural motif present in numerous drugs, however, the scarcity of synthetic methods for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides has limited the applicability of this compound class. Herein, we report an energy transfer (EnT) promoted photocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides via sulfonamidation of [1.1.1]propellane. This approach utilizes &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitrososulfonamides as precursors, facilitating the generation of sulfonamide radicals through homolytic cleavage under EnT promotion. These radicals were then found to engage in an addition reaction with [1.1.1]propellane, generating bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) radicals that undergo subsequent C&#9472;H, C&#9472;X, C&#9472;S, or C&#9472;C coupling reactions to afford a variety of C3-substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanesulfonamides. This strategy featured mild conditions, operational simplicity, with high atomic utilization, and therefore not only offers an efficient synthesis of a range of C3-versatile-substituted BCP sulfonamides, but also significantly broadens the potential applicability of BCP-sulfonamides in drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Disorazole Z1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of disorazole Z1, a highly up to picomolar active cytotoxic natural product, is presented. An acyclic carbon chain containing a chiral quaternary carbon center surrounded by two chiral secondary alcohols was synthesized and combined with a functionalized diene&#8208;stannane to obtain the carbon skeleton of one half of disorazole Z1. Fitting two identical halves together resulted in the synthetic natural product.








Abstract
We wish to report the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1, a biologically extremely potent natural product (picomolar cytotoxicity) with complex molecular architecture featuring a 26&#8208;membered macrodiolide with lateral chains including a quaternary chiral carbon center. The complex acyclic lateral chains containing a stereochemical triad with the quaternary center surrounded by two hindered secondary alcohols were synthesized in a straightforward way by the use of two consecutive and highly diastereoselective aldol reactions with a lactone intermediate and further transformations to yield the desired (Z)&#8208;vinyl iodide. Successful esterification with a functionalized diene&#8208;stannane yielded the fully elaborated carbon skeleton. Making use of the C2 symmetry of the natural product, a double Stille coupling gave the protected natural product. Final deprotection provided (+)&#8208;disorazole Z1, which was fully identical to a natural sample.

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Competition between Photoswitching and Fluorescence in Hemiindigos and Hemithioindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsically fluorescent photoswitches (IFPSs) are crucial for super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. This study explores the impact of substituents on fluorescence and photoswitching efficiency in hemiindigos and hemithioindigos. A series of functionalized derivatives were synthesized by one&#8208;step Knoevenagel condensations using a sustainable mechanochemical approach and characterized across various environments. Ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted hemiindigo derivatives exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL = 0.65) while retaining significant photoswitching capabilities (&#934;Z&#8594;E = 0.29 in THF) and fast recovery. These enhanced properties are attributed to the p&#8208;electron&#8208;donating characteristics of the OH substituents and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The results of CC2 ab initio calculations revealed a detailed photoswitching mechanism: (1) initial population of the fluorescent pp* singlet excited state minimum, (2) subsequent elongation of the C=O bond leading to depopulation of the pp* state to the np* excited state minimum, (3) twisting of the double bond within the np* state, and (4) relaxation to the ground electronic state via a conical intersection. The analysis of the potential&#8208;energy surfaces modulated by EDG substittents, both in the in the pp* and np* excited states, provides insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of IFPSs, guiding future rational design.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Activity in Fluorinated Binolate Ytterbium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of novel CPL&#8208;active Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL) was designed and optically investigated, showing enhanced photophysical properties and CPL metrics compared to the nonfluorinated counterparts.








Abstract
Chiral lanthanide complexes hold great potential in developing advanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wavelength range. While various ligands, such as &#946;&#8208;diketonates and biphenols, have been successfully used to sensitize NIR emission of lanthanide ions, little attention has been paid to regulating CPL behaviors via ligand modification. In this study, we report the synthesis, structure, luminescence, and chiroptical properties of a pair of novel air&#8208;stable Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8242;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL). Compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts, these fluorinated complexes exhibit larger dihedral angles between the two naphthyl moieties and more distorted octahedral coordination environments around the Yb(III) ion, leading to increased overall crystal field splitting. These structural modifications result in enhanced photophysical properties: the luminescence lifetime (&#964;obs), sensitization efficiency (&#951;sens), and quantum yield (QY) improve from 2.1 &#181;s, 38%, and 0.7% to 2.7 &#181;s, 63%, and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the dissymmetry factor (glum) and CPL brightness (BCPL) at 963&#160;nm increase by 32% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The scope of such chemical modification is broad, potentially encompassing a variety of BINOL derivatives, offering a unique platform to further elucidate the relationship between structural and electronic properties and CPL activity in lanthanide systems.

         <title>Phosphor&#8208;Assisted TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescence (pTSF) OLEDs: Faster Excitons, Brighter Futures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphor&#8208;assisted TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) synergizes phosphorescent/thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to break spin&#8208;flip cycles in the TADF host, achieving near roll&#8208;off&#8208;free efficiency and enhanced stability at ultrahigh luminance via accelerated exciton dynamics. This review evaluates pTSF's potential for ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs (&gt;104&#160;cd m&#8722;2) through material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes.








Abstract
The impressive efficiency and lifetime under ultrahigh luminance remain a long&#8208;standing challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), as conventional fluorescent, phosphorescent, and thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) systems universally suffer from accelerated bimolecular annihilation at elevated exciton densities. Recently, phosphor&#8208;assisted TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (pTSF) has emerged as a groundbreaking architecture that synergistically integrates exciton utilization enhancement and radiative decay acceleration through breaking the singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;flip cycles in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) hosts via multiple sensitizations. The OLEDs based on pTSF achieve not only a nearly roll&#8208;off&#8208;free on external quantum efficiency but also a remarkable power efficiency, even when operating at ultrahigh luminance levels exceeding 100,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. In this review, we delve into the intricacies of pTSF technology, examining its material design principles, energy transfer dynamics, and exciton management processes. Eventually, we critically assess the challenges in implementing pTSF for blue&#8208;emitting OLEDs and propose strategic research directions to harness the full potential of this transformative technology.

         <title>Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulation of pH Effects on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Structure, Dynamics, and Metal&#8208;Binding</title>

         <dc:description>
Constant pH molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine the effect of pH on amyloid&#8208;&#946; and its complexes with Cu(II) and Zn(II). Changes in size and secondary structure are found, with suggestions for the origin of pH&#8208;dependent aggregation.








Abstract
We report the first molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of pH on the structure, dynamics, and metal&#8208;binding ability of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, the peptide implicated in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect the size, flexibility, and secondary structure of the peptide. The binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946;.

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry of Ditellurides</title>

Ditelluride exchange. Chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides undergo a rapid Te&#8208;Te exchange under mild reaction conditions in the absence of an external stimulus, indicating that ditellurides could find application in various dynamic molecular systems.








Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry enables the exploration of reversible chemical exchange reactions. Here, we report studies on the dynamic Te&#9472;Te bond exchange of chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides using 125Te NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi&#8208;component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te&#9472;Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperatures, in the absence of visible light, and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride&#8208;ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non&#8208;synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen&#8208;chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te&#8208;Te &gt; Te&#8208;Se &gt; Te&#8208;S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.

         <title>A Linear {FeIII2NiII} Cluster, a Structurally Closely Related Quasi 1D {FeIII2NiII} Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization, and magnetic properties of two closely related heterometallic {FeIII2NiII} species are reported, upon employment of suitable amino acid Schiff&#8208;base ligands; a discrete {FeIII2NiII} trimetallic cluster and a {FeIII2Ni&#921;&#921;}n chain. Despite their striking structural similarity, they display contrasting magnetic properties, with the former showing ferromagnetic and the latter antiferromagnetic behavior.








Abstract
The solvothermal reaction between FeCl3&#183;6H2O, NiCl2&#183;6H2O, 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthaldehyde, and glycine (gly) in MeOH results in the formation of the trinuclear heterometallic cluster [Fe&#921;&#921;&#921;2Ni&#921;&#921;(L1)4(MeOH)4] (1) in good yield, while the same reaction upon replacing gly with methyl&#8208;alanine (mAla), results in the formation of the closely related quasi 1D coordination polymer {[Fe&#921;&#921;&#921;2Ni&#921;&#921;(L2)4(MeOH)2]n} (2) (L1, L2: the dianionic form of the Schiff&#8208;base ligand derived from the condensation of 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthaldehyde and gly (L1 for 1), or mAla (L2 for 2)). The structure of 1 describes a linear trimetallic {FeIII2Ni} unit, whereas complex 2 consists of repeating linear {FeIII2Ni} units with each one connected to two neighboring units via four coordination bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;1D chain. The structural similarity between complex 1 and the repeating unit of complex 2 is remarkable. However, their magnetic properties differ significantly, with complex 1 displaying dominant ferromagnetic interactions, and complex 2 showing antiferromagnetic interactions.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Motion of Tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;Benzoquinone Within Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystals Through Variation of the Donor: An Entropic and Enthalpic Point of View</title>

         <dc:description>
Five CT cocrystals using TFBQ and fused, polycyclic donors derived from fluorene are synthesized. The &#960;&#8208;stacking in all cocrystals provides a platform for the displaying of in&#8208;plane molecular motions of TFBQ, which is by supramolecular interactions. This methodology provides a platform for the development and modulation of crystalline, organic materials with motion&#8208;mediated photophysical applications.








Abstract
In this work, we report a detailed investigation on the factors affecting the in&#8208;plane motion of tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFBQ) within a series of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals formed with various fused aromatic donors. Six crystalline materials were obtained, including four cocrystals, a polymorph, and a solid solution. These were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC XRD), solid&#8208;state NMR, FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. All cocrystals exhibited short &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and varied noncovalent interactions (NCI) modulating the in&#8208;plane motion of TFBQ. 19F T&#8321; relaxation measurements allowed the quantification of the activation enthalpies (&#916;H&#8225;) and entropies (&#916;S&#8225;), with theoretical calculations backing these results. Cocrystal 4 is the solid with the most restricted motions due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, cocrystal 3a depicts the highest in&#8208;plane motional frequencies (up to 2.2&#160;MHz at 300 K), owing to the weak contacts around TFBQ. Surprisingly, a solid solution (5), which resembled a mixture of cocrystals 2 and 3a, displayed no significant in&#8208;plane motions, despite having similar packing and relaxation behavior to the binary cocrystals. This work illustrates how subtle variations in donor structure affect the in&#8208;plane motions and photophysical properties of CT cocrystals, providing valuable insight into the rational design of functional materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report a detailed investigation on the factors affecting the in-plane motion of tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone (TFBQ) within a series of charge-transfer (CT) cocrystals formed with various fused aromatic donors. Six crystalline materials were obtained, including four cocrystals, a polymorph, and a solid solution. These were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC XRD), solid-state NMR, FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. All cocrystals exhibited short &#960;-stacking interactions and varied noncovalent interactions (NCI) modulating the in-plane motion of TFBQ. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&#8321; relaxation measurements allowed the quantification of the activation enthalpies (&lt;i&gt;&#916;H&lt;sup&gt;&#8225;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and entropies (&lt;i&gt;&#916;S&lt;sup&gt;&#8225;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;), with theoretical calculations backing these results. Cocrystal &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is the solid with the most restricted motions due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, cocrystal &lt;b&gt;3a&lt;/b&gt; depicts the highest in-plane motional frequencies (up to 2.2&#160;MHz at 300 K), owing to the weak contacts around TFBQ. Surprisingly, a solid solution (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), which resembled a mixture of cocrystals &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3a&lt;/b&gt;, displayed no significant in-plane motions, despite having similar packing and relaxation behavior to the binary cocrystals. This work illustrates how subtle variations in donor structure affect the in-plane motions and photophysical properties of CT cocrystals, providing valuable insight into the rational design of functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Mediated Charge&#8208;Transfer Assemblies Composed of Resorcin[4]Arene and Viologen Salts</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel CT assemblies consisted of a concaved aromatic host and electron&#8208;deficient organic salts are reported. The CT transition is promoted by concerted weak interactions between the components. The excited state dynamics are revealed by a theoretical study and a time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy.








Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies of a concaved aromatic host as an electron donor (D) and a cationic heterocyclic guest as an electron acceptor (A) are reported. These molecular units were noncovalently bound to afford charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes in solution and a CT cocrystal, displaying drastic color change from colorless to orange. The binding motif of the assemblies in the solution state was analyzed by NMR spectroscopic analysis and visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations for the assemblies revealed electronic communication between the D and A fragments, proving their CT characteristics. The CT complexes were stabilized by not only CT and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, but also Coulomb interaction between the cationic acceptor unit and its anion supported by a hydrogen bond with a hydroxy group in the aromatic host, resulted in enhancement of orbital overlapping of the D&#8208;A fragments. Owing to the strong D&#8208;A interaction in the assemblies, the CT complexes undergo ultrafast charge recombination on a femtosecond timescale after photoexcitation of the CT transition, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that understanding of assembly motif and its noncovalent interactions can lead to create optical materials manipulating electron transition dynamics.

         <title>Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nb2C Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic ORR to Selectively Produce H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) obtained via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method are presented here. The doping of N via ammonia etching results in pore structures and also effectively modulates the electronic structure, therefore leading to a larger specific surface area and more active sites of N&#8208;Nb2C. Significant improvements in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction catalytic performance have been achieved, resulting in a H2O2 yield of 86.8%.








Abstract
The two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Among various types of potential catalysts, MXene have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding electrical conductivity, abundant edge active sites, and low costs. In this study, we successfully synthesize porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method and investigate their ORR performance toward the formation of H2O2. The doping of nitrogen effectively modulates the electronic structure of Nb2C nanosheets, while the abundant surface pores formed during ammonia etching facilitate the ORR process. Hence, the electrocatalytic performance of N&#8208;Nb2C nanosheets is significantly improved, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability. Notably, in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) tests, the N&#8208;Nb2C catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 86.8%, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production through electrocatalytic ORR. Our findings suggest that N&#8208;doped Nb2C holds great promise for applications in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Oligomeric Protein Complexes formed by&#160;Beta Amyloid Peptides and Their Molecular Associates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation and dysregulation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate A&#946; peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2+) and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of A&#946; peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize A&#946; peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting &#946;&#8208;sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid&#8208;state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2+ induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of A&#946; oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP&#8208;43 variant can form stable protein complex with A&#946;40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site&#8208;specific 13C chemical shifts of the A&#946;40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2+, A&#946;42, and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, revealed that A&#946;40 predominantly adopts a &#946;1&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the &#946;1 region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the &#946;&#8208;sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Ferrous Iron in a True Square&#8208;Planar Molecular Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the substituted iron phthalocyanine, FePcOAr, exhibiting a true square&#8208;planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents, allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S = 1 ground state with large positive, axial zero&#8208;field splitting and a strongly anisotropic g&#8208;tensor, with two g&#8208;values much larger than the free electron g&#8208;value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin&#8208;orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of phthalocyanines and the long standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;Containing Double Helicenes Featuring Robust Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces two S&#8208;containing double helicenes capable of forming robust radical cations. These compounds were synthesized via the Scholl reaction, which was modulated to an intermediate stage by reducing the amount of oxidant, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;containing [7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis reveals that both S&#8208;containing double helicenes exhibit twisted conformations consistent with the global minima identified through DFT calculations. Upon chemical oxidation with nitrosonium, these double helicenes produced &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations, whose radical nature was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These radical cations remained stable in solution when exposed to air for several weeks, as monitored by absorption spectroscopy. One of the double helicenes forms &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the crystals of both neutral molecule and radical cation salt. The radical cation hexafluoroantimonate salt exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of up to 0.16 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions observed in its crystal structure. This study indicates the potential of double helical &#960;&#8208;skeletons as a versatile platform for developing resilient &#960;&#8208;conjugated radical cations without compromising &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with potential applications in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &gt;99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatic Bromination toward Biocompatible Tyrosine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical modification of biomolecules is an emerging technique for studying and manipulating biological mechanisms. Among these methodologies, catalysis offers advantages over stoichiometric strategies due to its ability to enhance selectivity, e.g., spatiotemporal control, via catalytic turnover, and the modification of tyrosine recently attracts considerable attention due to its significant biological functions. However, catalyst&#8208;controlled aromatic halogenation is challenging under near&#8208;physiological conditions due to the lack of biocompatible catalysts, despite the potential of tyrosine bromination as an attractive biomolecular labeling technique. In this study, inspired by the bioorthogonal reactivity of cyclic olefins, we developed catalytic aromatic bromination via the transfer of a bromenium ion from olefins to aromatic substrates based on the in&#8208;situ generation of bromiranium ions as active species. Bifunctional cyclooctenes bearing a hydroxybenzyl group efficiently catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification. The substituent effects of the catalysts primarily affected the rate of the generation of bromiranium ions, which provided the kinetics enabling light&#8208;gated catalysis that could be activated in situ via the photochemical deprotection of the hydroxybenzyl group. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.</dc:description>

In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

This complex expands the known scope of tris(guanidinate)M(III) complexes to include Mo, and adds to the very limited knowledge of homoleptic mononuclear Mo(III) coordination complexes. Volatility of Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 is demonstrated via thermogravimetric analysis, hinting to potential applications as a molecular precursor for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Proof of concept aerosol&#8208;assisted CVD growth with Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 as a single source precursor yielded MoCxNy films.

         <title>Investigation of the Degree of Functionalization and Colloidal Stability of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Functionalized TiO2 Nanoparticles as a Function of Different Phosphonic Acid Chain Lengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a series of&#160;Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell&#160;(SbS)&#8208;functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6 nm TiO2&#160;anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2&#8208;PACX@SDBS (X = 3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first&#8208;shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chain.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, a series of&#160;Shell-by-Shell&#160;(SbS)-functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6 nm TiO2&#160;anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2-PACX@SDBS (X = 3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first-shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Protein Photo&#8208;Stability Analysis Using SRCD in the Presence of Phospholipid SUVs.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts on a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and ageing. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerisation is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. Aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. To this end, the UV&#8208;denaturation experiment developed at the B23 beamline of the Diamond Light Source (UK) is employed, which high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beamlight induce protein denaturation when repeated consecutive synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra are acquired in the far&#8208;UV region, diagnostic of protein folding. This allows the estimation of protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV&#8208;denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible photocyclization of imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene derivative apparently over non&#8208;triene form</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen&#8208;based diarylethenes have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C=C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C&#8208;N framework along with C=C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C=N form as a minor mesomeric bipolar form. Crystal structural analysis supported major contribution of the former from. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E&#8211;Z photoisomerization but also the 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclization with photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 for cyclization reaction. These values are comparable to the usual diarylethenes. The symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical diarylethenes and satisfied the Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in diarylethenes, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the 6&#960;&#8208;photocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl Shift Rearrangement in Scholl&#8208;type Reaction toward Nanographene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory. Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation&#8208; and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands have been synthesized and characterized which show excellent catalytic activity towards &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly non&#8208;bifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208;sphere and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Non&#8208;Activated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide &#8208; Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply &#160;Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of non&#8208;activated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com&#173;plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti&#8208;selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the "matched" enantiomer of the chiral "Berkessel salalen ligand" is employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq = semiquinone; cat = catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8208;/cat2&#8208; couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.</dc:description>

The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6-methyl-2-pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one-electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox-coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand-centered and involve the three sq&#8226;-/cat2- couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic Interrogation of Thiolate Hydrogen Bonding in the CO Sensor Protein CooA: Implications for Thiolate Ligation Stability and Cytochrome P450 Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine (Cys) thiolate coordination is a unique ligation motif found in heme enzymes and small molecule sensors. Divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. We report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H&#8208;bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide&#8208;sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H&#8208;bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H&#8208;bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H&#8208;bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119 to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. We show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate&#8208;Fe bond than the pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H&#8208;bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results suggest thiolate H&#8208;bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of the Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent JanthE for the Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde&#8208;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large&#8208;scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2&#8208;oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy&#8208;2&#8208;propanone to the product 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenoxypentan&#8208;3&#8208;one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single&#8208;point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (&gt;90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2&#8208;oxopentanoate, the double variant K567S_Y297P showed a 5&#8208;fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Double Perovskites Doped with Sb3+/Er3+ as Stable and Effective Luminescence Materials in the Vis&#8208;NIR Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The luminescence properties of stable halide double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI &#8211; 40% Ag, 60% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ in the region 250&#8208;1600 nm were investigated for the first time and reveal significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and TOF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman Spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3+ ions emit blue light at 450 nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3+ ions. Notably, the Er3+ emit radiation at 1540 nm, a wavelength particularly advantageous for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525 nm, 552 nm, 665 nm and 805 nm are observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3+ ions. These compelling results have been supported by calculations based on Modified Crystal Field Theory, elucidating the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3+ and Er3+ on the crystal structure and luminescent properties. Leveraging the synthesized materials, we successfully have developed a LED prototype that utilizes a UV chip &#160;combined with the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.9Er0.01Sb0.09Cl6 powder as a stable and effective luminophore for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase inhibitor that has antituberculosis and herbicidal activity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione,&#160;1f&#160;is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;(Mt) KARI (Ki&#160;= 23.3 nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the&#160;MtKARI homolog from&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;(Sa),&#160;SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for&#160;Oryza sativa&#160;KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by&#160;1f&#160;is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146 nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties,&#160;1f&#160;has an MIC of 12.7 &#181;M for&#160;MtH37Rv and inhibits&#160;Brassica campestris&#160;growth by 63% at 10 mg/mL. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the polar conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light&#8208;blue over 720 h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the polar environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Push and Pull: The Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electrocnic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the LUMO, shifts the reduction potential by +0.9 V and completely quenches emission via non&#8208;radiative deactivation processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776;25 nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, non&#8208;emissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (25.9 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural and electronic modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and reactivity of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next&#8208;generation photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation using bidentate phosphines: How the stereochemistry of the ligand affects the catalyst's activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order is confirmed by the computed apparent Gibbs free energy barrier (57.7, 79.7, and 91.4 kJ mol&#8208;1, respectively). The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to its higher stability compared to the hydride complex and lower stability compared to the CO complex, in contrast to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies towards synthesis and conversion of lignin model compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The push towards a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature and what the product streams identified are. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetically arrested SERS&#8208;Active aggregates for biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. Biofluids present challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tuneable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Controlled aggregation of AuNPs has been achieved by incorporating a &#8216;molecular&#8208;glue&#8217;, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), to produce AuNP:CB[7] aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1 nm) and displaying strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations, but eventually leads to irreversible precipitation. Here we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates. The aggregates maintain SERS&#8208;activity, are highly tuneable through facile modification of the PEG chain length and grafting density, and possess improved stability. Moreover, the AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates demonstrate low concentration detection of a common Raman reporter alongside a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexities and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt&#8208;Ag cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes. This study proves that the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in the molecular system, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trifluorophenyldiazonium &#8211; a unique radical source for the visible light induced, catalyst&#8208;free arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct radical arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides has been achieved under highly attractive conditions, requiring only the peptide substrate, a 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salt and irradiation with visible light. Being well&#8208;balanced in its reactivity to form strong charge transfer complexes with the phenolic side chain, which are required for initiation and aryl radical formation, the trifluoro substitution still shows sufficient stability towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution in aqueous solution. Besides allowing selective arylation, the introduction of the 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl unit enables further functionalization as well as potential applications in NMR and MRT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
