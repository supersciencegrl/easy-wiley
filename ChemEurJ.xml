         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of Boronium Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronium cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) have demonstrated high thermal stability and a &gt;5.8 V electrochemical stability window. Additionally, IL&#8208;based electrolytes containing the salt LiTFSI have shown stable cycling against the Li metal anode, the &#8220;Holy grail&#8221; of rechargeable lithium batteries. However, the basic spectroscopic characterisation needed for further development and effective application is missing for these promising ILs and electrolytes. In this work, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used in combination to characterise four ILs and electrolytes based on the [NNBH2]+  and [(TMEDA)BH2] &#160;boronium cations and the [FSI]&#8211;  and [TFSI]&#8211;  anions. Using this combined experimental and computational approach, proper understanding of the role of different ion&#8208;ion interactions for the Li cation coordination environment in the electrolytes was achieved. Furthermore, the calculated vibrational frequencies assisted in the proper mode assignments for the ILs and in providing insights into the spectroscopic features expected at the interface created when they are adsorbed on a Li(001) surface. A reproducible synthesis procedure for [(TMEDA)BH2]+  is also reported. The fundamental findings presented in this work are beneficial for any future studies that utilise IL based electrolytes in next generation Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as Nano&#8208;Octopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10448-10455, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbazolic derivatives are reported to associate with fullerenes as a novel host class. Different amounts of carbazole units and tunable bridged linker modulated the binding strength and its alternated arrangement pattern. Benefit from the continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 short&#8208;contact channels, promising electron&#8208;transport and photovoltaic effects are achieved in the host&#8208;guest complex devices.







Abstract
Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, three novel carbazolic derivatives, containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes, are rationally designed. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when a continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 interaction channel existed. The results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Effect of Fluorine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Site Catalyst in the Ethylene Dimerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10413-10421, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive and detailed computational study of the ethylene dimerization reaction mechanism on the inorganic building unit on Pd&#8208;single site MOF heterogeneous catalysts was carried out. The origins of the catalytic performance of bis&#8208;triazolate ligand with biphenyl organic backbone and its fluorinated counterpart were elucidated. This represents the first example of using computational analysis to uncover the palladium&#8208;MOF catalyst&#8242;s reactivity and the ligand fluorine effect for ethylene dimerization reaction.







Abstract
Ethylene dimerization reaction is one of the most common mechanisms for the production of 1&#8208;butene. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received extensive attention in this area since they combine all the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in a single compound. Here a computational mechanistic study of MOF&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;site catalyst for ethylene dimerization reaction is reported. Catalytic systems with both biphenyl&#8208;type backbone as organic ligand and its fluorine&#8208;functionalization have been investigated to reveal the origin of ligand effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculations revealed that the nonfluorinated palladium MOF catalyst undergoes dimerization over isomerization reaction. Then the influence of the fluorine&#8208;functionalized organic ligand was compared in the dimerization catalytic cycle, which was strongly favored in terms of activity and selectivity. Catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions were analyzed by energy decomposition analysis revealing the critical role of ligand backbone functionalization on the activity. This theoretical analysis identified three chemically meaningful dominant effects on these catalysts; steric, electrostatic and charge transfer effects. The steric effects promote nonfluorinated MOF catalyst, whereas the electrostatic effects are the dominant factor that promotes its fluorinated counterpart. This theoretical study provides feedback with future experimental studies about the role of fluorine ligand functionalization in palladium MOF catalysts for ethylene dimerization reaction.

Getting at the Hyp of amanitin: A formal study of structure&#8208;function relationships for trans&#8208;hydroxyproline &#8211; a key functionality the specifies the toxicity of amanitin is undertaken to probe aspects of H&#8208;bonding and other interactions with analogs of hydroxyl&#8208;proline. The toxin is surprisingly refractory to replacing the hydroxyproline.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;amanitin, an extremely toxic bicyclic octapeptide extracted from the death&#8208;cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is a highly selective allosteric inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Following on growing interest in using this toxin as a payload in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, herein we report the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of several new derivatives of this toxin to probe the role of the trans&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp), which is known to be critical for toxicity. This structure activity relationship (SAR) study represents the first of its kind to use various Hyp&#8208;analogs to alter the conformational and H&#8208;bonding properties of Hyp in amanitin.

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and Its Two&#8208;Sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10293-10302, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (Cubbi LC) phase of Ia3d gyroid&#8208;type given by a nonsymmetric core molecule exhibits a two&#8208;sided nature by showing two core assembly modes specific to symmetric molecules with large cores or small cores, depending on temperature and thermal cycle. As another effect of the core nonsymmetry, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100&#8197;days with slight distortion.







Abstract
A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for the possibility of new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. In this work, a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is shown to be the first example of molecule forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the Ia3d phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350&#8197;K), a metastable Ia3d phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100&#8197;days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bicontinuous cubic&lt;/b&gt; liquid crystalline (Cub&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt; LC) phase of &lt;i&gt;Ia&lt;/i&gt;3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; gyroid-type given by a nonsymmetric core molecule exhibits a two-sided nature by showing two core assembly modes specific to symmetric molecules with large cores or small cores, depending on temperature and thermal cycle. As another effect of the core nonsymmetry, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100&#8197;days with slight distortion.

Dancing partners: &#8220;Snapshot&#8221; trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums in a halogen dance has been realized in a batch reactor. This method allows selective generation of isomeric azolylzinc species from a single starting material by using newly synthesized bench&#8208;stable zinc halide diamine complexes, leading to the divergent and stereoselective synthesis of functionalized azoles.







Abstract
Recent developments in flow microreactor technology have allowed the use of transient organolithium compounds that cannot be realized in a batch reactor. However, trapping the transient aryllithiums in a &#8220;halogen dance&#8221; is still challenging. Herein is reported the trapping of such short&#8208;lived azolyllithiums in a batch reactor by developing a finely tuned in&#8197;situ zincation using zinc halide diamine complexes. The reaction rate is controlled by the appropriate choice of diamine ligand. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0&#8201;&#176;C with high reproducibility on a multigram scale. This method was applicable to a wide range of brominated azoles allowing deprotonative functionalization, which was used for the concise divergent syntheses of both constitutional isomers of biologically active azoles.

         <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;Dimethylallene with N&#8208;Methylaniline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10377-10386, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses of the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;dimethylallene with N&#8208;methylaniline support a mechanism involving rapid and reversible addition of N&#8208;methylaniline to the more substituted terminus of gold &#960;&#8208;allene complex I to form gold vinyl complex II superimposed on slower addition of N&#8208;methylaniline to the less substituted terminus of I to form gold vinyl complex III. Selective formation of the linear allylic amine 3&#8201;a is attributed to the more facile protodeauration of III relative to II.







Abstract
The mechanism of the intermolecular hydroamination of 3&#8208;methylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene (1) with N&#8208;methylaniline (2) catalyzed by (IPr)AuOTf has been studied by employing a combination of kinetic analysis, deuterium labelling studies, and in&#8197;situ spectral analysis of catalytically active mixtures. The results of these and additional experiments are consistent with a mechanism for hydroamination involving reversible, endergonic displacement of N&#8208;methylaniline from [(IPr)Au(NHMePh)]+ (4) by allene to form the cationic gold &#960;&#8208;C1,C2&#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;2&#8208;H2C=C=CMe2)]+ (I), which is in rapid, endergonic equilibrium with the regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;C2,C3&#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;2&#8208;Me2C=C=CH2)]+ (I&#8242;). Rapid and reversible outer&#8208;sphere addition of 2 to the terminal allene carbon atom of I&#8242; to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CH2)CMe2NMePh] (II) is superimposed on the slower addition of 2 to the terminal allene carbon atom of I to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CMe2)CH2NMePh] (III). Selective protodeauration of III releases N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)aniline (3&#8201;a) with regeneration of 4. At high conversion, gold vinyl complex II is competitively trapped by an (IPr)Au+ fragment to form the cationic bis(gold) vinyl complex {[(IPr)Au]2[C(=CH2)CMe2NMePh]}+ (6).

         <title>Managing Experimental 3D Structures in the Beyond&#8208;Rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 Chemical Space: The Case of Rifampicin</title>

The bRo5 space includes large and flexible drug candidates which may assume different privileged conformations and exhibit chameleonic properties. We characterized the conformational ensembles of rifampicin in polar and nonpolar solvents and in the solid state. We performed NMR experiments, analyzed CSD structures and calculated a polarity descriptor. Results show that rifampicin is not a chameleon and its conformational behavior in solution and in the solid state is not superposable.







Abstract
The beyond&#8208;Rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 (bRo5) chemical space is a source of new oral drugs and includes large and flexible compounds. Because of their size and conformational variability, bRo5 molecules assume different privileged conformations in the compartments of human body, i.&#8201;e., they can exhibit chameleonic properties. The elucidation of the ensemble of 3D structures explored by such molecules under different conditions is therefore critical to check the role played by chameleonicity to modulate cell permeability. Here we characterized the conformational ensembles of rifampicin, a bRo5 drug, in polar and nonpolar solvents and in the solid state. We performed NMR experiments, analyzed their results with a novel algorithm and set&#8208;up a pool of ad hoc in silico strategies to investigate crystallographic structures retrieved from the CSD. Moreover, a polarity descriptor often related to permeability (SA&#8208;3D&#8208;PSA) was calculated for all the conformers and its variation with the environment analyzed. Results showed that the conformational behavior of rifampicin in solution and in the solid state is not superposable. The identification of dynamic intramolecular hydrogen bonds can be assessed by NMR spectroscopy but not by X&#8208;ray structures. Moreover, SA&#8208;3D&#8208;PSA revealed that dynamic IMHBs do not provide rifampicin with chameleonic properties. Overall, this study highlights that the peculiarity of rifampicin, which is cell permeable probably because of the presence of static IMHBs but is devoid of any chameleonic behavior, can be assessed by a proper analysis of experimental 3D structures.

         <title>Bis(pertrifluoromethylcatecholato)silane: Extreme Lewis Acidity Broadens the Catalytic Portfolio of Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10422-10427, July 16, 2021. </description>

The extremely electron&#8208;deficient tetratrifluorocatechol is synthesized and installed at silicon, providing a Lewis superacid that ranks among the strongest fluoride ion acceptors accessible in the condensed phase. The compound enables silicon&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of ketones, aldehydes, amides and phosphine oxides and the first silicon catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis.







Abstract
Given its earth abundance, silicon is ideal for constructing Lewis acids of use in catalysis or materials science. Neutral silanes were limited to moderate Lewis acidity, until halogenated catecholato ligands provoked a significant boost. However, catalytic applications of bis(perhalocatecholato)silanes were suffering from very poor solubility and unknown deactivation pathways. In this work, the novel per(trifluoromethyl)catechol, H2catCF3, and adducts of its silicon complex Si(catCF3)2 (1) are described. According to the computed fluoride ion affinity, 1 ranks among the strongest neutral Lewis acids currently accessible in the condensed phase. The improved robustness and affinity of 1 enable deoxygenations of aldehydes, ketones, amides, or phosphine oxides, and a carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. All those transformations have never been catalyzed by a neutral silane. Attempts to obtain donor&#8208;free 1 attest to the extreme Lewis acidity by stabilizing adducts with even the weakest donors, such as benzophenone or hexaethyl disiloxane.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Disaccharides in Water: Preorganized Macrocyclic or Adaptive Acyclic?</title>

Adaptive to be selective: Comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related biomimetic receptors toward disaccharides sheds light on the differences between a rigid macrocyclic architecture and a flexible tweezer&#8208;shaped structure showing, counterintuitively, that the adaptive structure can be advantageous in terms of selectivity. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling calculations were used to provide a 3D description of the receptor&#8208;disaccharide complexes in solution and explaining the origin of the observed selectivity.







Abstract
When facing the dilemma of following a preorganized or adaptive design approach in conceiving the architecture of new biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic structures were most often chosen to achieve effective recognition of neutral saccharides in water. In contrast, acyclic architectures have seldom been explored, even though potentially simpler and more easily accessible. In this work, comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related diaminocarbazolic receptors, featuring a macrocyclic and an acyclic tweezer&#8208;shaped architecture, highlighted the advantages provided by the acyclic receptor in terms of selectivity in the recognition of 1,4&#8208;disaccharides of biological interest. Selective recognition of GlcNAc2, the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, stands as an emblematic example. NMR spectroscopic data and molecular modeling calculations were used to ascertain the differences in binding mode and to shed light on the origin of recognition efficacy and selectivity.

A dynamic covalent Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction is demonstrated and applied to the generation of dynamic catalyst systems. The systems exhibited triggered self&#8208;resolution, preferentially amplifying a specific catalyst/product set out of a many potential alternatives, as well as systemic thermodynamically driven error&#8208;correction.







Abstract
Understanding the emergence of function in complex reaction networks is a primary goal of systems chemistry and origin&#8208;of&#8208;life studies. Especially challenging is to create systems that simultaneously exhibit several emergent functions that can be independently tuned. In this work, a multifunctional complex reaction network of nucleophilic small molecule catalysts for the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction is demonstrated. The dynamic system exhibited triggered self&#8208;resolution, preferentially amplifying a specific catalyst/product set out of a many potential alternatives. By utilizing selective reversibility of the products of the reaction set, systemic thermodynamically driven error&#8208;correction could also be introduced. To achieve this, a dynamic covalent MBH reaction based on adducts with internal H&#8208;transfer capabilities was developed. By careful tuning of the substituents, rate accelerations of retro&#8208;MBH reactions of up to four orders of magnitude could be obtained. This study thus demonstrates how efficient self&#8208;sorting of catalytic systems can be achieved through an interplay of several complex emergent functionalities.

         <title>Relevance of &#960;&#8208;Backbonding for the Reactivity of Electrophilic Anions [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN)</title>

         <dc:description>
A new type of &#960;&#8208;backbonding is discussed, which was observed between the &#960;&#8208;acceptors CO/N2 and the closo&#8208;dodecaborate fragments [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN). The highly reactive [B12X11]&#8722; anions transfer electron density from their delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems into antibonding orbitals of the respective acceptor molecules. Moreover, the comprehensive set of data provided with this study gives insights into the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8722; anions depending on the substituent X.







Abstract
Electrophilic anions of type [B12X11]&#8722; posses a vacant positive boron binding site within the anion. In a comparatitve experimental and theoretical study, the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8722; with X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN is characterized towards different nucleophiles: (i) noble gases (NGs) as &#963;&#8208;donors and (ii) CO/N2 as &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptors. Temperature&#8208;dependent formation of [B12X11NG]&#8722; indicates the enthalpy order (X=CN)&gt;(X=Cl)&#8776;(X=Br)&gt;(X=I)&#8776;(X=F) almost independent of the NG in good agreement with calculated trends. The observed order is explained by an interplay of the electron deficiency of the vacant boron site in [B12X11]&#8722; and steric effects. The binding of CO and N2 to [B12X11]&#8722; is significantly stronger. The B3LYP 0&#8197;K attachment enthapies follow the order (X=F)&gt;(X=CN)&gt;(X=Cl)&gt;(X=Br)&gt;(X=I), in contrast to the NG series. The bonding motifs of [B12X11CO]&#8722; and [B12X11N2]&#8722; were characterized using cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy by focusing on the CO and N2 stretching frequencies 
 and 
, respectively. Observed shifts of 
 and 
 are explained by an interplay between electrostatic effects (blue shift), due to the positive partial charge, and by &#960;&#8208;backdonation (red shift). Energy decomposition analysis and analysis of natural orbitals for chemical valence support all conclusions based on the experimental results. This establishes a rational understanding of [B12X11]&#8722; reactivety dependent on the substituent X and provides first systematic data on &#960;&#8208;backdonation from delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems of closo&#8208;borate anions.

         <title>Expanding the Topological Landscape by a G&#8208;Column Flip of a Parallel G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>

Starting with a parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G&#8208;quadruplex, refolding into a novel (3+1) hybrid topology with a propeller&#8208;propeller&#8208;lateral loop architecture and an all&#8208;syn 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal G&#8208;tract is reported. Although supported by additional stacking of a lateral duplex hairpin onto an outer G&#8208;tetrad, the structural rearrangement must be enforced through the specific incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring 8&#8208;bromoguanosine analogues into the terminal G&#8208;run.







Abstract
Canonical G&#8208;quadruplexes can adopt a variety of different topologies depending on the arrangement of propeller, lateral, or diagonal loops connecting the four G&#8208;columns. A novel intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex structure is derived through inversion of the last G&#8208;tract of a three&#8208;layered parallel fold, associated with the transition of a single propeller into a lateral loop. The resulting (3+1) hybrid fold features three syn&#8901;anti&#8901;anti&#8901;anti G&#8208;tetrads with a 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal all&#8208;syn G&#8208;column. Although the ability of forming a duplex stem&#8208;loop between G&#8208;tracts seems beneficial for a propeller&#8208;to&#8208;lateral loop rearrangement, unmodified G&#8208;rich sequences resist folding into the new (3+1) topology. However, refolding can be driven by the incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring guanosine analogues into positions of the fourth G&#8208;stretch. The presented hybrid&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure as determined by NMR spectroscopy may provide for an additional scaffold in quadruplex&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>A CeCoOx Core/Nb2O5@TiO2 Double&#8208;Shell Nanocage Catalyst Demonstrates High Activity and Water Resistance for Catalytic Combustion of o&#8208;Dichlorobenzene</title>

Putting another coat on: CeCoOx catalysts with different core&#8208;shell compositions and structures have been prepared for o&#8208;DCB catalytic combustion. Coating the catalysts with Nb2O5 could greatly improve their activity. Moreover, TiO2 protected the Ce from inactivation by Cl deposition. This gave them good thermal and hydrothermal stabilities in addition to their catalytic activity.







Abstract
A series of catalysts with different core&#8208;shell structures has been successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method. They consisted of CeCoOx@TiO2 (single shell), CeCoOx@Nb2O5 (single shell) and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 (double shell) core&#8208;shell nanocages and CeCoOx nanocages, in which CeCoOx was the core and TiO2 and Nb2O5 were shells. The influence of the core&#8208;shell structure on the catalytic performance of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene was investigated by activity, water&#8208;resistance, and thermal stability tests as well as catalyst characterization. The temperatures corresponding to 90&#8201;% conversion of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (T90) of CeCoOx, CeCoOx@TiO2, CeCoOx@Nb2O5, and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts were 415, 383, 362 and 367&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. CeCoOx@Nb2O5 exhibited excellent catalytic activity, mainly owing to the special core&#8208;shell structure, large specific surface area, abundant activity of Co3+, Ce3+, Nb5+, strong reducibility, and more active oxygen vacancies. It can be seen that the Nb2O5 coating can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In addition, due to the protective effect of the TiO2 shell on CeCoOx, CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts exhibited outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability for 20&#8197;hours. The T90 of CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 was slightly lower than that of CeCoOx@Nb2O5, but it had higher stability and hydrothermal stability. Furthermore, possible reaction pathways involving the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (MvK) and Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) models were deduced based on studies of the temperature&#8208;programmed desorption of O2 (O2&#8208;TPD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization.

         <title>Upper Critical Solution Temperature&#8208;Type Responsive Cyclodextrins with Characteristic Inclusion Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10470-10476, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins (CDs) carrying ureido moieties in their peripheries were demonstrated to show unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in water, as well as strong inclusion toward guest dyes either below or above their phase transition temperatures. The coacervates of these CD derivatives further co&#8208;encapsulated a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched on and off through the phase transitions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble and thermoresponsive macrocycles with stable inclusion toward guests are highly valuable to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials for versatile applications. Here, we develop such macrocycles &#8211; ureido&#8208;substituted cyclodextrins (CDs) which exhibit unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in aqueous media. These novel CD derivatives showed good solubility in water at elevated temperature, but collapsed from water to form large coacervates upon cooling to low temperature. Their cloud points are greatly dependent on concentration and can be mediated through oxidation and chelation with silver ions. Significantly, the amphiphilicity of these CD derivatives is supportive to host&#8208;guest binding, which affords them inclusion abilities to guest dyes. The inclusion complexation remained nearly intact during thermally induced phase transitions, which is in contrast to the switchable inclusion behavior of lower critical solution temperature (LCST)&#8208;type CDs. Moreover, ureido&#8208;substituted CDs were exploited to co&#8208;encapsulate a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched by the UCST phase transition. We therefore believe these novel thermoresponsive CDs may form a new strategy for developing smart macrocycles and allow for exploring smart supramolecular materials.

         <title>Broad Scope and High&#8208;Yield Access to Unsymmetrical Acyclic [11C]Ureas for Biomedical Imaging from [11C]Carbonyl Difluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10369-10376, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [11C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines are described. This new methodology is compatible with a range of functional groups and with both aliphatic amines and anilines.







Abstract
Effective methods are needed for labelling acyclic ureas with carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2=20.4&#8197;min) as potential radiotracers for biomedical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we describe the rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [11C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines. This methodology is compatible with diverse functionality (e.&#8201;g., hydroxy, carboxyl, amino, amido, or pyridyl) in the substrate amines. The labelling process proceeds through putative [11C]carbamoyl fluorides and for primary amines through isolable [11C]isocyanate intermediates. Unsymmetrical [11C]ureas are produced with negligible amounts of unwanted symmetrical [11C]urea byproducts. Moreover, the overall labelling method tolerates trace water and the generally moderate to excellent yields show good reproducibility. [11C]Carbonyl difluoride shows exceptional promise for application to the synthesis of acyclic [11C]ureas as new radiotracers for biomedical imaging with PET.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The rapid and high-yield&lt;/b&gt; syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no-carrier-added [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines are described. This new methodology is compatible with a range of functional groups and with both aliphatic amines and anilines.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective methods are needed for labelling acyclic ureas with carbon-11 (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=20.4&#8197;min) as potential radiotracers for biomedical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we describe the rapid and high-yield syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no-carrier-added [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines. This methodology is compatible with diverse functionality (e.&#8201;g., hydroxy, carboxyl, amino, amido, or pyridyl) in the substrate amines. The labelling process proceeds through putative [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carbamoyl fluorides and for primary amines through isolable [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]isocyanate intermediates. Unsymmetrical [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ureas are produced with negligible amounts of unwanted symmetrical [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]urea byproducts. Moreover, the overall labelling method tolerates trace water and the generally moderate to excellent yields show good reproducibility. [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]Carbonyl difluoride shows exceptional promise for application to the synthesis of acyclic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ureas as new radiotracers for biomedical imaging with PET.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>(Automated) Synthesis of Well&#8208;defined Staphylococcus Aureus Wall Teichoic Acid Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10461-10469, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using tailor&#8208;made teichoic acid building blocks, a library of glycosylated ribitol phosphate Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic acids (WTA) has been assembled, ranging in length, and varying in N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine substitution pattern. The library of well&#8208;defined WTAs has been used to develop a magnetic bead binding assay to interrogate monoclonal antibody binding, revealing the preference of the various antibodies for different glycosylation patterns.







Abstract
Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important components of the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. WTAs are composed of repeating ribitol phosphate (RboP) residues that are decorated with d&#8208;alanine and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, in a seemingly random manner. These WTA&#8208;modifications play an important role in shaping the interactions of WTA with the host immune system. Due to the structural heterogeneity of WTAs, it is impossible to isolate pure and well&#8208;defined WTA molecules from bacterial sources. Therefore, here synthetic chemistry to assemble a broad library of WTA&#8208;fragments, incorporating all possible glycosylation modifications (&#945;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C3) described for S. aureus WTAs, is reported. DNA&#8208;type chemistry, employing ribitol phosphoramidite building blocks, protected with a dimethoxy trityl group, was used to efficiently generate a library of WTA&#8208;hexamers. Automated solid phase syntheses were used to assemble a WTA&#8208;dodecamer and glycosylated WTA&#8208;hexamer. The synthetic fragments have been fully characterized and diagnostic signals were identified to discriminate the different glycosylation patterns. The different glycosylated WTA&#8208;fragments were used to probe binding of monoclonal antibodies using WTA&#8208;functionalized magnetic beads, revealing the binding specificity of these WTA&#8208;specific antibodies and the importance of the specific location of the GlcNAc modifications on the WTA&#8208;chains.

         <title>Prediction and Validation of a Druggable Site on Virulence Factor of Drug Resistant Burkholderia cenocepacia**
</title>

A new druggable site for anti&#8208;adhesive therapy. We used fragment&#8208;based virtual screening to explore the druggability of a region in the vicinity of the fucose binding site in a lectin from an opportunistic and highly drug&#8208;resistant pathogen. The crystal structure of the target protein complexed with the lead fragment validated the existence of a secondary binding site, paving the way for the design of potent ligands to be employed in anti&#8208;adhesive therapy.







Abstract
Burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic Gram&#8208;negative bacterium that causes infections in patients suffering from chronic granulomatous diseases and cystic fibrosis. It displays significant morbidity and mortality due to extreme resistance to almost all clinically useful antibiotics. The bacterial lectin BC2L&#8208;C expressed in B. cenocepacia is an interesting drug target involved in bacterial adhesion and subsequent deadly infection to the host. We solved the first high resolution crystal structure of the apo form of the lectin N&#8208;terminal domain (BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt) and compared it with the ones complexed with carbohydrate ligands. Virtual screening of a small fragment library identified potential hits predicted to bind in the vicinity of the fucose binding site. A series of biophysical techniques and X&#8208;ray crystallographic screening were employed to validate the interaction of the hits with the protein domain. The X&#8208;ray structure of BC2L&#8208;C&#8208;nt complexed with one of the identified active fragments confirmed the ability of the site computationally identified to host drug&#8208;like fragments. The fragment affinity could be determined by titration microcalorimetry. These structure&#8208;based strategies further provide an opportunity to elaborate the fragments into high affinity anti&#8208;adhesive glycomimetics, as therapeutic agents against B. cenocepacia.

Seven 3D uranyl organic frameworks have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate linker. These UOFs have diverse 3D self&#8208;assembled architectures as a function of pH, co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals.







Abstract
Seven three dimensional (3D) uranyl organic frameworks (UOFs), formulated as [NH4][(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)] (1), [(UO2)4(HTTDS)2](HIM)6 (2, IM=imidazole), [(UO2)4(TTDS)(H2O)2(Phen)2] (3, Phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), [Zn(H2O)4]0.5[(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)4] (4), and {(UO2)2[Zn(H2O)3]2(TTDS)} (5), {Zn(UO2)2(H2O)(Dib)0.5(HDib)(HTTDS)} (6, Dib=1,4&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) and [Na]{(UO2)4[Cu3(u3&#8208;OH)(H2O)7](TTDS)2} (7) have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate ligand, tetrakis(3,5&#8208;dicarboxyphenyl)silicon(H8TTDS). These UOFs have different 3D self&#8208;assembled structures as a function of co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals. The structure of 1 has an infinite ribbon formed by the UO7 pentagonal bipyramid bridged by carboxylate groups. With further introduction of auxiliary N&#8208;donor ligands, different structure of 2 and 3 are formed, in 2 the imidazole serves as space filler, while in 3 the Phen are bound to [UO2]2+ units as co&#8208;ligands. The second metal centers were introduced in the syntheses of 4&#8211;7, and in all cases, they are part of the final structures, either as a counterion (4) or as a component of framework (5&#8722;7). Interesting, in 7, a rare polyoxometalate [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)O7(O2CR)4] cluster was found in the structure. It acts as an inorganic building unit together with the dimer [(UO2)2(O2CR)4] unit. Those uranyl carboxylates were sufficiently determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their topological structures and luminescence properties were analyzed in detail.

         <title>Rational Enzyme Design without Structural Knowledge: A Sequence&#8208;Based Approach for Efficient Generation of Transglycosylases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10323-10334, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although glycosylation is common in Nature, it remains a challenge for organic chemistry. Herein, a method to obtain transglycosylases from retaining glycoside hydrolases is described. The approach pinpoints 6&#8211;12 single&#8208;point mutants to assay. Invariably across six GH families, this generates enzyme variants that display increased transglycosylation yields, an improvement that is mostly due to a relative decrease in hydrolysis compared to transglycosylation. The method only requires sequence information, is fast and applicable to a broad range of glycosides.







Abstract
Glycobiology is dogged by the relative scarcity of synthetic, defined oligosaccharides. Enzyme&#8208;catalysed glycosylation using glycoside hydrolases is feasible but is hampered by the innate hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time&#8208;consuming screening and analysis. Here, a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid in silico analysis of protein sequences is described. The method pinpoints 6&#8211;12 single&#8208;mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various d/l&#8208;, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;pyranosides or furanosides, and exo or endo action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.

         <title>Hydrosilane &#963;&#8208;Adduct Intermediates in an Adaptive Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;dehydrocoupling of Si&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bonds</title>

&#963;&#8208;Silane adducts and alcohol adducts are kinetically detected intermediates in zinc&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis&#8208;type dehydrocoupling reactions. These intermediates feature prominently in the reactivity of coordinatively unsaturated zinc centers, which efficiently mediate Si&#8722;O bond formation. The catalyst is responsive to reaction conditions, adapting as a function of concentration to follow the kinetically preferred mechanism.







Abstract
Three&#8208;coordinate PhBOX
ZnR (PhBOX
=phenyl&#8208;(4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;oxazolinato; R=Me: 2&#8201;a, Et: 2&#8201;b) catalyzes the dehydrocoupling of primary or secondary silanes and alcohols to give silyl ethers and hydrogen, with high turnover numbers (TON; up to 107) under solvent&#8208;free conditions. Primary and secondary silanes react with small, medium, and large alcohols to give various degrees of substitution, from mono&#8208; to tri&#8208;alkoxylation, whereas tri&#8208;substituted silanes do not react with MeOH under these conditions. The effect of coordinative unsaturation on the behavior of the Zn catalyst is revealed through a dramatic variation of both rate law and experimental rate constants, which depend on the concentrations of both the alcohol and hydrosilane reactants. That is, the catalyst adapts its mechanism to access the most facile and efficient conversion. In particular, either alcohol or hydrosilane binds to the open coordination site on the PhBOX
ZnOR catalyst to form a PhBOX
ZnOR(HOR) complex under one set of conditions or an unprecedented &#963;&#8208;adduct PhBOX
ZnOR(H&#8722;SiR&#8242;3) under other conditions. Saturation kinetics provide evidence for the latter species, in support of the hypothesis that &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactions involving four&#8208;centered electrocyclic 2&#963;&#8211;2&#963; transition states are preceded by &#963;&#8208;adducts.

An unexpected balancing act! The efficient phosphorus&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot formal (4+1)&#8208;cycloaddition between an in&#8197;situ generated oxyphosphonium enolate and an ortho&#8208;quinone methide provides spirooxindole benzofurans in appreciable yields and diastereoselectivity despite a delicate balance of intermediate equilibria.







Abstract
An efficient and convergent (4+1)&#8208;cycloaddition strategy toward the construction of spirooxindole benzofurans that involves the intermediacy of an isatin&#8208;derived oxyphosphonium enolate is presented. Mechanistic investigations employing in&#8197;situ NMR analysis of the reaction mixture revealed a correlation between phosphonium enolate structure and product distribution that was heavily influenced by the solvent and reaction temperature.

DNA, Protein, RNA: The structure&#8208;based design of biomolecular conjugates composed of protein and DNA fragments that synergistically bind RNA via Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing and peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics were designed whereby two conjugates can simultaneously assemble on a single RNA scaffold. Through ternary complex formation, the peptide elements of each conjugate are drawn into close proximity, and this feature was exploited to enable an RNA&#8208;templated, double click reaction.







Abstract
Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates that bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.

EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of a nonadentate bispidine derivative were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand, and the identical emission spectra in the solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields, making these complexes a possible basis for interesting biological probes.







Abstract
EuIII, TbIII, GdIII and YbIII complexes of the nonadentate bispidine derivative L2 (bispidine=3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) were successfully synthesized and their emission properties studied. The X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals full encapsulation by the nonadentate ligand L2 that enforces to all LnIII cations a common highly symmetrical capped square antiprismatic (CSAPR) coordination geometry (pseudo C4v symmetry). The well&#8208;resolved identical emission spectra in solid state and in solution confirm equal structures in both media. As therefore expected, this results in long&#8208;lived excited states and high emission quantum yields ([EuIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.51&#8197;ms, &#981;=0.35; [TbIIIL2]+, H2O, 298&#8197;K, &#964;=1.95&#8197;ms, &#981;=0.68). Together with the very high kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities, these complexes are a possible basis for interesting biological probes.

Inspired by the structure of spongy bone, we synthesized 3D sponge&#8208;like porous carbons (SPCs) from CO2 in a home&#8208;made electrolytic cell equipped with low&#8208;temperature molten carbonate electrolyte. SPC4&#8208;0.5 shows excellent electrochemical capacitance performance due to its large&#8208;area meso&#8208;microporous structure, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity. Our research presents a simple, eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way towards production of functional carbon materials.







Abstract
Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO2 in molten carbonate Li2CO3&#8722;Na2CO3&#8722;K2CO3 at 580&#8201;&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO2 at 4&#8197;A for 0.5&#8197;h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9&#8201;%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene[C70] Microcrystals: From Perfect Cubes, Defective Hoppers to Novel Cruciform&#8208;Pillars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10387-10393, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C70 microcrystals with high uniformity from perfect cubes, defective hoppers to novel cruciform&#8208;pillars were obtained by reprecipitation method. Among them, novel pillar&#8208;shaped microcrystals are obtained for the first time by further decreasing the amount of mesitylene. The hopper&#8208;shaped microcrystals exhibit excellent photoluminescence properties relative to those of cubes and cruciform&#8208;pillars owing to the enhanced light absorption, proving their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Controlled crystallization of fullerene molecules into ordered molecular assemblies is important for their applications. However, the morphology engineering of fullerene[C70] assemblies is challenging, and complicated architectures have rarely been reported due to the low molecular symmetry of C70 molecules, which makes their crystallization difficult to control and the low production yield as well. Herein, with the assistance of solvent intercalation, a general reprecipitation approach is reported to prepare morphologically controllable C70 microcrystals with mesitylene as a good solvent and n&#8208;propanol as a poor solvent in one solvent system without replacing specific solvents. A series of C70 microcrystals with high uniformity from perfect cubes and defective hoppers to novel cruciform&#8208;pillars are obtained by intentionally tuning C70 concentration and the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Among them, novel cruciform&#8208;pillar&#8208;shaped microcrystals are obtained for the first time by further decreasing the amount of mesitylene in the solvent&#8208;intercalated microcrystals. Notably, the C70 concentration is a key parameter for the selective growth of C70 hopper, rather than the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Interestingly, the hopper&#8208;shaped microcrystals exhibit excellent photoluminescence properties relative to those of cubes and cruciform&#8208;pillars owing to the enhanced light absorption, proving their potential applications in optoelectronic devices. This study offers new insights into the morphology&#8208;controlled synthesis of other micro/nanostructured organic microcrystals and the fine tuning of photoluminescence properties of organic crystals.

         <title>Cover Feature: Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and Its Two&#8208;Sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry (Chem. Eur. J. 40/2021)</title>

The &#8220;two&#8208;sided nature&#8221; of the Ia3d gyroid&#8208;type bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (Cubbi LC) phase of a nonsymmetric core molecule is depicted in the cover image. Two core assembly modes specific to each symmetric molecule with larger naphthalene or smaller benzene cores appear to form the three&#8208;dimensional helical network, depending on temperature and thermal cycle. The finding reveals that the core symmetry can control the core packing and stability of the network structure. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Kutsumizu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101233).

&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums via a halogen &#8216;dance&#8217; was realized in a batch reactor. This method allows selective generation of isomeric azolylzinc species from a single starting material using newly synthesized bench&#8208;stable zinc halide diamine complexes, leading to the divergent and stereoselective synthesis of functionalized azoles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Okano et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101256).

The graphic depicts &#8220;Engi&#8208;Kumade&#8221;, a Japanese traditional charm for better fortune, sometimes used as an auspicious object for collecting luck or economic fortune. The enantioconvergent process can be considered an auspicious transformation in asymmetric synthesis as the reaction affords enantioenriched products, that is, valuable ones, from racemic reactants. Several mechanistically different approaches for organocatalytic enantioconvergent processes have been established. For more details see the Minireview by M. Terada and J.

Extended enolates, particularly dienolates, may be generated upon deprotonation of &#945;,&#946;(and most usually &#946;,&#947;)&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds by treatment with base. While known for more than half a century, their use in catalytic asymmetric bond&#8208;forming reactions has remained underdeveloped until recently. The Minireview by M. Oiarbide and C. Palomo on page 10226 highlights the reactivity and selectivity problems encountered during their catalytic generation and subsequent reaction control, and how both metallic and organic catalysts complement to make direct and enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of various categories of enolizable compounds via dienolate intermediates feasible.

The vibrational frequency of CO, which binds to different electrophilic anions [B12X11]&#8208; (X=F, Cl, Br, I), is determined by an interplay of blue&#8208;shifting electrostatics (blue beam between boron and carbon) and red shifting &#960;&#8208;backdonation (flames). For X=Cl, Br, I, (upper half) electrostatics dominates, while for X=F (bottom) &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates and binds CO exceptionally strongly. Measured spectra are shown on the right. The band of unbound CO would be found at the position of the laser beam. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Mayer, J. Warneke, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100949).

Extend and divert. Extended enolates may be generated by deprotonation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds smoothly, to react with a variety of electrophiles in&#8197;situ. Easier to form than the parent simple enolates, di&#8208; and trienolates present, however, two nucleophilic carbons (typically C&#945; and C&#947;) potentially leading to regioisomeric products. In recent years, methods based on both metallic and organic chiral catalysts have been developed able to address some of these site&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues, enabling direct asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization of carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.

&lt;p&gt;Catalyst-controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site- and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate-catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.&lt;/p&gt;

Enantioselective catalysis using organocatalysts is a highly desirable process for the synthesis of organic molecules in an enantioenriched form. This minireview highlights recent achievements in the development of enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts. The contents are classified on the basis of the mechanistic types of enantioconvergent processes.







Abstract
Over the past decades, the development of enantioselective catalysis using organocatalysts has evolved into an active research field and a number of enantioselective transformations have been established. However, despite their being a highly desirable process for the synthesis of organic molecules in an enantioenriched form, the enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts still present several challenges. Although intrinsic difficulties in the catalytic stereocontrol abound due to the initial chiral information of racemic electrophiles, in recent years, mechanistically diverse enantioconvergent processes have been intensively investigated in organocatalysis. This Minireview focuses on recent achievements in the development of enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts. The contents are classified on the basis of the mechanistic types of enantioconvergent processes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenation of Chiral Nitroalkanes: An Easy Entry to &#945;&#8208;Substituted Enantiomerically Enriched Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10247-10250, July 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective divergent methodology for the reduction of aliphatic nitro compounds into nitriles and amines has been developed. The protocol efficiently affords optically active nitriles starting from chiral nitroalkanes. In the reaction inexpensive bulk chemicals are employed and the use of heavy metals is precluded, thereby excluding potential contamination of the product by metal impurities.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes has been developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes were selectively converted into amines or nitriles. Furthermore, when chiral &#946;&#8208;substituted nitro compounds were reacted, the stereochemical integrity of the stereocenter was maintained and &#945;&#8208;functionalized nitriles were obtained with no loss of enantiomeric excess. The methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, and TBS&#8208;protected cyanohydrins, including direct precursors of four active pharmaceutical ingredients (ibuprofen, tembamide, aegeline and denopamine).

         <title>Unbalanced 2D Chiral Crystallization of Pentahelicene Propellers and Their Planarization into Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 40, Page 10251-10254, July 16, 2021. </description>

From helical to planar: Molecular propellers built up by three pentahelicene subunits self&#8208;assemble on a gold surface into enantiomerically unbalanced two&#8208;dimensional crystal domains. Upon thermal treatment of the close&#8208;packed monolayer, intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation into planar nanographenes occurs. Further thermal treatment leads in part to fusion into larger graphene flakes of up to four nanographene units by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.







Abstract
The chiral self&#8208;assembly of trispentahelicene propellers on a gold surface has been investigated in ultrahigh vacuum by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The trispentahelicene propellers aggregate into mirror domains with an enantiomeric ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation leads to planarization into nanographenes, which self&#8208;assemble into closed&#8208;packed layers with two different azimuths. Further treatment induces in part dimerization and trimerization by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.

         <title>Synergistic Ir/Cu Catalysis for Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Oxindoles: Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Construction of Quaternary and Tertiary Stereocenters</title>

Synergistic Ir/Cu Catalysis: a highly regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkyl oxindoles was developed through synergistic iridium and copper catalysis, providing a series of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives containing adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in excellent yields, enantiomeric excess, and diastereomeric ratio (for 30&#8197;examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;% ee, and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
3,3&#8208;Disubstituted oxindoles bearing quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers are privileged structural motifs, which widely exist in pharmaceutical and natural products. Herein, a highly regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkyl oxindoles through synergistic iridium and copper catalysis is described, which provides a series of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives containing adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in excellent yields, enantiomeric excess, and diastereomeric ratio (for 30 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield, &gt;99&#8201;% ee, and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). This method provides exclusive branched selectivity, excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, and good functional compatibility. Control experiments suggested that the chiral copper catalyst is required for achieving high reactivities and diastereoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.

New wheels for cycloisomerizations: We report the synthesis of novel trinuclear triphosphine&#8208;gold(I)&#8208;calix[6]arene complexes A and B. These multitasking supramolecular wheels, which could be employed as a platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxanes species, displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective cycloisomerizations of 1,6&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of novel triphosphine calix[6]arene ligands. These supramolecular wheels, with recognition features governed by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding domain, were employed to synthesize multitasking trinuclear gold(I) complexes as a new platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxane species. In parallel, the multivalent, metal&#8208;bonded upper rim displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

In parallel, the multivalent, metal-bonded upper rim displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective gold-catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6-enynes.&lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;The selective trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums in a &#8216;halogen dance&#8217; was realized in a batch reactor, by choosing an appropriate zinc halide diamine complex as the transmetalating agent. The concept that the selectivity is switched by the diamine ligand is unprecedented, in contrast to flow chemistry which controls the reaction time precisely. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0&#8197;&#176;C with high reproducibility on a multi&#8208;gram scale.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;10267&#8197;ff.

         <title>Type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8211;&#948;Ge136 from a Redox&#8208;Preparation Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  was obtained from Na  12  Ge  17  by applying a two&#8208;step procedure. At first, Na  12  Ge  17  was reacted at 70&#160;&#176;C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na  12  Ge  17  , but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340&#160;&#176;C in argon atmosphere, the X&#8209;ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  (  d  &#8776; 2) and a&#8209;Ge in an about 1:1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X&#8209;ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and  23  Na solid&#8208;state NMR. Metallic properties of Na  24&#8211;  &#948;  Ge  136  were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the  23  Na NMR signals and by a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques for the Structural Characterization of Geminal Alane&#8208;Phosphane Frustrated Lewis Pairs and Secondary Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane Frustrated L  ewis  Pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. Their relevant NMR parameters (isotropic chemical shifts, direct and indirect  27  Al&#8208;  31  P spin&#8208;spin coupling constants, and  27  Al nuclear electric quadrupole coupling tensor components) have been determined by numerical analysis of the experimental NMR lineshapes and compared with values computed from the known crystal structures using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our work demonstrates that the  31  P NMR chemical shifts for the studied Al/P FLPs are very sensitive to slight structural inequivalences. The  27  Al NMR central transition signals are spread out over a broad frequency range (&gt;200 kHz), owing to the presence of strong nuclear electric quadrupolar interactions that can be well&#8208;reproduced by the static  27  Al Wideband Uniform Rate Smooth Truncation (WURST) Carr&#8722;Purcell&#8722;Meiboom&#8722;Gill (WCPMG) NMR experiment.  27  Al chemical shifts and quadrupole tensor components offer a facile and clear distinction between three&#8208; and four&#8208;coordinate aluminum environments. For measuring internuclear Al  &#8230;.  P distances a new Resonance&#8208;Echo Saturation&#8208;Pulse Double&#8208;Resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept WURST pulses. The successful implementation of this widely applicable technique indicates that internuclear Al  &#8230;.  P distances in these compounds can be measured within a precision of &#177;0.1 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI = Li &#8211; Cs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The full series of quasibinary alkali metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (  A  = Li&#8211;Rb) or by metathesis (  A  = Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN] &#8226; 2H  2  O).</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds&#160;(Part 1): Controlled Hydrolysis of Micellar Amphiphilic Imines in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their intrinsic hydrolysable character, imine bonds can become remarkably stable in water when self&#8208;assembled in amphiphilic micellar structures. In the present article, we systematically study some of these structures and the influence of various parameters that can be used to take control over their hydrolysis, including pH, concentration, position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure, relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Thermodynamic and kinetic data lead us to the rational design of stable imines in water, partly based on the location of the imine function within the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile and on a predictable quantitative term that we define as the total hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB). In addition, we show that such stable systems are also stimuli&#8208;responsive and therefore, of potential interest in trapping and releasing micellar components on demand.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Amphiphilic imines prepared by condensation of a hydrophobic fragrance aldehyde with a hydrophilic amine derived from a hydrophilic poly(propylene oxide) and poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer were investigated as cleavable surfactant profragrances in applications of functional perfumery. In water, the cleavable surfactants assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Dynamic headspace analysis on a glass surface showed that solubilized perfume molecules evaporated in a similar manner in the presence of the cleavable surfactant as compared with a non&#8208;cleavable reference surfactant. Under application conditions, the cleavable surfactant imine hydrolysed to release the covalently linked fragrance aldehyde. The profragrances were stable during storage in aqueous media and upon dilution showed a blooming effect for the hydrolytical fragrance release and a more balanced performance of a solubilized perfume by retaining the more volatile fragrances and boosting the evaporation of the less volatile fragrances.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Cy3 FRET System to Analyze Photoactive DNA Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new FRET system for structural analyses of DNA duplexes using perylene and Cy3 as donor and acceptor, respectively, linked at the termini of a DNA duplex via D&#8208;threoninol. Experimentally obtained FRET efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated based on canonical B&#8208;form DNA. Due to the relatively long F&#246;rster radius, this system can be used to analyze large DNA structures, and duplexes containing photo&#8208;reactive molecules can be analyzed since perylene can be excited with visible light. The system was used to analyze a DNA duplex containing stilbene, demonstrating that in the region of the stilbene cluster the duplex adopts a ladder&#8208;like structure rather than helical one. Upon photodimerization between stilbene residues, FRET efficiencies indicated the reaction does not disturb DNA duplex. This FRET system will be useful for analysis of photoreactions of nucleobases as well as a wide range of nucleic acid structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis&#8208;Pair Neighbors at the Xanthene Framework: Epimerization at Phosphorus and Cooperative Formation of Macrocyclic Adduct Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meso and rac diastereoisomers of two P&#8208;stereogenic 4,5&#8208;bis(mesityl,alkynylphosphanyl)dimethylxanthenes underwent slow thermally induced interconversion. The activation barrier of the P&#8208;propynyl derivative was determined experimentally and by DFT calculation. Adding HB(C6F5)2 to the tert&#8208;butylethynyl&#8208;P&#8208;containing system gave intramolecular pairs of geminal frustrated P/B Lewis pairs at the xanthene&#8208;derived backbone. This reaction also proceeded with epimerization of the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphanyl units. The new FLP pairs at the xanthene backbone formed bridged macrocyclic adducts with a variety of bifunctional Lewis base donors.







Abstract
Attachment of a pair of P&#8208;stereogenic mesityl(alkynyl)phosphanyl groups at the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of a 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene framework gave mixtures of the respective rac&#8208; and meso&#8208;bisphosphanyl diastereoisomers. They slowly epimerized in a thermally induced reaction with Gibbs activation barriers of about 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at room temperature (measured and DFT calculated). The reaction of the meso&#8208;mesityl(tert&#8208;butylethynyl)phosphanyl derivative with two molar equivalents of Piers&#8242; borane [HB(C6F5)2] led to the formation of the alkylidene&#8208;bridged geminal bisphosphane/borane&#8208;frustrated Lewis pair system. The compound was obtained enriched (&gt;85&#8201;%) in the rac diastereoisomer. With a variety of bifunctional donor substrates, the rac&#8208;bis&#8208;P/B FLP formed macrocyclic compounds. They were all formally derived from meso&#8208;configurated diastereoisomers of the bisphosphanylxanthene backbone.

         <title>Polymerization of Allenes by Using an Iron(II) &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Pre&#8208;Catalyst to Generate High Mn Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare example of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of aryl allenes is presented. Reactions are mild and generate very high Mn polymers with narrow polydispersity by using a well&#8208;defined Fe(II) pre&#8208;catalyst and a hydride additive. [2+2] cycloaddition to form cyclobutanes is also viable using the same catalytic system.







Abstract
Herein, we report an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co&#8208;catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to Mn=189 000&#8197;Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically, we postulate that the co&#8208;catalyst does not react to form an iron(II) hydride in&#8197;situ, but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclobutane side&#8208;product is also investigated.

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time for an upgrade: The separation of alkane isomers is investigated on a simple, easily available metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Co3(HCOO)6. The compound is capable of splitting monobranched and dibranched alkanes through selective molecular exclusion. In addition, the material exhibits excellent separation of naphtha, outperforming benchmark zeolites and MOFs, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation and RON upgrading.







Abstract
The separation of alkanes, particularly monobranched and dibranched isomers, is of paramount importance in the petrochemical industry for optimizing the feedstock of ethylene production as well as for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Here, we report the full separation of linear/monobranched alkanes from their dibranched isomers by a robust and easily scalable metal&#8208;organic framework material, Co3(HCOO)6. The compound completely excludes dibranched alkanes but adsorbs their linear and monobranched isomers, as evidenced by single&#8208;component and multicomponent adsorption measurements. More importantly, the material exhibits excellent performance in separating naphtha and is capable of providing high quality feedstock for the production of ethylene and gasoline components with high octane number, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation in petrochemical industry.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>More than six decades after proposing copper acetylide, Cu  2  C  2  , as catalytically active species in ethynylation reactions by Walter Reppe, the explosive species have been experimentally identified and investigated during catalysis in detail now. Taking into account specific safety precautions, unequivocal qualitative characterization was achieved by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction of supported copper catalysts Cu/Bi/SiO  2  during and after activation and catalysis in comparison to bulk Cu  2  C  2  materials. Quantification of Cu  2  C  2  succeeded by thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Its formation in aqueous suspension is studied starting from copper(II) oxide catalysts including dissolution, reduction and precipitation steps. Copper acetylide formation can be correlated with catalytic performance in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol.</dc:description>

Copper acetylide formation can be correlated with catalytic performance in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4-butynediol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze four distinct processes: 1)&#8197;aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, 2)&#8197;intramolecular arylation, 3)&#8197;homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and 4)&#8197;Suzuki coupling. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Iwata, M. Shindo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101728).

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium oxide photocatalysts with ordered domains of less than 7 &#197; in size were synthesized from titanium(IV) ethoxide as molecular precursor. UV light induces a color change from white to dark, corresponding to a change in the oxidation state of Ti. Upon heating, the structural order in the core of the as&#8208;synthesized particle extends. During transformation to anatase, the changes in the local structure were investigated by in situ total scattering experiments and subsequent pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101117).

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the cleavage of C&#8722;X single bonds, the photoreaction of the C=C bonds of electron&#8208;rich oxidative alkenes remains a challenge. This work presents a novel photoactivation of dialkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY photocages to release para&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde under visible light illumination in an aqueous environment through a formal [2+2] cycloaddition of singlet oxygen and a double bond. A real&#8208;time monitoring assay revealed that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cancer cells and release an aldehyde and a biothiol probe under illumination. More information can be found in the Communication by J. Geng et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101833).

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite Has a Significantly Enhanced Photo&#8208;electrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green technology that protects metals from corrosion as it uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials. A CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite film with electron self&#8208;storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photoelectrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuous cathodic protection in the dark. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Chen et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101479).

         <dc:description>The story of C&#8208;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Osteosarcoma stem cell potent gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes bearing diflunisal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series,  6  (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably,  6  exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that  6  downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore,  6  induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge,  6  is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Alkali Cation Intercalates on the Electrochemical Characteristics of Nb2CTX Mxene for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intercalation of cations into layered structure electrode materials has long been studied in depth in energy storage applications. In particular, Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  alkali metal&#8208;based cation transports in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors are closely related to the capacitance behavior. Herein, we exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolyte intercalating into layered Nb  2  CT  x  electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li  2  SO  4  , Na  2  SO  4  , and K  2  SO  4  electrolytes with the increased  d  &#8208;spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb  2  CT  x  electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li  2  SO  4  than in that of Na  2  SO  4  and K  2  SO  4  . This is partly because smaller size Li  +  transports fast and intercalates between the layers of Nb  2  CT  x  easily. Poor ion transport in the Na  2  SO  4  electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius is following Li  +  &gt;Na  +  &gt;K  +  . Our experimental studies provide direct evidence for the intercalation mechanism of Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  on the 2D layered Nb  2  CT  x  electrode, which provides a new path for exploring the relationship between intercalated cations and other MXene electrodes</dc:description>

         <title>Binding sites, vibrations and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times in europium(II)&#8208;based metallofullerene spin qubits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically&#8208;designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.e. metal&#8208;cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low energy metal&#8208;based vibrations in mediating the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (  T  1  ). The temperature dependence of  T  1  can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS  2  solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin&#8208;vibration coupling in these EMF&#8208;based qubit candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconductor Heterojunctions for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic structure calculations provide a useful complement to experimental characterization tools in the atomic&#8208;scale design of semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalysis. The band alignment of the heterojunction is of fundamental importance to achieve an efficient charge carriers separation, so as to reduce electron/hole recombination and improve photoactivity. The accurate prediction of the offsets of valence and conduction bands in the constituent units is thus of key importance but poses several methodological and practical problems. In this Minireview we address some of these problems by considering selected examples of binary and ternary semiconductor heterojunctions and how these are determined at the level of density functional theory (DFT). The atomically precise description of the interface, the consequent charge polarization, the role of quantum confinement, the possibility to use facet engineering to determine a specific band alignment, are among the effects discussed, with particular attention to pros and cons of each one of these aspects. This analysis shows the increasingly important role of accurate electronic structure calculations to drive the design and the preparation of new interfaces with desired properties.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an ongoing interest in  1  O  2  sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes  2  o  &#9472;  p  and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for  1  O  2  . In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA  1  O  2  is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of  2  o  &#8211;  p  with DNA were investigated by various analytical methods. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA:dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer  2  o  in poly(dA:dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of  1  O  2  was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of  1  O  2  quenchers. When bound to poly(dG:dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers  2  o  and  2  m  , namley the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical  1  O  2  generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To fulfill the demand of precision and personalized medicine, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been emerged as a frontier in the biomedical fields due to the enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. Herein, we present a biocompatible and versatile nanoagent consisting of single&#8208;atom iron&#8208;containing nanoparticles (SAF NPs), DOX and A549 cell membrane (CM). The designed porous Iron&#8208;based SACs was originally served as a drug&#8208;carrying nanoplatform to release DOX selectively in tumor microenvironment (TME) for tumor chemotherapy (CT) due to the high loading capacity (155%) for DOX, which signifies SACs are a promising candidate for universal delivery cargo. Besides, the designed single&#8208;atom nanoagent can perform like peroxidase, which effectively trigger in situ tumor&#8208;specific Fenton reaction to generate abundant toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) selectively under the acidic TME for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). With the combination of CDT and CT, the constructed SAF NPs@DOX@CM nanoagent demonstrate better in vivo therapeutic performance than single&#8208;pathway therapy. In the meantime, after modified with CM, SAF NPs@DOX@CM can achieve homologous binding to target tumor tissues and avoid early clearance. This study presents a type of multifunctional SACs for enhanced cancer treatment via the capacity of drug carrier combined with enzymatic therapies of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8722; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In this study, the first coordination of S&#8208;N moieties in the form of tetraimido sulfate ligands to lanthanide ions is showcased, which resulted in the isolation of unprecedented mono&#8208; and bimetallic lanthanide tetraimido sulfate complexes with gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, and erbium. In particular, the bimetallic dysprosium complex and the monometallic terbium and dysprosium compounds showed single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Ionization and Photofragmentation of Isolated Metalloporphyrin Cations Investigated by VUV Action Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated metalloporphyrin cations FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+ have been studied in the gas phase by action spectroscopy in the vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) range using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and synchrotron radiation. The ionization energy of each compound has been measured. Photoexcitation and photoionization lead to strikingly different fragmentation pathways. Evidence for non&#8208;statistical dissociation processes including water losses were identified. Fragment assignments have been supported by additional high&#8208;resolution collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments on a hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbital mass spectrometer.







Abstract
We investigated the photoionization and fragmentation of isolated metal protoporphyrin IX cations (MPPIX+ with M=Fe, Co, Zn) by means of vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) action spectroscopy in the energy range of 8.5&#8211;35&#8197;eV. Experiments were carried out in the gas phase by interfacing an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer with a synchrotron beamline. The mass spectra and partial ion yields show that photoexcitation of the precursor ions predominantly leads to .CH2COOH radical side&#8208;chain losses of the macrocycle with additional methyl radical (.CH3) side&#8208;chain losses. Ionization, in contrast, leads to the formation of the intact ionized precursor and various doubly charged fragments which are mostly due to side&#8208;chain cleavages. Although statistical fragmentation dominates, we found evidence for non&#8208;statistical processes such as new fragments involving for example single and double H2O losses, indicating that different relaxation mechanisms are at play upon photoionization compared to photoexcitation. The measured ionization energies were 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV, 9.4&#177;0.2&#8197;eV and 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV for FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+, respectively.

         <title>Design Strategies of Si/C Composite Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various Si/C materials by different synthetic methods are reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by Si and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of Si are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li2TiO3 materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, become a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon&#8208;based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.

         <title>How to Prepare Kinetically Stable Self&#8208;assembled Pt12L24 Nanocages while Circumventing Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Avoiding the unwanted: Robust Pt12L24 assemblies were selectively formed by a combination of thermodynamic tuning, achieved by rigidifying the ligands, and kinetic tuning with catalytic amounts of additives. The described methodology can be applied to prepare a variety of functionalised platinum assemblies that were shown to be kinetically stable against biologically and catalytically relevant substrates.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanostructures have been widely studied, and currently various applications are being explored. For several applications, the stability of the nanostructure is of key importance, and this strongly depends on the metal used in the self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, design strategies and synthetic protocols to access desirable kinetically stable Pt12L24 nanospheres are reported, and it is demonstrated that these are stable under conditions under which the palladium counterparts decompose. Descriptors previously used for palladium nanospheres are insufficient for platinum analogues, as the stronger metal&#8211;ligand bond results in a mixture of kinetically trapped structures. We report that next to the dihedral angle, the rigidity of the ditopic ligand is also a key parameter for the controlled formation of Pt12L24 nanospheres. Catalytic amounts of coordinating additives to labilise the platinum&#8208;pyridyl bond to some extent are needed to selectively form Pt12L24 assemblies. The formed Pt12L24 nanospheres were demonstrated to be stable in the presence of chloride, amines and acids, unlike the palladium analogues.

         <title>The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;Based Brucite&#8208;Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts</title>

         <dc:description>
Grafting of interlayer anions to brucite&#8208;type layered structures impacts electrocatalytic performance. Three Ni and Co compounds are investigated: (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 (no interlayer anions), (ii) LDHs (free interlayer anions), and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts (grafted interlayer anions). Substitution of OH&#8722; by NO3&#8722; allows for larger layer separation and reduced electron density at the metal center contributing to earlier onset of OER activity.







Abstract
The urge for carbon&#8208;neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite&#8208;type materials as low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite&#8208;type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth&#8208;abundant Fe3+ containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe3+ rich Co&#8722;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite&#8208;like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite&#8208;type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.34&#8197;V) and medium current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.40&#8197;V) compared to the corresponding brucite&#8208;type hydroxides and LDH materials.

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8722; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have great potential application in a range of pioneering areas, such as quantum computing, spintronics, and high&#8208;density information storage. The properties of the molecules presented here are based on the molecular total spin and the magnetic anisotropy created by the lanthanides in a particular crystal field. An important element in SMMs&#8217; optimization is the ligand design. Poly imido sulfur ligands are perfectly suited as the polar S+&#8722;N&#8722;&#8208;bond facilitates electronic and geometric adaptability to various f&#8208;metals. Particularly the acute N&#8211;Dy&#8211;N bite angle generates advantageous magnetic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Demir, D. Stalke et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101076).

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, phosphanylalumane, was found to bind relatively small terminal alkenes (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene). Although the ethylene adduct did notundergo any elimination of ethylene even under vacuum conditions, heating the terminal alkene adducts resulted in the release of the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond. Theethylene adduct can work as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), showing characteristic reactivity through the elimination of ethylene. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Mizuhata, N. Tokitoh, and T. Yanagisawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101649).

         <dc:description>
The quite &#8216;hidden&#8217; compound AlCr2 was isolated for the first time as micro&#8208;fabricated single crystals. Crystal structure and chemical bonding analyses reveal largely different interactions as a consequence of the inverted coloring pattern with respect to prototypical MoSi2. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Borrmann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100817).

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the mechanochemical synthesis of cubic ZnS from its elements via ball milling was studied by in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments coupled with gas pressure measurements inside the milling vessel. The combination of both techniques reveals a heterogeneous reaction mechanism including gaseous sulfur and solid zinc. Moreover, the reaction kinetics of the phase transition from cubic to hexagonal ZnS was determined from the in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101260).

         <title>Imidazolium Functionalized Chemically Robust Ionic Porous Organic Polymers (iPOPs) toward Toxic Oxo&#8208;pollutants Capture from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating new and efficient materials aimed at containment of water contamination, in particular removing toxic heavy metal based oxo&#8208;anions (for example CrO  4  2&#8208;  , TcO  4  &#8208;  ) holds paramount importance. In this work, we report two new highly stable imidazolium based ionic porous organic polymers (  i  POPs) decorated with multiple interaction sites along with electrostatics driven adsorptive removal of such oxo&#8208;anions from water. Both the  i  POPs (namely,  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4) exhibited rapid sieving kinetics and very high saturation uptake capacity for CrO  4  2&#8208;  anions (170 and 141 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively) and ReO  4  &#8208;  (515.5 and 350.3 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively), where ReO  4  &#8208;  anions being the non&#8208;radioactive surrogative counterpart of radioactive TcO  4  &#8208;  ions. Noticeably, both  i  POPs showed exceptional selectivity towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  even in presence of several other concurrent anions such as Br  &#8208;  , Cl  &#8208;  , SO  4  2&#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  etc. The theoretical binding energy calculations via DFT method further confirmed the preferencial interaction sites as well as binding energies of both  i  POPs towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  over all other competing anions which corroborates with the experimental high capacity and selectivity of  i  POPs towards such oxo&#8208;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinate reaction model:&#160;an obstacle for interpreting the emergence of chemical complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to be correctly simulated and understood, the chemical behavior of complex systems, requires time&#8208;dependent models ,&#160; otherwise the irreversibility of natural phenomena is overlooked. Micro reversible models based on the reaction coordinate model are time invariant and are therefore unable to explain the evolution of open dissipative systems. The important points necessary for improving the modelling and simulations of chemical complex systems are: a) The understanding of the physical potential related to the entropy production rate, which is in general a non&#8208;exact differential of a state function, and b) The interpretation and application of the so&#8208;called general evolution criteria (GEC) which is the general thermodynamic constraint for the evolution of dissipative chemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2]: A Polar 3D Lead&#8208;Bromide Framework Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of new nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with excellent properties is in urgently demand because of their ability to generate coherent light. Herein, we report an unique NLO lead bromide formate, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ], which has been synthesized by a mix&#8208;solvothermal method.  KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.5 &#215; KDP), large birefringence (0.16  @ 1064 nm), and wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region. Interestingly, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8208;Br layers containing coplanar Pb  6  Br  6  rings not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations. This research provides a new strategy to explore subsequent NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of Terminal Platinapolyynes by Copper(I) Catalyzed Click Cycloadditions; Probes of Labile Intermediates in Syntheses of Complexes with Extended sp Carbon Chains, and Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title reactions are, by analogy to a coal miner&#8216;s canary, employed to detect unstable transient species LyPt(C&#8801;C)nH with n up to 9. These are valuable building blocks for still longer polyynes, and all of the precursors LyPt(C&#8801;C)nSiR3 and trapping products can be crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
The silylated hexatriynyl complex trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)3SiEt3 (PtC6TES) is converted in&#8197;situ to PtC6H (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) and cross coupled with the diyne H(C&#8801;C)2SiEt3 (HC4TES; CuCl/TMEDA, O2) to give PtC10TES (71&#8201;%). This sequence is repeated twice to afford PtC14TES (65&#8201;%) and then PtC18TES (27&#8201;%). An analogous series of reactions starting with PtC8TES gives PtC12TES (60&#8201;%), then PtC16TES (43&#8201;%), and then PtC20TES (17&#8201;%). Similar cross couplings with H(C&#8801;C)2Si(i&#8208;Pr)3 (HC4TIPS) give PtC12TIPS (68&#8201;%), PtC14TIPS (68&#8201;%), and PtC16TIPS (34&#8201;%). The trialkylsilyl species (up to PtC18TES) are converted to 3+2 &#8220;click&#8221; cycloadducts or 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)n&#8208;1C=CHN(CH2C6H5)N=N (29&#8211;92&#8201;% after workups). The most general procedure involves generating the terminal polyynes PtCxH (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) in the presence of benzyl azide in DMF and aqueous CuSO4/ascorbic acid. All of the preceding complexes are crystallographically characterized and the structural and spectroscopic properties analyzed as a function of chain length. Two pseudopolymorphs of PtC20TES are obtained, both of which feature molecules with parallel sp carbon chains in a pairwise head/tail packing motif with extensive sp/sp van der Waals contacts.

This sequence is repeated twice to afford &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt; (65&#8201;%) and then &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt; (27&#8201;%). An analogous series of reactions starting with &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt; gives &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt; (60&#8201;%), then &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt; (43&#8201;%), and then &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt; (17&#8201;%).

The trialkylsilyl species (up to &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt;) are converted to 3+2 &#8220;click&#8221; cycloadducts or 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tol&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;

All of the preceding complexes are crystallographically characterized and the structural and spectroscopic properties analyzed as a function of chain length. Two pseudopolymorphs of &lt;b&gt;PtC&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;TES&lt;/b&gt; are obtained, both of which feature molecules with parallel sp carbon chains in a pairwise head/tail packing motif with extensive sp/sp van der Waals contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Decoding Directing Groups and Their Pivotal Role in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of directing groups in guiding C&#8722;H activation reactions are described with a detailed picture of the various directing groups that have become prominent in carrying out functionalizations at different sites of aromatic scaffolds. The review encompasses all the relevant works that have been conducted by different groups from all over the world and this provides sufficient information for readers who wish to carry out research in this domain.







Abstract
Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8722;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo&#8208; and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways via which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8722;H activation. Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8722;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. These templates have been frequently harnessed for selectively activating C&#8722;H bonds of natural products, drugs, and macromolecules decorated with multiple C&#8722;H bonds. This itself was a challenge before the commencement of this field as functionalization of a site other than the targeted site could modify and hamper the biological activity of the pharmacophore. Total synthesis and pharmacophore development often faces the difficulty of superfluous reaction steps towards selective functionalization. This obstacle has been solved by late&#8208;stage functionalization simply by harnessing C&#8722;H bond activation. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues. Therefore, metal&#8208;free catalysts or the usage of non&#8208;toxic metals have been recently showcased in a number of elegant works. Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8722;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level. This review gives the readers a broad understanding of how these strategies work, the execution of various metal catalysts, and directing groups. This not only helps a budding scientist towards the commencement of his/her research but also helps a matured mind searching out for selective functionalization. A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope. This allows an experimental chemist to understand the applicability of this domain and employ it over any targeted substrate.

In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.







Abstract
Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In particular, inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.

         <title>Inclusion Complexes of Gold(I)&#8208;Dithiocarbamates with &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: A Journey from Drug Repurposing towards Drug Discovery</title>

         <dc:description>
Inclusion complex of a complex: The two drugs disulfiram and aurothiomalate react to produce a gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate complex, which selectively kills cancer cells. Hydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives of this complex form inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin in a rare &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement. Formulation of one gold complex with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative prevents formation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate (dtc) complex [Au(N,N&#8208;diethyl)dtc]2 was identified as the active cytotoxic agent in the combination treatment of sodium aurothiomalate and disulfiram on a panel of cancer cell lines. In addition to demonstrating pronounced differential cytotoxicity to these cell lines, the gold complex showed no cross&#8208;resistance in therapy&#8208;surviving cancer cells. In the course of a medicinal chemistry campaign on this class of poorly soluble gold(I)&#8208;dtc complexes, &gt;35 derivatives were synthesized and X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to examine structural aspects of the dtc moiety. A group of hydroxy&#8208;substituted complexes has an improved solubility profile, and it was found that these complexes form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD), exhibiting a rarely observed &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement of the CD cones. Formulation of a hydroxy&#8208;substituted gold(I)&#8208;dtc complex with excess sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD prevents the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which is a major burden in the development of metallodrugs.

         <title>Taming the Antiferromagnetic Beast: Computational Design of Ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn Bonds Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn2 survival guide. DFT calculations were used to design synthetically achievable compounds featuring ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn bonds stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). We investigated the nature of the metal&#8211;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination in the generation of ultrashort Mn2 bonds in organometallic platforms featuring closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities and positive adiabatic singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Our analysis identified two classes of potential synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties were thoroughly examined.







Abstract
The development of complexes featuring low&#8208;valent, multiply bonded metal centers is an exciting field with several potential applications. In this work, we describe the design principles and extensive computational investigation of new organometallic platforms featuring the elusive manganese&#8208;manganese bond stabilized by experimentally realized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). By using DFT computations benchmarked against multireference calculations, as well as MO&#8208; and VB&#8208;based bonding analyses, we could disentangle the various electronic and structural effects contributing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as the experimental feasibility, of the systems. In particular, we explored the nature of the metal&#8208;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination to the generation of Mn2 systems featuring ultrashort metal&#8208;metal bonds, closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities, and positive adiabatic singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Our analysis identifies two distinct classes of viable synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties are thoroughly investigated.

Giving directions: A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was directed by the 2&#8208;pyridyl on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was easily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.







Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the N&#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example of the direct C6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron&#8208;rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (  h  &#8209;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of  h  &#8208;BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D&#160;layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high&#8208;energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#160;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D&#160;material. Hydrogen functionalization of  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#160;K.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new type of &#171;Gel&#228;nder&#187;&#8208;molecule based on a  ortho  &#8208;tetra&#173;phenylene core is presented.

The resulting helical chiral bicyclic architecture consist exclusively of sp  2  hybridized carbon atoms. The target structure is assembled by expanding the central  ortho  &#8208;tetraphenylene subunit with the required additional phenyl rings followed by a twofold macrocyclization. First macrocyclization attempts based on a twofold  McMurry  coupling are successful but low yielding, while the second strategy profiting from olefin metathesis provide satisfying yields. Hydrogenation of the olefins results in a saturated derivative of similar topology, allowing to study the interdependence between saturation and physico&#8208;chemical properties. The target structures are fully characterized including their solid state structures. The helical chiral bicycle is synthesized as racemate and separated into pure enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. Comparison of recorded and simulated chiroptical properties allows the assignment of the enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li  +  /Na  +  insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na&#8208;ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F doped SnO  2  &#8208;SnS  2  heterostructures nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (V  O  /V  S  ) anchored on 2D sulfur/nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  @N/S&#8208;RGO). Consequently, F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  @N/S&#8208;RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589 mAh g  &#8208;1  for Li  +  and 296 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  for Na  +  . The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by V  O  /V  S  and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge&#8208;transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  and Li/Na through heterostructure. Meanwhile, the hierarchical F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  @N/S&#8208;RGO network structure enables fast infiltration of electrolyte and improves electron/ion transportation in the electrode, and the corrosion resistance of F doping contributes to prolonged cycle stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Blue emissive materials: boron containing fluorescent compounds have been prepared starting from imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine phenols. Large Stokes shift, high absolute quantum yields and good photostability are observed in solution. TD&#8208;DFT calculations allowed to find a linear correlation between the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of these compounds and the Hammett constants of substituents R para to the hydroxyl group of the phenols.

Several boron compounds with 2&#8208;(imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols, differentiated by the nature of the substituent (R) in the para position of the hydroxy group, have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized both in solution (1H, 13C, 11B, 19F NMR) and in the solid state (X&#8208;ray). All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations allowed to define the main electronic transitions as intra ligand transitions (1ILT), which was corroborated by the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) shapes. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap was correlated to the electronic properties of the substituent R on the phenolic ring, as quantified by its &#963;p Hammett constant.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blue emissive materials&lt;/b&gt;: boron containing fluorescent compounds have been prepared starting from imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine phenols. Large Stokes shift, high absolute quantum yields and good photostability are observed in solution.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted, room temperature and redox neutral direct C&#8722;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance allow the preparation of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.

         <title>Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Cysteine and Aminopeptidase N Using meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorogenic conversion of a meso&#8208;thioester to meso&#8208;amide BODIPY dye was exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes relying on the native chemical ligation reaction mechanism. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed, and successfully applied for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively.







Abstract
meso&#8208;Carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively. The aromatic (1&#8201;a) and aliphatic (4) thioesters of meso&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte&#8208;induced conversion to the meso&#8208;amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe 1&#8201;a exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction. Probe 4 was successfully applied to the monitoring and imaging of endogenous aminopeptidase N in live cancer cells.

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs. Different Bonding Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hidden crystals: With a modified synthesis approach and micro&#8208;fabrication technique, it was possible to isolate micrometer&#8208;sized single crystals of AlCr2 from a largely polycrystalline sample. Chemical bond analysis shows close relation to elements, in contrast to a quite localized bonding pattern in the prototype, MoSi2.







Abstract
In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr2. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr2 in comparison to prototypical MoSi2 shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot on: A light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposome simultaneously loads a water&#8208;soluble drug (Dox) and photothermal transduction agents (ICG), targets the tumor site, and locally heats it up under external laser irradiation. Due to the conformational transformation of CP lipids, the anticancer drug Dox is released at a specific time and in a specific space to kill tumor cells. This brings about a combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy for the noninvasive treatment of tumors.







Abstract
Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new&#8208;generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide a more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which can lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes were developed for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus inducing thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. That Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited a significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo is also demonstrated, thus it can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control the activation of cytotoxicity at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent and CPL&#8208;Active Dispiroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes are intriguing and inherently chiral compounds with fascinating 3D architecture. Their shape could be compared to whirlpools in the Naruto Strait (&#40180;&#38272;&#12398;&#28198;&#28526;), as it is beautifully depicted in the famous woodcut by Hiroshige. Formation of the whirlpools requires special conditions and these are also required in helical compounds&#8217; syntheses. Synthesis of chiral fluorescent [7]helical indenofluorenes by using catalytic enantioselective [2+2+2]cyclotrimerization and their photophysical properties are reported. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Ne&#269;as, M. Kotora, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100759).

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium based single&#8208;site catalysts allow the production of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene with very high productivities. The picture shows a donor&#8208;functionalised indenyl chromium catalyst in action where a strong electron&#8208;donating substituent leads to an increase in catalytic activity and co&#8208;monomer incorporation. The correlation between donor strength, electronic and catalytic properties was studied systematically. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Enders et&#8197;al.

         <title>Targeted chemical modifications identify key features of carbohydrate assemblies and generate tailored carbohydrate materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular level description of carbohydrate assemblies is hampered by their structural complexity and the lack of suitable analytical methods. Here, we employed systematic chemical modifications to identify key non&#8208;covalent interactions that triggered the supramolecular assembly of a disaccharide model. While some modifications disrupted the supramolecular organization, others were tolerated, delivering important information on the aggregation process. The screening identified new geometries, including nanotubes, and twisted ribbons that were characterized with electron tomography and electron diffraction (ED) methods. This work demonstrates that the combination of synthetic chemistry and ED&#8208;methods is a powerful tool to draw correlations between the molecular structure and the nanoscale architecture of carbohydrate assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Distinction between Noble Metals Located in Mesopores from those on the External Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We compare three methods for quantitatively distinguishing the location of noble metals (NM) in mesopores from those found on the external particle surface. MCM&#8208;41 and SBA&#8208;15 with NM either preferentially located in mesopores or on the external surface were prepared and characterized by TEM. We quantified arylphosphines forming complexes with NM by  31  P MAS NMR spectroscopy. Phosphine/NM ratios drop from 2.0 to 0.2 when increasing the probe diameter from 1.08 to 1.54 nm. The reaction between NM and triphenylphosphine (TPP) within 3.0 nm MCM&#8208;41 pores takes due to confinement effects multiple weeks. In contrast, external NM react with TPP instantly. A promising method is filling the pores using the pore volume impregnation technique with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). TPP loading revealed that 66% of NM are located on the external surface of MCM&#8208;41. The pore filling method can be used in association with any probe molecule, also for the quantification of acid sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles more Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time by reacting red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. The rather large coupling constant of  1  J  P,Se  = 883 Hz is in line with a P&#8208;Se bond of high  s  &#8208;character. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me  3  Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C  5  H  5  P, as confirmed by the calculated gas phase basicities. NBO calculations further reveal that the lone pairs of the selenium atom are stabilized through donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with antibonding orbitals of the aromatic ring. Our results pave the way for new perspectives in the chemistry of phosphorus in low coordination.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8208;nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water, based on their surface modification with cationic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) and zwitterionic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate (GCPZ) binding motifs. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self&#8208;assemble at pH 1, pH 7 and pH 13, whereas they disassemble at pH 3 and pH 11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH 1 and pH 13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Benzannulated Medium&#8208;Sized Rings through a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Azido&#8208;Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden keys close the loop: Starting from phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes, pharmaceutically relevant indole&#8208;fused benzannulated eight&#8208;membered rings were constructed by exploiting &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbenes as key intermediates for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction. The necessity of the C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the cyclization to a more challenging nine&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Because benzannulated and indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized rings are found in many bioactive compounds, combining these fragments might lead to unexplored areas of biologically relevant and uncovered chemical space. Herein is shown that &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene chemistry can play an important role in solving the difficulty in the formation of medium&#8208;sized rings. Namely, phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes undergo arylative cyclization through the formation of a gold carbene intermediate to afford benzannulated indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized tetracycles. The reactions allow a range of different aryl substitution patterns and efficient access to these otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain medium&#8208;sized rings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of the semihollow&#8208;shaped C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the construction of a nine&#8208;membered ring.

Herein is shown that &#945;-imino gold carbene chemistry can play an important role in solving the difficulty in the formation of medium-sized rings. Namely, phenylene-tethered azido-alkynes undergo arylative cyclization through the formation of a gold carbene intermediate to afford benzannulated indole-fused medium-sized tetracycles. The reactions allow a range of different aryl substitution patterns and efficient access to these otherwise difficult-to-obtain medium-sized rings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of the semihollow-shaped C-dtbm ligand for the construction of a nine-membered ring.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with subLi in atomic columns by electron ptychography images with characteristic contraction in lattice parameters from advanced materials characterization is observed for the first time. The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds with detainment of facile CO bond to alcohols.







Abstract
It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.

         <title>Heterodinuclear Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III) with Na(I) Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide and Cyclohexene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear M/Na catalysts for cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide copolymerization are reported. The best catalyst comprises Co(III)/Na(I), coordinated by the macrocyclic ligand, and showing activity and selectivity values at the upper end of reported values for 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure copolymerizations. These catalysts operated without co&#8208;catalyst and maintain high activity at low loadings.







Abstract
A series heterodinuclear catalysts, operating without co&#8208;catalyst, show good performances for the ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The complexes feature a macrocyclic ligand designed to coordinate metals such as Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III), in a Schiff base &#8216;pocket&#8217;, and Na(I) in a modified crown&#8208;ether binding &#8216;pocket&#8217;. The 11 new catalysts are used to explore the influences of the metal combinations and ligand backbones over catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,3&#8217;&#8208;triethylene glycol salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=1590&#8197;h&#8722;1, &gt;99&#8201;% polymer selectivity, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10: 4000, 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=4343&#8197;h&#8722;1, 20&#8197;bar, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10&#8211;40&#8197;bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co&#8208;catalyst and instead exploit the coordination of earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal to deliver efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well&#8208;designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.

Energy efficiency and electrocatalysts: Modulating Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, which can effectively improve the PGM compounds&#8242; activity and reduce the use of noble metals. This review looks at the origin of the electrochemical activity of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds and systematically summarizes the progress of their synthetic strategies and applications in energy&#8208;relevant electrocatalysis to date.







Abstract
Pt&#8208;group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts with unique electronic structures and irreplaceable comprehensive properties play crucial roles in electrocatalysis. Anion engineering can create a series of PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) that provide a promising prospect for improving the electrocatalytic performance and use of Pt&#8208;group noble metals. This review seeks the electrochemical activity origin of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds, and systematically analyzes and summarizes their synthetic strategies and energy&#8208;relevant applications in electrocatalysis. Orientation towards the sustainable development of nonfossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion&#8208;modulated strategy for Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy a future green electrochemical energy conversion system. Based on the previous work of our group and others, this review summarizes the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) in energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis from the origin of their activity and synthetic strategies to electrochemical applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, the key problems, countermeasures and future development orientations of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds toward electrocatalytic applications are proposed.

Edge of glory: Calcium zinc borate with a new fundamental building block [B8O17], Ca1.13Zn0.87B8O14 has been successfully synthesized. It exhibits two independent interpenetrating three&#8208;dimensional (3D) B&#8722;O anion networks constructed by [B8O17] groups, only a few borates present the interpenetrating 3D framework, enriching the structural diversity of B&#8722;O configurations. The UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse&#8208;reflectance spectrum shows that it has a short UV cutoff edge (&lt;195&#8197;nm).

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite Has a Significantly Enhanced Photo&#8208;electrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>

Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect against corrosion without consuming any anode materials. A CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite film with electron self&#8208;storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuing cathodic protection in the dark. This research will promote the practical application of photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology. The CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite has a significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection performance and excellent electron storage capability (Chen et&#8197;al. at the Chinese Academy of Sciences)







Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect from corrosion and does not consume any anode materials. In this work, a CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared, and its photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO3 has a well band matching with CdIn2S4, leading to a significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance of the nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination through intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of tungsten. Moreover, it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals. This research will promote the practical application process of the photo&#8208;electrochemical CP technology.

         <title>Differentiation of Epoxide Enantiomers in the Confined Spaces of an Homochiral Cu(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework TAMOF&#8208;1 was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the kinetic resolution of styrene oxide by ring opening reactions with anilines. The linear products underwent a second KR resulting in an amplification of the final stereoselectivity (subtractive Horeau amplification effect). Computational studies rationalized the two successive KR while providing a deep understanding of the process.







Abstract
TAMOF&#8208;1, a homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) constructed from an amino acid derivative and Cu(II), was investigated as a heterogeneous catalyst in kinetic resolutions involving the ring opening of styrene oxide with a set of anilines. The branched products generated from the ring opening of styrene oxide with anilines and the unreacted epoxide were obtained with moderately high enantiomeric excesses. The linear product arising from the attack on the non&#8208;benzylic position of styrene oxide underwent a second kinetic resolution by reacting with the epoxide, resulting in an amplification of its final enantiomeric excess and a concomitant formation of an array of isomeric aminodiols. Computational studies confirmed the experimental results, providing a deep understanding of the whole process involving the two successive kinetic resolutions. Furthermore, TAMOF&#8208;1 activity was conserved after several catalytic cycles. The ring opening of a meso&#8208;epoxide with aniline catalyzed by TAMOF&#8208;1 was also studied and moderate enantioselectivities were obtained.

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust defective nickel(II) pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the organic spacers have been explored for C2H2/CO2 separation. As proven by static and dynamic gas adsorption and computational modelling the non&#8208;defective34 systems give rise to selective interactions with C2H2 over CO2 as a result of a mixture of pore confinement and H&#8208;bonding and alkyne&#8208;alkyne interactions. Creation of defects is responsible for strong interactions of cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 with a concomitant lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
C2H2/CO2 separation is a highly challenging process as a consequence of their similar physicochemical properties. In this work we have explored, by static and dynamic gas sorption techniques and computational modelling, the suitability of a series of two isoreticular robust Ni(II)pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones, for C2H2/CO2 separation. The results are consistent with high adsorption capacity and selectivity of the essayed systems towards C2H2 molecules. Furthermore, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment with KOH ethanolic solution gives rise to linker vacancy defects and incorporation of extraframework potassium ions. Creation of defects is responsible for increased adsorption capacity for both gases, however, strong interactions of the cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 molecules are responsible for a lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.

         <title>Ultradoping Boron on Si(100) via Solvothermal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultradoping introduces unprecedented dopant levels into Si, which transforms its electronic behaviour and enables its use as a next&#8208;generation electronic material. Commercialization of ultradoping is currently limited by gas&#8208;phase ultra&#8208;high vacuum requirements. Solvothermal chemistry is amenable to scale&#8208;up; however, an integral part of ultradoping is a direct chemical bond between dopants and Si and solvothermal dopant&#8208;Si surface reactions are not well&#8208;developed. This work provides the first quantified demonstration of achieving the ultradoping concentrations of Boron (~1e14 cm 2 ) using a solvothermal process. Surface characterization indicate the catalyst cross&#8208;reacted, which led to multiple surface products and caused ambiguity in experimental confirmation of direct surface attachment. Density functional theory computations elucidate that the reaction results in direct B&#8208;Si surface bonds. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work lays groundwork for emerging solvothermal ultradoping processes</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed in&#8197;situ investigation of the mechanosynthesis of the hexagonal ZnS modification (wurtzite) from its elements combining synchrotron powder diffraction and pressure measurements is presented. In addition, the subsequent phase transition from the hexagonal to the cubic structure (sphalerite) was investigated and the kinetics was explored.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S8 results in the sublimation of S8, observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133&#8197;K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of amorphous TixOy photocatalysts was studied by X&#8208;ray total scattering experiments and subsequent PDF analysis starting from titanium(IV) ethoxide precursor. Effects of the colour change upon UV illumination on the local Ti environment were investigated by PDF analysis and EELS. Transformation of amorphous TixOy to anatase&#8208;TiO2 by calcination was further examined by in&#8197;situ temperature dependent experiments.







Abstract
Amorphous TixOy with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7&#8197;&#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure to UV light, the white TixOy suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by in&#8197;situ temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8722;O environment takes place upon to 350&#8201;&#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400&#8201;&#176;C is still not fully ordered.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductors design: Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are &#960;&#8208;conjugated with saddle&#8208;shaped 3D architecture. They would be candidate as building blocks for constructing fully conjugated 3D materials that can facilitate the electron layer&#8208;layer delocalization and transport. We highlight recent conceptual progresses on the design and properties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D organic semiconducting materials based on the COT derivatives, which could give inspiration for designing next generation organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and their synthetic strategy, then we present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSMs.

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a disulphide bond to obtain a redox&#8208;responsive contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that can be used to label the lumen of alginate&#8208;based cell embedding capsules. The increase of reducing potential within the capsule microenvironment, that is related to hypoxia, can be readily detected by a decrease of MRI contrast enhancement.







Abstract
One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T1&#8208;weighted MR images.

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective oxidative cleavage of a C=C bond from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY) photocage has been realized under 630&#8197;nm illumination; this generated an aldehyde compound and a thiol fluorescent probe. This reaction was demonstrated inside live cells by monitoring the aldehyde release in real time. In particular, the photocage can easily be functionalized with a mannose group so as to acquire the ability to target cancer cells.







Abstract
Photocages for protection and the controlled release of bioactive compounds have been widely investigated. However, the vast majority of these photocages employ the cleavage of single bonds and high&#8208;energy ultraviolet light. The construction of a photoactivation system that uses visible light to cleave unsaturated bonds still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a regioselective oxidative cleavage of C=C bonds from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photocage by illumination at 630&#8197;nm, resulting in a free aldehyde and a thiol fluorescent probe. This strategy was demonstrated in live HeLa cells, and the generated &#945;&#8208;formyl&#8208;BODIPY allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of aldehyde release in the cells. In particular, it is shown that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cells.

         <title>An Optimized Protocol for the Synthesis of Peptides Containing trans&#8208;cyclooctene and Bicyclononyne Dienophiles as Useful Multifunctional Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great advances in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles,  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click&#8208;functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull&#8208;down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Boron&#8208;Capped Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) (aam = anthranilamidato) derivatives are bench stable compounds that undergo remarkably selective reactions with Bu  3  SnH in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]  4  as the catalyst. The addition follows an unorthodox  trans  &#8208;selective course; in terms of regioselectivity, the Bu  3  Sn&#8208; unit is delivered&#160; to the C&#8208;atom adjacent to the boracyclic head group. This outcome is deemed to reflect a hydrogen bonding interaction between the protic &#8211;NH groups of the benzo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaborininone ring system and the polarized [Ru&#8722;Cl] bond in the loaded catalyst, which locks the substrate in place in a favorable orientation relative to the incoming reagent. The resulting isomerically (almost) pure  gem  &#8208;dimetalated building blocks are amenable to numerous downstream functionalizations; most remarkable is the ability to subject the &#8722;B(aam) moiety to Suzuki cross coupling without need for prior hydrolysis while keeping the adjacent Bu  3  Sn&#8208; group intact. Alternatively, the tin residue can be engaged in selective tin/halogen exchange without touching the boron entity; the fact that the two &#8208;NH entities of &#8211;B(aam) do not protonate organozinc reagents and hence do not interfere with Negishi reactions of the alkenyl halides thus formed is another virtue of this so far underutilized boracycle. Overall, the ruthenium catalyzed  trans  &#8208;hydrostannation of alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) derivatives opens a practical gateway to isomerically pure trisubstituted alkenes of many different substitution patterns by sequential functionalization of the 1&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;heterobimetallic adducts primarily formed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) type exciplex host employing a novel electron transport type (n&#8208;type) host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF type exciplex host based blue PhOLEDs showed high quantum efficiency above 20% with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) with 1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;Benzene Derivatives: Comparative Study and Use in Acid&#8208;Initiated C&#8208;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes are versatile reagents in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. In this work the effect of guanidino group modification on the PCET reactivity is evaluated (X=H or OMe) and the best performing two compounds applied in intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular aryl&#8208;aryl coupling and oxidative lactonization test reactions. In difference to related reactions with high&#8208;potential benzoquinones, only a small amount of acid is required to inititiate efficient reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox&#8208;active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high&#8208;potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4&#8208;bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities is evaluated.

     alt="Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) with 1,4-Bisguanidino-Benzene Derivatives: Comparative Study and Use in Acid-Initiated C-H Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1,4-Bisguanidino-benzenes&lt;/b&gt; are versatile reagents in proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. In this work the effect of guanidino group modification on the PCET reactivity is evaluated (X=H or OMe) and the best performing two compounds applied in intra- and inter-molecular aryl-aryl coupling and oxidative lactonization test reactions. In difference to related reactions with high-potential benzoquinones, only a small amount of acid is required to inititiate efficient reactions under mild conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox-active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high-potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4-bisguanidino-benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities is evaluated. The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized, and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum-chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed. Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl-aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;-4,4&#8217;&#8217;-tetramethoxy-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylcarbazole to give &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-diethyl-3,3&#8217;-bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2-[(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high-potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bioinspired Ether Cyclizations within a &#960;&#8208;Basic Capsule Compared to Autocatalysis on &#960;&#8208;Acidic Surfaces and Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Breaking the rules: Thanks to their broad responsiveness, epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclizations are identified as ideal for the direct comparison of supramolecular catalysts. The results suggest that &#960;&#8208;basic supramolecular capsule catalysts are as outstanding as pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts in breaking the Baldwin rules with high diastereoselectivity, particularly in cyclization cascades leading to bicyclic products. In clear contrast, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective co&#8208; and autocatalysis is confirmed to be unique for anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work out distinct characteristics is often difficult. Herein is reported how the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse inputs promises to fill this gap. Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;&#8208;basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts). The complementary cyclization on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective with regard to product&#8208;like co&#8208;catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylindolines and 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Indolines by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindolines was achieved by kinetic resolution with n&#8208;butyllithium and the chiral ligand sparteine followed by electrophilic quench. The recovered starting materials and the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products were isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies were used to determine the rate of Boc rotation.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;arylindolines (2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) was achieved by treatment of their N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) derivatives with n&#8208;butyllithium and sparteine in toluene at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C followed by electrophilic quench. The unreacted starting materials together with the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy showed that the rate of Boc rotation was fast (&#916;G&#8800;&#8776;57&#8197;kJ/mol at 195&#8197;K). This was corroborated by DFT studies and by in&#8197;situ ReactIR spectroscopy. The enantioenriched N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;arylindolines were converted to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products without significant loss in enantiopurity. Hence, either enantiomer of the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be obtained with high selectivity from the same enantiomer of the chiral ligand sparteine (one from the kinetic resolution and the other from subsequent lithiation&#8208;trapping of the recovered starting material). Secondary amine products were prepared by removing the Boc group with acid to provide a way to access highly enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl and 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolines.

         <title>Bipyridinium and Phenanthrolinium Dications for Metal&#8208;Free Hydrodefluorination: Distinctive Carbon&#8208;Based Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of novel organic dications as carbon&#8208;based Lewis acids is reported. The Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) of these bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium salts is exploited to initiate hydrodefluorination catalysis. Further, the participation of these species enables deuterodefluorination. Experimental and DFT analysis support the role of the dications in the initiation of silylium&#8208;mediated catalysis.







Abstract
The development of novel Lewis acids derived from bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium dications is reported. Calculations of Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) values indicate high carbon&#8208;based Lewis acidity at the ortho and para positions. This arises in part from extensive LUMO delocalization across the aromatic backbones. Species [C10H6R2N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [1&#8201;a]2+, Me [1&#8201;f]2+, tBu [1&#8201;g]2+), and [C12H4R4N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [2&#8201;a]2+, Me [2&#8201;b]2+) were prepared and evaluated for use in the initiation of hydrodefluorination (HDF) catalysis. Compound [2&#8201;a]2+ proved highly effective towards generating catalytically active silylium cations via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated hydride abstraction from silane. This enabled the HDF of a range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted sp3(C&#8722;F) bonds under mild conditions. The protocol was also adapted to effect the deuterodefluorination of cis&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3C6H9. The dications are shown to act as hydride acceptors with the isolation of neutral species C16H14N2 (3&#8201;a) and C16H10Me4N2 (3&#8201;b) and monocationic species [C14H13N2]+ ([4&#8201;a]+) and [C18H21N2]+ ([4&#8201;b]+). Experimental and computational data provide further support that the dications are initiators in the generation of silylium cations.

&lt;/b&gt; proved highly effective towards generating catalytically active silylium cations via Lewis acid-mediated hydride abstraction from silane. This enabled the HDF of a range of aryl- and alkyl- substituted sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(C&#8722;F) bonds under mild conditions. The protocol was also adapted to effect the deuterodefluorination of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-2,4,6-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;. The dications are shown to act as hydride acceptors with the isolation of neutral species C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) and monocationic species [C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;[4&#8201;a]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>NIR Emissive Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Complexes in the Solid State at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of NIR emitters based on earth&#8208;abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time&#8208;resolved emission and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600 &#177; 10 ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7 &#8729; 10&#8722;4 at room temperature. These are the first examples of Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that emit in the NIR II region.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Light&#8208;controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical activation is proposed as a general method for controlling the crystallization of sparingly soluble carbonates in space and time. The photogeneration of carbonate in an alkaline environment is achieved upon photo&#8208;decarboxylation of an organic precursor using a conventional 365 nm UV LED. Local irradiation was conducted focusing the LED light on a 300 mm radius spot on a closed glass crystallization cell. The precursor solution was optimized to avoid the precipitation of the photoreaction organic byproducts and prevent photoinduced pH changes to achieve the formation of calcium carbonate only in the corresponding irradiated area. The crystallization was monitored in real&#8208;time by time&#8208;lapse imaging. The method is also shown to work in gels. Similarly, it was also shown to photo&#8208;activate locally the formation of barium carbonate biomorphs. In the last case, the morphology of these biomimetic structures was tuned by changing the irradiation intensity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding in Barium Boryloxides, Siloxides, Phenoxides and Silazides: A Comparison with the Lighter Alkaline Earths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium and related alkaline&#8208;earth complexes bearing combinations of boryloxides, siloxides, phenoxides and amides have been structurally authenticated. Their structural patterns and bonding properties have been thoroughly investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Barium complexes ligated by bulky boryloxides [OBR2]&#8722; (where R=CH(SiMe3)2, 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2 or 2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3&#8208;C6H2), siloxide [OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;, and/or phenoxide [O&#8208;2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3]&#8722;, have been prepared. A diversity of coordination patterns is observed in the solid state for both homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes, with coordination numbers ranging between 2 and 4. The identity of the bridging ligand in heteroleptic dimers [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)]2 depends largely on the given pair of ligands X1 and X2. Experimentally, the propensity to fill the bridging position increases according to [OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]&#8722;&lt;[N(SiMe3)2]&#8722;&lt;[OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;&lt;[O(2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3)]&#8722;&lt;[OB(2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2)2]&#8722;. This trend is the overall expression of 3 properties: steric constraints, electronic density and &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donating capability of the negatively charged atom, and ability to generate Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;F, Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C(&#960;) or Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;H&#8722;C secondary interactions. The comparison of the structural motifs in the complexes [Ae{&#956;2&#8208;N(SiMe3)2}(OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]2 (Ae = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) suggest that these observations may be extended to all alkaline earths. DFT calculations highlight the largely prevailing ionic character of ligand&#8208;Ae bonding in all compounds. The ionic character of the Ae&#8208;ligand bond encourages bridging coordination, whereas the number of bridging ligands is controlled by steric factors. DFT computations also indicate that in [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)]2 heteroleptic dimers, ligand predilection for bridging vs. terminal positions is dictated by the ability to establish secondary interactions between the metals and the ligands.

         <title>Subphthalocyaninato Boron(III) Hydride: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time subphthalocyanine&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes have been prepared. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoro&#8208;subphthalocyanines using electrophiles. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.







Abstract
Subphthalocyanine (SubPc) chemistry has been limited so far by their high sensitivity toward strong nucleophiles. In particular, the substitution of the axial chlorine atom by a nucleophilic group in the case of less&#8208;reactive SubPcs, such as those bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing peripheral substituents, presents some limitations and requires harsh conditions. By taking advantage of the electrophilic character of DIBAL&#8208;H, it has been possible to prepare for the first time SubPc&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes. This hydride transfer requires using a typical carbonyl activator (trimethylsilyl triflate) and only one equivalent of aldehyde, affording SubPcs with an axial benzyloxy group in good yield. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoroSubPc, a paradigmatic SubPc derivative, by using electrophiles for the first time. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors with remarkable absorption in the visible range to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.

         <title>Chiral Perylene Bisimide Dyes by Interlocked Arene Substituents in the Bay Area</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motif of bay&#8208;tetraarylated perylene bisimides endows these molecules with chirality and rich conformational isomerism. These structural features are elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR. Optical spectroscopy including CD and CPL provide insights into their functional properties.







Abstract
A series of perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes bearing various aryl substituents in 1,6,7,12 bay positions has been synthesized by Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction. These molecules exhibit an exceptionally large and conformationally fixed twist angle of the PBI &#960;&#8208;core due to the high steric congestion imparted by the aryl substituents in bay positions. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of phenyl&#8208;, naphthyl&#8208; and pyrenyl&#8208;functionalized PBIs reveal interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motifs, leading to conformational chirality and the possibility for the isolation of enantiopure atropoisomers by semipreparative HPLC. The interlocked arrangement endows these molecules with substantial racemization barriers of about 120&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the tetraphenyl&#8208; and tetra&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, which is among the highest racemization barriers for axially chiral PBIs. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal the presence of a multitude of up to fourteen conformational isomers in solution that are interconverted via smaller activation barriers of about 65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The redox and optical properties of these core&#8208;twisted PBIs have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy and their respective atropo&#8208;enantiomers were further characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy.

         <title>The Binding Pocket at the Interface of Multimeric Telomere G&#8208;quadruplexes: Myth or Reality?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of naphthalenediimide (NDI) dyads at the interface of contiguous telomeric G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4) in hTel45 is revealed by synergically combining time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, induced circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry and further rationalized with modeling data. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data the approach used afforded new information that can help to rationalize the biological behavior of these ligands.







Abstract
Human telomeric DNA with hundreds of repeats of the 5&#8217;&#8208;TTAGGG&#8208;3&#8217; motif plays a crucial role in several biological processes. It folds into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures and features a pocket at the interface of two contiguous G4 blocks. Up to now no structural NMR and crystallographic data are available for ligands interacting with contiguous G4s. Naphthalene diimide monomers and dyads were investigated as ligands of a dimeric G4 of human telomeric DNA comparing the results with those of the model monomeric G4. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling were used to elucidate binding features. Ligand fluorescence lifetime and induced circular dichroism unveiled occupancy of the binding site at the interface. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the hypothesis as they remarkably change for the dyad complexes of the monomeric and dimeric telomeric G4. The bi&#8208;functional ligand structure of the dyads is a fundamental requisite for binding at the G4 interface as only the dyads engage in complexes with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry, lodging in the pocket at the interface and establishing multiple interactions with the DNA skeleton. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data, our study affords important proofs of binding at the interface pocket and clues on the role played by the ligand structure.

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dualistic behavior of the titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole, behaving as a heterodiene versus a hidden phosphinidene, has been theoretically predicted based on an NTR analysis. This spectacular feature has been proven chemically as well. Thus, it is able to participate in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions forming expected heterocycles, but it also serves as a 4e ligand, using two phosphorus electron lone pairs, bridging two transition metals (Au, Ag and Co).







Abstract
The titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole (1) (i.&#8201;e. ArP, where Ar=2&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H4, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) showed a spectacular reactivity behaving both as a reactive heterodiene in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions or as a hidden phosphinidene in the coordination toward selected transition metals (TMs). Thus, 1 reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes RC&#8801;CR (R=CO2Me, C5F4N) giving 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;iminonaphthalenes 2 and 3, that undergo hydrogen migration producing 1&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes 4 and 5. Compound 1 is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected N&#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;maleimides RN(C(O)CH)2 (R=Me, tBu, Ph) resulting in the addition products 7&#8211;9 with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to 1 is semi&#8208;reversible upon heating. By contrast, when 1 was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4e donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [&#956;&#8208;ArP(AuCl)2] (10), [(&#956;&#8208;ArP)4Ag4][X]4 (X=BF4 (11), OTf (12)) and [&#956;&#8208;ArP(Co2(CO)6)] (13). The structure and electron distribution of the starting material 1 as well as of other compounds were also studied from the theoretical point of view.

         <dc:description>

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed thiolation of aryl nitriles has been developed to access functionalized aryl thioethers. The ligand dcype (1,2&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane) as well as the base KOtBu (potassium tert&#8208;butoxide) are essential to achieve this transformation. This scalable and practical process involves both a C&#8722;C bond activation and a C&#8722;S bond formation. Furthermore, this reaction shows a high functional&#8208;group tolerance and enables the late&#8208;stage functionalization of important molecules.

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycle tricks: The evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin is reported. Highlights of the successful chiral&#8208;pool strategy are an intermolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi coupling to install the Z alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to construct the C2/C3 stereocenters, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle and the stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile, which furnished the maleic anhydride.







Abstract
Herein is given a full account of the evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Initial efforts were based on masking the reactive maleic anhydride moiety as a 3,4&#8208;substituted furan and on forming the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle in an intramolecular Conia&#8208;ene or Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction. Those strategies suffered from low yields and were jeopardized by a late&#8208;stage installation of the Z&#8208;alkene, as well as the stereocenters along the eastern periphery. These issues were addressed by employing a chiral&#8208;pool strategy that involved construction of the crucial stereocenters at C2, C3 and C8 at an early stage with installation of the maleic anhydride as late as possible. The successful approach featured an intermolecular NHK coupling to install the Z&#8208;alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to forge the stereocenters along the eastern periphery, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle, and a challenging stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile to furnish the maleic anhydride.

         <title>Acylhydrazone Subunits as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dropping your H&#8242;s: Two structurally different acylhydrazones containing imine (1&#8201;a) and ketimine (2&#8201;a) functions have been evaluated as proton cargo delivery subunits in the 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline platform. The tautomeric OH proton was delivered to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent (1&#8201;a) and hydrogen (2&#8201;a) bonding. The system is characterized by long stability in the switched state, thus enabling control of the bidirectional proton motion under different light energy.







Abstract
The reimagined concept of long&#8208;range tautomeric proton transfer using crane subunits is shown by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing a 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (7&#8208;OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone subunits attached to the 7&#8208;OHQ at the 8th position act as crane arms for delivering proton cargo to the quinoline nitrogen. Light&#8208;induced tautomerization to their keto forms leads to Z/E isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by the formation of covalent or hydrogen bonds. The axle&#8216;s being either an imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8722;CH3 group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathways. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tuneable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon the addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated; this results in E/Z configuration switching of the acylhydrazone subunits. This was proven by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>The Deuterated &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; Group: A Guide to Site&#8208;Selective Trideuteromethyl Incorporation and Labeling by Using CD3 Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;3 D&#8221; drug development: The deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group is attracting increased interest in pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we discuss the currently available methods for C&#8722;CD3 bond forming reactions and classify them according to the trideuteromethylation reagent. The mechanisms, scope and limitations of each method are considered in order to provide a guide for targeted trideutermethylation.







Abstract
In the field of medicinal chemistry, the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever&#8208;increasing attention. Site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylation of carbon atoms. In addition to CD3, the selective introduction of CD2H and CDH2 groups is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8722;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.

         <title>ChemBead Enabled High&#8208;Throughput Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Reveals a New, Complementary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) methods are central to modern medicinal chemistry. While many HTE approaches to C&#8208;N and Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  2  &#160;bonds are available, options for Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  3  &#160;bonds are limited. We report here how the adaptation of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl halides to HTE is enabled by AbbVie ChemBeads technology. Using this approach, we were able to quickly map out the reactivity space at a global level using a challenging array of 3 &#215; 222 micromolar reactions. The observed hit rate (56%) is competitive with other often&#8208;used HTE reactions and the results are scalable. A key to this level of success was the finding that bipyridine 6&#8208;carboxamidine (BpyCam), a ligand that had not previously been shown to be optimal in any reaction, is as general as the best&#8208;known ligands with complementary reactivity. Such &#8220;cryptic&#8221; catalysts may be common and modern HTE methods should facilitate the process of finding these catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent NOT logic is demonstrated by exploiting predissociation in a 1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazoline on its own and when grafted onto silica microparticles. Related &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazolines become proton&#8208;driven YES and NOT logic gates on the basis of fluorescent PET (photoinduced electron transfer) switches. Additional PASS 1 and YES + PASS 1 logic gates on silica are also demonstrated within the same family. Beside these small&#8208;molecule systems, a polymeric molecular thermometer based on a benzofurazan&#8208;derivatized N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide copolymer is attached to silica to produce temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent YES logic.</dc:description>

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives,  DHP  ,  DAP  , and  DBQD  , to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8211;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While  DHP  exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies,  DAP  and  DBQD  show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly sensitive fluorescent pH microsensors based on HPTS molecules immobilized on silica microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HPTS is a remarkably interesting pH sensitive dye that has been used for plenty of applications. Its high quantum yield and extremely sensitive ratiometric fluorescence against pH change makes it a very favorable for pH sensing applications and development of pH nano/microsensors. However, its strong negative charge and lack of easily modifiable functional groups makes it difficult to be used with charged substrates such as silica. This study reports a noncovalent HPTS immobilization methodology on silica microparticles that considers the retention of pH sensitivity as well as long term stability of the pH microsensors. The study emphasizes on importance of surface charge for governing the sensitivity of the immobilized HPTS dye molecules on silica microparticles. Importance of methodology of immobilization that preserves the sensitivity as well as stability of the microsensors is also assessed.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Level Chirality Transferring from Amino Acid Derivatives to CPL&#8208;Active Nanoparticles in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality at different levels is widely observed in nature, but the clue to connect them together, and the way how the chirality transfers among different levels are still obscure. Herein, we constructed a L&#8208;/D&#8208;lysine&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly system, in which two&#8208;step chirality transferring among three different levels was observed in aqueous solution. The chirality was originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives L&#8208;/D&#8208;PyLys hydrochlorides, and transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, with the aid of pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5, nanoparticles were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor up to &#177;0.001, arising from pyrene excimers arranged in the chiral manner. This multi&#8208;level chirality transferring not only provides a perspective to trace potential clue, and to pursue certain way by which the chirality transfers, but also offers a strategy to arise the controllable CPL emission in aqueous medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeting Ligands for the Universal Delivery of Small Molecules, Proteins and Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Paving the way for future targeted therapy with a variety of biological agents. Cell&#8208;penetrating mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands are capable of universal mitochondrial delivery of small molecules, proteins and nanomaterials. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. The successful delivery of doxorubicin (a well&#8208;known anticancer drug) showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis.







Abstract
Mitochondria are key organelles that perform vital cellular functions such as those related to cell survival and death. The targeted delivery of different types of cargos to mitochondria is a well&#8208;established strategy to study mitochondrial biology and diseases. Of the various existing mitochondrion&#8208;transporting vehicles, most suffer from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins, and nanomaterials). Herein, two new cell&#8208;penetrating, mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands (named MitoLigand) that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small&#8208;molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials are disclosed, as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well&#8208;known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondrion&#8208;targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.

Of the various existing mitochondrion-transporting vehicles, most suffer from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins, and nanomaterials). Herein, two new cell-penetrating, mitochondrion-targeting ligands (named Mito&lt;sup&gt;Ligand&lt;/sup&gt;) that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small-molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials are disclosed, as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well-known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondrion-targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Radicals and Anions of Siloles and Germoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of sterically hindered persistent sila&#8208; and germacyclopentadienyl radicals adds magnetic properties to these heterocyclic ring systems and sparks the idea of their possible application as building blocks for molecular magnets (pictured as red&#8208;blueish northern light). Support comes from the analysis of the EPR spectroscopic parameters and of their computed spin density &#8208; shown here for the silicon species &#8208; that indicate localization of the unpaired electron at the heteroatom. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Tumanskii, T. M&#252;ller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101415).

         <title>Molecular Gears: From Solution to Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving up a gear: Molecular gears have been explored since the early 1980s, but only in solution, which is intrinsically limited to intramolecular gearing motions. To propagate mechanical power from one molecule to the next, it is necessary to immobilize cogwheels in a dedicated spatial arrangement, such as in a train of gears on a surface. In the last years, some impressive progress has been made, leading to the correlated rotation of up to three molecules.







Abstract
This review highlights the major efforts devoted to the development of molecular gears over the past 40&#8197;years, from pioneering covalent bis&#8208;triptycyl systems undergoing intramolecular correlated rotation in solution, to the most recent examples of gearing systems anchored on a surface, which allow intermolecular transmission of mechanical power. Emphasis is laid on the different strategies devised progressively to control the architectures of molecular bevel and spur gears, as intramolecular systems in solution or intermolecular systems on surfaces, while aiming at increased efficiency, complexity and functionality.

         <title>Controlling Antibacterial Activity Exclusively with Visible Light: Introducing a Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzene Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a novel tetra&#8208; ortho &#8208;chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine A analogues using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn&#8208;off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light&#8208;activated compounds into their original trans form, offering an ideal platform for self&#8208;deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against Acinetobacter baumannii upon isomerisation. Exploration of their N &#8208; and C &#8208;termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic NiFe2O4 Nanoparticles Prepared via Non&#8208;aqueous Microwave&#8208;assisted Synthesis for Application in Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase&#8208;pure spinel&#8208;type magnetic nickel ferrite (NiFe  2  O  4  ) nanocrystals in the size range of 4 to 11 nm were successfully synthesized by a fast and energy saving microwave&#8208;assisted approach. Size and accessible surface areas can be tuned precisely by the reaction parameters. Our results highlight the correlation between size, inversion degree, and magnetic characteristics of NiFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of these parameters for a particular application without changing the elemental composition. Moreover, the application potential of the synthesized powders for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media was demonstrated, showing that a low degree of inversion is beneficial for the overall performance. The most active sample reaches an overpotential of 380 mV for water oxidation at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 38.8 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.7 V vs RHE, combined with a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Promoted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness&#8220;Ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; for Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths, the common strategy by reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept by &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen, which can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II. The yielded fluorophore (TTQP) with fused acceptor has shown enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in the nanoparticle formation, as compared to its NIR&#8208;I emissive counterpart (TTQ&#8208;DP) with the non&#8208;fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring&#8208;fusion action can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron&#8208;deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The yielded TTQP NPs thus allow sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, Evaluation and Structure of Allenic 1a,25&#8208; Dihydroxyvitamin D3&#160;Analogs with Locked Mobility at C&#8208;17</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system. However hypercalcemic effects limit their therapeutical uses and call for the development of tissue&#8208;selective new analogs. We have designed and synthesized the first examples of 1&#945;,25&#8208; dihydroxyvitamin D 3&#160; analogs bearing an allenic unit attached to the D ring to restrict the side&#8208;chain conformational mobility. The triene system was constructed by a Pd 0 &#8208;mediated cyclization/Suzuki&#8208; Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process in the presence of an allenic side chain. The allenic moiety was built through an orthoester&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of a propargylic alcohol. The biological activity and structure of (22 S )&#8208;1 a ,25&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;17,20&#8208;dien&#8208;24&#8208;homo&#8208;21&#8208;nor&#8208; vitamin D 3&#160; bound to binding domain of the vitamin D receptor, provide information concerning side&#8208;chain conformational requirements for biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Deoxyfluorinated N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine Analogues as 19F NMR Probes to Study Carbohydrate&#8208;Galectin Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Galectins are widely expressed galactose&#8208;binding lectins implied, for example, in immune regulation, metastatic spreading, and pathogen recognition.  N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LacNAc) and its oligomeric or glycosylated forms are natural ligands of galectins. To probe substrate specificity and binding mode of galectins, we synthesized a complete series of six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated analogues of LacNAc, in which each hydroxyl has been selectively replaced by fluorine while the anomeric position has been protected as methyl &#946;&#8208;glycoside. Initial evaluation of their binding to human galectin&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 by ELISA and  19F NMR  T2  &#8208;filter revealed that deoxyfluorination at C3, C4&#8242; and C6&#8242; completely abolished binding to galectin&#8208;1 but very weak binding to galectin&#8208;3 was still detectable. Moreover, deoxyfluorination of C2&#8242; caused an approximately 8&#8208;fold increase in the&#160;binding affinity towards galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was essentially not affected. Lipophilicity measurement revealed that deoxyfluorination at the Gal moiety affects log  P  very differently compared to deoxyfluorination at the GlcNAc moiety.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic vanadotungstates with tunable microporosity have potential interests in gas separation. The pore openings of the materials are in between the diameters of normal butane and isobutane, which causes the materials only adsorb normal butane. The breakthrough experiments show that the materials effectively separate normal butane from the normal butane and isobutane mixture even at high temperatures. The robust materials can be reused without loss of the separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC Effects on Reduction Dynamics in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high abundance, low toxicity and rich redox chemistry of iron has resulted in a surge of iron catalyzed organic transformations over the last two decades. Within this area, N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been widely utilized to achieve high yields across reactions including cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8208;H alkylation, amongst others. Central to the development of iron&#8208;NHC catalytic methods is the understanding of iron speciation and the propensity of these species to undergo reduction events, as low&#8208;valent iron species can be advantageous or undesirable from one system to the next. This study highlights the importance of the identity of the NHC on iron speciation upon reaction with EtMgBr, where reactions with SIMes and IMes NHCs were shown to undergo &#946; &#8208;hydride elimination more readily than those with SIPr and IPr NHCs. This insight is vital to developing new iron&#8208;NHC catalyzed transformations as understanding how to control this reduction by simply changing the NHC is central to improving the reactivity in iron&#8208;NHC catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven two&#8208;directional terthiazole&#8208;based switch: a combined experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terthiazoles with redox&#8208;active substituents like N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group and ferrocene have been synthesized and their photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;chromic behaviors investigated. The presence of two lateral N&#8208;methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring&#8208;closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene&#8208;based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700 mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox&#8208;active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability which, instead, got improved for the ring&#8208;opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate&#160;Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations: Synthetic Studies on Pimarane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyene cyclizations generate molecular complexity from a linear polyene in a single step. While methods to initiate these cyclizations have been continuously expanded and improved over the years, the majority of polyene substrates are still limited to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes. In this study, we took advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized bifunctional alkenes. The realization of a polyene tetracyclization of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether involving a transannular  endo  &#8208;termination step enabled the total synthesis of the tricyclic diterpenoid pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3  &#945;  &#8208;8  &#945;  &#8208;diol. The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic  nor  &#8208;diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation ordering and exsolution in copper&#8208;containing forms of the flexible zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M = H, Na) and their consequences for CO2 adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals Cu  2+  cations are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the  d8r  windows that control diffusion. Fully exchanged Cu&#8208;Rho remains in an open form upon dehydration, the  d8r  windows remain nearly circular and the occupancy of window sites is low, so that it adsorbs CO  2  rapidly at room temperature. Breakthrough tests with 10% CO  2  /40% CH  4  mixtures show that Cu  4.9  &#8208;Rho is able to produce pure methane, albeit with a relatively low capacity at this p  CO2  due to the weak interaction of CO  2  with Cu cations. This is in strong contrast with Na&#8208;Rho, where cations in narrow elliptical window sites enable CO  2  to be adsorbed with high selectivity and uptake but too slowly to enable the production of pure methane in similar breakthrough experiments. A series of Cu,Na&#8208;Rho materials was prepared to improve uptake and selectivity compared to Cu&#8208;Rho, and kinetics compared to Na&#8208;Rho. Remarkably, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho with &gt;2 Cu cations per unit cell exhibited exsolution, due to the preference of Na cations for narrow S8R sites in distorted Rho and of Cu cations for S6R sites in the centric, open form of Rho. The exsolved Cu,Na&#8208;Rho showed improved performance in CO  2  /CH  4  breakthrough tests, producing pure CH  4  with improved uptake and CO  2  /CH  4  selectivity compared to that of Cu  4.9  &#8208;Rho.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centres. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The corresponding adducts were obtained with moderate to high yields (67% ~ 98%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt; 20:1 dr, up to 99% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>(NH4)2V7O16 Micro&#8208;bricks as a Novel Anode for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;ion Battery with Good&#160;Cyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li  +  /Na  +  hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems, (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  and (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  , both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. The capacity retention of 78.61% after 500 cycles at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  has been demonstrated in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system while no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells have also been researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that the layered (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have once been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8211;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu  3+  , La  3+  , and Y  3+  , into polyvalent Ionic Liquids. In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM  3+  ][A  &#8211;  ]  3  . To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants  P  and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132}&#8208;cluster Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents non&#8208;covalently interact with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy, which is reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure we have synthesized a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules. By exploiting interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores we establish the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent and determine their enantiomeric excess by  1  H NMR. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of the class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.</dc:description>
