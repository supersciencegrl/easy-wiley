         <title>On the mediated electron transfer of immobilized galactose oxidase for biotechnological applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical synthesis offers advantages in terms of clean and highly selective transfor&#173;mations. Galactose oxidase (GalOx) is a remarkable enzyme with several applications in industrial conversions as it catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols. We investigate the wiring of GalOx with a redox polymer, enabling mediated electron transfer with the electrode surface. As a result of the electrochemical regeneration with minimal influence from O2, the formation of harmful H2O2 is prevented during enzymatic catalysis. The possibility for catalytic conversion with the introduced bioelectrode is shown with a parti&#173;cular emphasis on glycerol as model substrate. We also show that the enzyme can perform the over&#8208;oxidation of the substrate, lea&#173;ding not only to the corresponding aldehyde but also to the carboxylic acid by further conversion of the former.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded ethylenes composed of 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted carbon&#8208;carbon double (C=C) bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. As such, they are unique frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs). Various colored crystals of these FAEs, obtained using different solvents, correspond to multiple metastable conformations of the FAEs with various twist and fold angles of the C=C bond, as well as various dihedral angles of attached aryl units with respect to the C=C bond. The relationships between color and these parameters associated with conformational features around the C=C bond were elucidated using experimental and theoretical studies. Owing to the fact that they are separated by small energy barriers, the variously colored conformations in the FAE crystal change in response to various external stimuli, such as mechanical grinding, hydrostatic pressure and thermal heating.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral C&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of axially chiral compounds featuring a N&#8722;C stereogenic axis are presented and discussed, with an emphasis in catalytic asymmetric approaches. Diverse strategies and methodologies, based either on metal&#8208;catalyzed transformation or in organocatalytic activation, comprise not only the direct generation of the N&#8722;C axis but also desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic resolution and different types of chirality transfer.







Abstract
Molecules with restricted rotation around a single bond or atropisomers are found in a wide number of natural products and bioactive molecules as well as in chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis and smart materials. Although most of these compounds are biaryls and heterobiaryls displaying a C&#8722;C stereogenic axis, there is a growing interest in less common and more challenging axially chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers. This review offers an overview of the various methodologies available for their asymmetric synthesis. A brief introduction is initially given to contextualize these axially chiral skeletons, including a historical background and examples of natural products containing axially chiral C&#8722;N axes. The preparation of different families of C&#8722;N based atropisomers is then presented from anilides to chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring heterocycles. Special emphasis has been given to modern catalytic asymmetric strategies over the past decade for the synthesis of these chiral scaffolds. Applications of these methods to the preparation of natural products and biologically active molecules will be highlighted along the text.

         <title>Dissipative Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DDCvC) Based on the Transimination Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissipative dynamic libraries (DDLs) of imines are generated by addition of 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;chloro)phenylpropanoic acid employed as a chemical fuel to equilibrated dynamic libraries (DLs). At the addition of the fuel the initial composition of the library dictated by the thermodynamic equilibrium is perturbed and a transient, temporal controllable, out of equilibrium state is obtained, which reverts to the initial equilibrium when the fuel is exhausted.







Abstract
This work reports that the composition of a dynamic library (DL) of interconverting imines can be controlled over time in a dissipative fashion by the addition of an activated carboxylic acid used as a chemical fuel. When the fuel is added to the DL, which is initially under thermodynamic equilibrium, the composition of the mixture dramatically changes and a new, dissipative (out of equilibrium) state is reached that persists until fuel exhaustion. Thus, a transient dissipative dynamic library (DDL) is generated that, eventually, reverts back to the initial DL when the fuel is consumed, closing a DL&#8594;DDL&#8594;DL cycle. The larger the amount of added fuel, the longer the time spent by the system in the DDL state. The transimination reaction is shown to be an optimal candidate for the realization of a dissipative dynamic covalent chemistry (DDCvC).

         <title>Epigenetic Anti&#8208;Cancer Treatment With a Stabilized Carbocyclic Decitabine Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocyclic decitabine analogue cAzadC outperforms decitabine (5&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine, AzadC) in an acute myeloid leukemia cell line. AzadC is used in the clinic as an epigenetic drug against AML, but is very sensitive towards hydrolysis, which limits its application. cAzadC is substantially more stable than AzadC, but still inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and importantly, it induces significantly more deleterious DNA strand breaks than AzadC, making it a promising next&#8208;generation epigenetic drug.







Abstract
5&#8208;Aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (Decitabine, AzadC) is a nucleoside analogue, which is in clinical use to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Its mode of action is unusual because the compound is one of the few drugs that act at the epigenetic level of the genetic code. AzadC is incorporated as an antimetabolite into the genome and creates covalent, inhibitory links to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that methylate 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC). Consequently, AzadC treatment leads to a global loss of mdC, which presumably results in a reactivation of silenced genes, among them tumor suppressor and DNA damage response genes. Because AzadC suffers from severe instability, which limits its use in the clinic, a more sophisticated AzadC derivative would be highly valuable. Here, we report that a recently developed carbocyclic AzadC analogue (cAzadC) blocks DNMT1 in the AML cell line MOLM&#8208;13 as efficient as AzadC. Moreover, cAzadC has a surprisingly strong anti&#8208;proliferative effect and leads to a significantly higher number of double strand breaks compared to AzadC, while showing less off&#8208;target toxicity. These results show that cAzadC triggers more deleterious repair and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells than AzadC, which makes cAzadC a promising next generation epigenetic drug.

         <title>Module Assembly Strategy for Single&#8208;Cell Nucleic Acid Imaging at the Sub&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;cell imaging methods have unique advantages of maintaining the in&#8197;situ physiological state, morphology, and microenvironment. Herein, the design and application of single&#8208;cell imaging methods of nucleic acids at the sub&#8208;molecule level are summarized.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell imaging has unique advantages of maintaining the in&#8197;situ physiological state, morphology, and microenvironment, becoming a powerful tool to unravel the nature of intracellular nucleic acids. The analysis of nucleic acids unprecedentedly demands the sub&#8208;molecule details at segment or subunit, secondary structure and monomer levels, instead of just probing the sequence and the abundance of nucleic acids. Detection of nucleic acids at the sub&#8208;molecule level requires higher specificity and higher sensitivity, which becomes a new challenge in nucleic acid analysis. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in the design and the application of single&#8208;cell nucleic acid imaging methods at the sub&#8208;molecule level, including the visualization of RNA splicing variants, RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in an individual gene, single nucleotide variation of mitochondrial DNA, and RNA m6A methylation. Remarkably, we highlight the key strategy, &#8220;Module Assembly&#8221;, for high&#8208;performance molecular recognition and demonstrate the required improvements in future research.

         <title>Novel Thienyl DPP derivatives Functionalized with Terminal Electron&#8208;Acceptor Groups: Synthesis, Optical Properties and OFET Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel DPP derivatives characterized by terminal auxiliary acceptor groups have been reported. Because of their alternate donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure, the dyes are characterized by a low bandgap value up to 1.28&#8197;eV. The dyes, according to the different end functionalization, show a preferential unipolar charge transport behaviour with electron and hole mobility up, respectively, 4.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;2 and 2.3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s. Interestingly, in a blend configuration of the two best performant dyes, a well balanced ambipolar transport was observed.







Abstract
Three novel diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based small molecules have been synthesized and characterized in terms of their chemical&#8208;physical, electrochemical and electrical properties. All the molecules consist of a central DPP electron acceptor core symmetrically functionalized with donor bi&#8208;thienyl moieties and flanked in the terminal positions by three different auxiliary electron&#8208;acceptor groups. This kind of molecular structure, characterized by an alternation of electron acceptor and donor groups, was purposely designed to provide a significant absorption at the longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum: when analysed as thin films, in fact, the dyes absorb well over 800&#8197;nm and exhibit a narrow optical bandgap down to 1.28&#8197;eV. A detailed DFT analysis provides useful information on the electronic structure of the dyes and on the features of the main optical transitions. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been fabricated by depositing the DPP dyes as active layers from solution: the different end&#8208;functionalization of the dyes had an effect on the charge&#8208;transport properties with two of the dyes acting as n&#8208;type semiconductors (electron mobility up to 4.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s) and the third one as a p&#8208;type semiconductor (hole mobility up to 2.3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s). Interestingly, well&#8208;balanced ambipolar transistors were achieved by blending the most performant n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type dyes with hole and electron mobility in the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s

         <title>Partial Phosphorization: A Strategy to Improve Some Performance(s) of Thiolated Metal Nanoclusters Without Notable Reduction of Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial phosphorization strategy is introduced to improve the catalytic and PL performances of thiolated metal nanoclusters without notable reduction of stability, by illustrating the partial phosphorization of Au23(SC6H11)16 and its performances improvement. The transformation intermediates were captured and identified, throwing light on the understanding of the non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction.







Abstract
Thiolates endow metal nanoclusters with stability while sometimes inhibit the catalytic activity due to the strong M&#8722;S interaction (M: metal atom). To improve the catalytic activity and keep the stability to some extent, one strategy is the partial phosphorization of thiolated metal nanoclusters. This is demonstrated by successful partial phosphorization of Au23(SC6H11)16 and by revealing that the products Au22(SC6H11)14(PPh3)2 and Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4, with varied degree of phosphorization, both show excellent activity in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioanisole without notable reduction of stability. Furthermore, Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 exhibits better photoluminescence performance than the mother nanocluster Au23(SC6H11)16, indicating that partial phosphorization can also improve some other performance(s) except for the catalytic performance. The intermediates Au22&#8208;xCux(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 (x=1, 2) in the transformation from Au23(SC6H11)16 (Au22(SC6H11)14(PPh3)2) to Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 were captured and identified by mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which throws light on the understanding of the non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction.

         <title>Structures and Reactivities of Cocrystals Involving Diboronic Acids and Bipyridines: In Situ Linker Reaction and 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D Dimensionality Change via Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Photodimerization</title>

Chemical reactivity results in an in&#8208;situ linker modification and a switch of dimensionality with light involving cocrystals of diboronic acids and bipyridines.







Abstract
Cocrystallizations of diboronic acids [1,3&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (1,3&#8208;bdba), 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (1,4&#8208;bdba) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;biphenyldiboronic acid (4,4&#8217;&#8208;bphdba)] and bipyridines [1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpe) and 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpeta)] generated the hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cocrystals [(1,4&#8208;bdba)(bpe)2] (1), [(1,4&#8208;bdba)(bpeta)2] (2), [(1,3&#8208;bdba)(bpe)2(H2O)2] (3) and [(1,3&#8208;bdba)(bpeta)2(H2O)] (4), wherein 1,3&#8208;bdba involved hydrated assemblies. The linear extended 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bphdba exhibited the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [(4,4'&#8208;bphdba)(bpe)] (5) and [(4,4'&#8208;bphdba&#8208;me)(bpeta)] (6). For 6, a hemiester was generated by an in&#8208;situ linker transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In 1 and 3, the C=C bonds of the bpe molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of bpe into cyclobutane tpcb. The reactivity involving 1 occurred via 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.

     alt="Structures and Reactivities of Cocrystals Involving Diboronic Acids and Bipyridines: In Situ Linker Reaction and 1D-to-2D Dimensionality Change via Crystal-to-Crystal Photodimerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical reactivity&lt;/b&gt; results in an in-situ linker modification and a switch of dimensionality with light involving cocrystals of diboronic acids and bipyridines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocrystallizations of diboronic acids [1,3-benzenediboronic acid (1,3-bdba), 1,4-benzenediboronic acid (1,4-bdba) and 4,4&#8217;-biphenyldiboronic acid (4,4&#8217;-bphdba)] and bipyridines [1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (bpe) and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpeta)] generated the hydrogen-bonded 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cocrystals [(1,4-bdba)(bpe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (1), [(1,4-bdba)(bpeta)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (2), [(1,3-bdba)(bpe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (3) and [(1,3-bdba)(bpeta)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)] (4), wherein 1,3-bdba involved hydrated assemblies. The linear extended 4,4&#8217;-bphdba exhibited the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [(4,4'-bphdba)(bpe)] (5) and [(4,4'-bphdba-me)(bpeta)] (6). For 6, a hemiester was generated by an in-situ linker transformation. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, O&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen-bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In 1 and 3, the C=C bonds of the bpe molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of bpe into cyclobutane tpcb. The reactivity involving 1 occurred via 1D-to-2D single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Donor State Destabilisation &#8211; A New Route to Panchromatically Absorbing Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(I) and two chelating, anionic polymethine&#8208;type ligands form a novel type of photoactive cuprate. The ligands induce the destabilisation of the Cu(I)&#8208;based donor states and act themselves as acceptors. This leads to an unusually broad and intense absorption spectrum with metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer transitions from the visible to near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
The intense absorption of light to covering a large part of the visible spectrum is highly desirable for solar energy conversion schemes. To this end, we have developed novel anionic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes (cuprates), which feature intense, panchromatic light absorption properties throughout the visible spectrum and into the NIR region with extinction coefficients up to 28,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Steady&#8208;state absorption, (spectro)electrochemical and theoretical investigations reveal low energy (Vis to NIR) metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands, which are a consequence of destabilized copper&#8208;based donor states. These high&#8208;lying copper&#8208;based states are induced by the &#963;&#8208;donation of the chelating anionic ligands, which also feature low energy acceptor states. The optical properties are reflected in very low, copper&#8208;based oxidation potentials and three ligand&#8208;based reduction events. These electronic features reveal a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes.

         <title>A Nonaqueous Redox&#8208;Matched Flow Battery with Charge Storage in Insoluble Polymer Beads**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new redox&#8208;flow battery architecture, the redox&#8208;matched flow battery, wherein charge is stored on redox&#8208;active moieties covalently tethered to non&#8208;circulating, insoluble polymer beads and charge is transferred between the electrodes and the beads via soluble mediators with redox potentials matched to the active moieties on the beads. This enables high energy densities without crossover of bead&#8208;bound active material.







Abstract
We describe the nonaqueous redox&#8208;matched flow battery (RMFB), where charge is stored on redox&#8208;active moieties covalently tethered to non&#8208;circulating, insoluble polymer beads and charge is transferred between the electrodes and the beads via soluble mediators with redox potentials matched to the active moieties on the beads. The RMFB reported herein uses ferrocene and viologen derivatives bound to crosslinked polystyrene beads. Charge storage in the beads leads to a high (approximately 1.0&#8211;1.7&#8201;M) effective concentration of active material in the reservoirs while preventing crossover of that material. The relatively low concentration of soluble mediators (15&#8197;mM) eliminates the need for high&#8208;solubility molecules to create high energy density batteries. Nernstian redox exchange between the beads and redox&#8208;matched mediators was fast relative to the cycle time of the RMFB. This approach is generalizable to many different redox&#8208;active moieties via attachment to the versatile Merrifield resin.

The two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited fluorophores exhibiting large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections and high fluorescence efficiency are highly pursued. Herein, two 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;diboryl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithienyls are reported which are characterized by a quadrupolar structure and display good fluorescence efficiency and large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections reaching 473&#8197;GM.







Abstract
The quest for fluorophores exhibiting large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections and high fluorescence efficiency is an important topic. Two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithienyl derivatives are disclosed which contain two N,N&#8208;disubstituted amino and two dimesitylboryl groups at 3,3&#8217;&#8208; and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;positions, respectively. Despite the great steric effect of amino groups, the bithienyl skeleton still adopts a coplanar geometry. Herein, they are characterized by a quadrupolar structure and display good fluorescence efficiency and large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections up to 473&#8197;GM.

         <title>Dynamic control of microbial movement by photoswitchable ATP antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonsits showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an  in vitro  dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the  trans  and  cis  photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  . We found that the  trans  and  cis  isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with A Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) could suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8208;NHC) with Fe&#8208;N  x  sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1C, the specific capacity is 1079 mA h g  &#8208;1  and maintains a low loss of 0.076% per cycle within 500 cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4C, a high capacity of 824 mA h g  &#8208;1  is still achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generalizing the aromatic &#948;&#8208;amino acid foldamer helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility,  e.g.  due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and  1  H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature,  i.e.  the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp  3  centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Anthracene&#8208;Centered Large PAH Diimides and Conjugated Polymers**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzannulation reaction followed by intramolecular arylation has been applied to the synthesis of a PAH diimide (BFDI) featuring a central anthracene moiety. When BFDI is coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two polymers with significantly red&#8208;shifted, broad absorptions are prepared, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI and charge&#8208;transfer characteristic of the polymer backbones.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures with suitable electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are useful building blocks for developing optical and electron&#8208;transporting materials. Here, we report the application of a double benzannulation process to the syntheses of PAH diimides with enlarged &#960;&#8208;frameworks featuring a central anthracene moiety. The preparations are realized by copper&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of ethynyl&#8208;substituted aromatic dicarboximide to 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)terephthalaldehyde, followed by intramolecular photocyclization or direct arylation via Heck cross coupling. A central symmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;k:4,5&#8208;k&#8242;]&#8208;bis(fluoranthene)&#8208;3,4,12,13&#8208;tetracarboxyl diimide (BFDI) is acquired, with the single crystal structure revealing its completely planar polycyclic skeleton. Such a shape&#8208;persistent PAH expectedly exhibits a tendency to stack face&#8208;to&#8208;face and forms J&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, BFDI can be difunctionalized site&#8208;selectively at the reactive 9 and 10 positions of the anthracene unit and then applied to prepare conjugated polymers. When coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two polymers with significantly broadened absorption bands extended to the near&#8208;infrared regime are obtained, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI unit.

         <title>Stereodivergent Desymmetrization of Simple Dicarboxylates via Branch&#8208;Selective Pd/Cu Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd/Cu catalyzed stereodivergent desymmetrization of unsubstituted allylic dicarboxylates was developed and the corresponding products could be generated in excellent yields with good stereoselectivity. Notably, the reaction favored branch&#8208;selectivity. Large scale experiment and the transformations of products indicated the potential utility of this reaction. In addition, computational studies revealed that the greater electrophilicity of branch carbon in the &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd intermediate and the weak noncovalent interactions among the substrates and the catalysts contributed to the high branch&#8208;selectivity of this reaction.







Abstract
Asymmetric desymmetrization has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for building stereocenters in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a Pd/Cu catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization reaction with a simple geminal dicarboxylate is reported. A wide scope of imino esters bearing an aryl or heteroaromatic group were compatible with this bimetallic catalytic system. The reactions proceeded smoothly, giving the desired products in good yields with high to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 branched:linear, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Notably, the reaction favored branched selectivity, which is unusual for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. In addition, the standard product could be easily transformed to other valuable molecules such as chiral allylic alcohols, carbamates, and organic boron compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explain the origin of the branched selectivity.

         <title>Promoting Proton Transfer and Stabilizing Intermediates in Catalytic Water Oxidation via Hydrophobic Outer Sphere Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outer coordination sphere engineering: A series of pocket&#8208;shaped catalysts with well&#8208;defined outer coordination environments were synthesized and characterized, showing that the hydrophobic outer coordination sphere could stabilize high&#8208;valent intermediates and promote proton transfer during water oxidation catalysis. The introduction of hydrophobic outer&#8208;sphere interactions is therefore envisaged as an effective strategy to tune other related proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions.







Abstract
The outer coordination sphere of metalloenzyme often plays an important role in its high catalytic activity, however, this principle is rarely considered in the design of man&#8208;made molecular catalysts. Herein, four Ru&#8208;bda (bda=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) based molecular water oxidation catalysts with well&#8208;defined outer spheres are designed and synthesized. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the hydrophobic environment around the Ru center could lead to thermodynamic stabilization of the high&#8208;valent intermediates and kinetic acceleration of the proton transfer process during catalytic water oxidation. By this outer sphere stabilization, a 6&#8208;fold rate increase for water oxidation catalysis has been achieved.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Unique Platforms to Gain Insight of &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions for the Removal of Organic Dyes from Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework, with functional channels decorated with &#8722;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, does not only exhibit outstanding capture properties for organic dyes but also establishes that sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions play a prominent role with the help of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The combination of high crystallinity and rich host&#8208;guest chemistry in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have situated them in an advantageous position, with respect to traditional porous materials, to gain insight on specific weak noncovalent supramolecular interactions. In particular, sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions are known to play a key role in the biological activity of living beings as well as on relevant molecular recognitions processes. However, so far, they have been barely explored. Here, we describe both how the combination of the intrinsic features of MOFs, especially the possibility of using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXRD), can be an extremely valuable tool to gain insight on sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions, and how their rational exploitation can be enormously useful in the efficient removal of harmful organic molecules from aquatic ecosystems. Thus, we have used a MOF, prepared from the amino acid L&#8208;methionine and possessing channels decorated with &#8722;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, to remove a family of organic dyes at very low concentrations (10&#8197;ppm) from water. This MOF is able to efficiently capture the four dyes in a very fast manner, reaching within five minutes nearly the maximum removal. Remarkably, the crystal structure of the different organic dyes within MOFs channels could be determined by SCXRD. This has enabled us to directly visualize the important role sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions play on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, representing one of the first studies on the rational exploitation of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions for water remediation.

         <title>Relativistic Spin&#8211;Orbit Electronegativity and the Chemical Bond Between a Heavy Atom and a Light Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relativistic spin&#8211;orbit electronegativity and the periodic table. The relativistic spin&#8211;orbit coupling associated with the presence of a heavy atom in a molecule is shown to have a significant effect on the electron charge density, HA&#8722;LA bond distance, and NMR shielding at a neighboring light atom. This phenomenon is transparently interpreted across the periodic table of elements by the SO&#8208;induced rearrangement of the electron density and electronegativity of the HA.







Abstract
Relativistic effects are known to alter the chemical bonds and spectroscopic properties of heavy&#8208;element compounds. In this work, we introduce the concept of spin&#8211;orbit (SO) electronegativity of a heavy atom, as reflected by an SO&#8208;induced change in the interatomic distance between the heavy atom (HA) and a neighboring light atom (LA). We provide a transparent interpretation of these SO effects by using the concept of spin&#8211;orbit electron deformation density (SO&#8208;EDD). Spin&#8211;orbit coupling at the HA induces rearrangement of the electron density for the scalar&#8208;relativistically optimized geometry that, in turn, exerts a new force on the LA. The resulting expansion or contraction of the HA&#8722;LA bond depends on the nature and electron configuration of the HA. In addition, we quantify the change in atomic electronegativity induced by SO coupling for a series of hydrides, thereby complementing the SO&#8208;EDD picture. The trends in the SO&#8208;induced electronegativity and the HA&#8722;LA bond length across the periodic table of elements are demonstrated and interpreted, and also linked, intuitively, with the SO&#8208;induced NMR shielding at the LA.

         <title>The Varied Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity of the Germylene Phosphaketene (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO reacts with E(C6F5)3 (E=B, Al) and with alkynes or olefins, acting as either an intramolecular or intermolecular FLP controlled by the nature of electrophiles and nucleophiles generated in solution as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.







Abstract
The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO 1 is shown to react with the Lewis acids (E(C6F5)3 E=B, Al). Nonetheless, 1 participates in FLP chemistry with electron deficient alkynes or olefins, acting as an intramolecular FLP. In contrast, in the presence of B(C6F5)3 and an electron rich alkyne, 1 behaves as Ge&#8208;based nucleophile to effect intermolecular FLP addition to the alkyne. This reactivity demonstrates that the reaction pathway is controlled by the nature of the electrophile and nucleophile generated in solution, as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probe for Detecting Trimethylamine Based on Intermolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of small organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore molecule (ZS&#8208;1010) was developed as a NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probe for trimethylamine (TMA) detection based on intermolecular charge transfer. This is the first example of TMA fluorescent probe in the NIR&#8208;II window showing deep penetration, fast response speed, high selectivity and pH stability.







Abstract
A new kind of small organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore molecule (ZS&#8208;1010) based on intermolecular charge transfer was developed as a NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probe for trimethylamine (TMA) detection, which is important for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and diabetes. ZS&#8208;1010 has a strong push&#8211;pull electron system composed of electron donor unit and electron acceptor unit, exhibiting strong absorption and emission in the NIR&#8208;II region. When mixed with TMA which possesses strong electron&#8208;donating characteristics, the push&#8211;pull system of ZS&#8208;1010 will be affected along with the dipole moment change, leading to the quenching of fluorescence. This is the first example of TMA fluorescent probe in the NIR&#8208;II window showing deep penetration, fast response speed, high selectivity and pH stability.

         <title>Metalloimmunotherapy with Rhodium and Ruthenium Complexes: Targeting Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium and ruthenium complexes are revealed as promising new agents for metalloimmunotherapy. Leads were identified that kill immunosuppressive M2 macrophages selectively, sensitize macrophage/cancer cell 3D co&#8208;culture spheroids to a chemotherapeutic drug and increase cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a key event in immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) suppress the cancer immune response and are a key target for immunotherapy. The effects of ruthenium and rhodium complexes on TAMs have not been well characterized. To address this gap in the field, a panel of 22 dirhodium and ruthenium complexes were screened against three subtypes of macrophages, triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and normal breast tissue cells. Experiments were carried out in 2D and biomimetic 3D co&#8208;culture experiments with and without irradiation with blue light. Leads were identified with cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific toxicity toward macrophage subtypes, cancer cells, or both. Experiments with 3D spheroids revealed complexes that sensitized the tumor models to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a known facilitator of immunogenic cell death (ICD), was increased upon treatment, along with a concomitant reduction in the M2&#8208;subtype classifier arginase. Our findings lay a strong foundation for the future development of ruthenium&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;based chemotherapies targeting TAMs.

         <title>Design and preparation of electrocatalysts by electrodeposition for CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ), the conversion and utilization of CO  2  have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO  2  RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO  2  RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their application in CO  2  RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;induced dual phosphorescence from (o&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)borane at room temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly efficient purely organic phosphors at room temperature remains a challenge because of fast non&#8208;radiative processes and slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The majority of them emit only single component phosphorescence. Herein, we have prepared 3 isomers (  o  ,  m  ,  p  &#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)boranes. Among the 3 isomers (  o  &#8208;,  m  &#8208; and  p  &#8208;  BrTAB  ) synthesized, the  ortho  &#8208;one is the only one which shows dual phosphorescence, with a short lifetime of 0.8 ms and a long lifetime of 234 ms in the crystalline state at room temperature. Based on theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis of  o  &#8208;  BrTAB  ,  the short lifetime component is ascribed to the T  1  M  state of the monomer which emits the higher energy phosphorescence. The long&#8208;lived, lower energy phosphorescence emission is attributed to the T  1  A  state of an aggregate, with multiple intermolecular interactions existing in crystalline  o  &#8208;  BrTAB  inhibiting nonradiative decay and stabilizing the triplet states efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Topologically Interlocked Minicircles as Probes of DNA Topology and DNA&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the frame: Topologically interlocked minicircle DNA rotaxanes and catenanes inside DNA origami frames have been designed and synthesized. With these assemblies, the DNA topology and its influence on DNA&#8211;protein interactions were examined by enzymatic restriction. Facile cleavage by restriction enzymes was observed for flexible linear duplexes, whereas free or interlocked minicircles were reluctant to split, thus indicating the role of the topology. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Morii et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200108).

A combined experimental and computational study highlights the crucial role played by intermolecular non&#8208;covalent weak&#8208;interactions in the conformer selection, the solid&#8208;state organization and the photophysical properties observed in a series of phases of a CuI8PdII2 multimetallic assembly. Rationalization of the structure/properties relationships allows understanding their mechanical and thermal stimuli&#8208;sensitive responses.







Abstract
A new highly solid&#8208;state luminescent phase of a previously reported weakly luminescent CuI8PdII1 dicationic assembly is reported revealing the high geometrical versatility of this moiety that importantly alters its luminescent properties. This very minor new species Bc is based on a different conformer scaffold than the one encountered in the previously reported Bo form and, essentially differs from Bo by displaying shorter CuI&#8208;CuI intermetallic distances. DFT calculations allow concluding that the predominance in the solid&#8208;state of the weakly luminescent and less stable Bo phase is due to the extra stability induced by a larger number of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;CH interactions in its crystalline packing and not by the intrinsic stability of the CuI8PdII1 dicationic moiety. Calculations also revealed that a more stable conformation Bcalc is expected in vacuum, which bears a different distribution of CuI&#8208;CuI intermetallic distances than the dications in Bo and Bc phases. Taking into account that the geometrical alterations are associated to drastic changes of luminescence properties, this confer to the CuI8PdII1 assembly high potentiality as stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescent materials. Indeed, by applying mechanical or thermal stress to samples of Bo phase, new phases Bg and Bm, respectively, were obtained. Alterations of the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of these new species compared to those recorded for Bo are reported together with a combined experimental and computed study of the structures/properties relationships observed in these phases.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Heterogeneous Thermocatalysis Caused by Catalyst Wettability Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis caused by catalyst wettability regulation are summarized, including the introduction of hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hybrid hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, and superaerophilicity. Relevant reactions are classified and described in detail according to the reason for the performance improvement. Studies of utilizing superaerophilicity to improve heterogeneous thermocatalytic performance have been included in the system for the first time, forming a comparatively comprehensive review in this field as yet.







Abstract
Catalyst wettability regulation has emerged as an attractive approach for high catalytic performance for the past few years. By introducing appropriate wettability, the molecule diffusion of reactants and products can be enhanced, leading to high activity. Besides this, undesired molecules are isolated for high selectivity of target products and long&#8208;term stability of catalyst. Herein, we summarize wettability&#8208;induced high&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis in recent years, including hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hybrid hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, and superaerophilicity. Relevant reactions are further classified and described according to the reason for the performance improvement. It should be pointed out that studies of utilizing superaerophilicity to improve heterogeneous thermocatalytic performance have been included for the first time, so this is a comparatively comprehensive review in this field as yet.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#946;&#8208;Fused BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly versatile synthetic route to symmetric and asymmetric &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY molecules possessing a butterfly shape is described. These dyes exhibit very attractive optical properties such as panchromatic absorption and effective emission in the NIR region.







Abstract
Here, we report the synthesis and properties of heterosubtituted &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY fluorophores. The compounds were obtained in good yields by sequential and selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahalo&#8208;BODIPY, allowing the introduction of different substituents at the 3,5 and 2,6 positions of the BODIPY ring. The final fused compounds were synthesized using oxidative cyclisation with ferrous chloride. The fully fused compounds show a strong bathochromically shifted emission along with a hyperchromic shift of the absorption maxima. The fluorescence quantum yields remain relatively large for compounds emitting in this wavelength range. Computational studies have been carried out to fully understand the photophysical behaviour of these dyes.

         <title>Polycations Stabilised by Borosulfates: [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and the One&#8208;Dimensional Metal [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3)</title>

A different dimension: The borosulfates [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) were obtained through the reaction of AuCl3 with and in SO3. The [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; anions serve as charge compensation for cluster&#8208;like and chain&#8208;like polycations. The latter are found in [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) and resemble one&#8208;dimensional metals according to DFT&#8208;based quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. This is confirmed experimentally by polarisation microscopy.







Abstract
(SO4)&#8208;rich silicate analogue borosulfates are able to stabilise cationic cluster&#8208;like and chain&#8208;like aggregates. Single crystals of [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) were obtained by solvothermal reaction with SO3, and the electronic properties were investigated by means of density functional theory&#8211;based calculations. [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] exhibits a cluster&#8208;like cation, and the cationic gold&#8208;chloride strands in [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) are found to resemble one&#8208;dimensional metallic wires. This is confirmed by polarisation microscopy.

         <title>Probing the Potential of Hitherto Unexplored Base&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes in Dinitrogen Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite decades of intense research, metal&#8208;free binding of N2 is still a tantalizing goal. We have computationally explored di&#8208;coordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes as candidates for N2 capture. Besides identifying key borylene&#8211;N2 adducts with low activation barriers, we reveal that the reaction exergonicity is linearly dependent on the natural charge at boron. These findings pave the way for the design of boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications in small&#8208;molecule activation. More information can be found in the Research Article by F.

     alt="Probing the Potential of Hitherto Unexplored Base-Stabilized Borylenes in Dinitrogen Binding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Despite decades of intense research&lt;/b&gt;, metal-free binding of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is still a tantalizing goal. We have computationally explored di-coordinate, singly base-stabilized borylenes as candidates for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. Besides identifying key borylene&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adducts with low activation barriers, we reveal that the reaction exergonicity is linearly dependent on the natural charge at boron. These findings pave the way for the design of boron-based compounds with potential applications in small-molecule activation. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fantuzzi, H. Braunschweig, A.&#8197;K. Phukan et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202104123"&gt;10.1002/chem.202104123&lt;/a&gt;). Cover designed by F.F.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a leap toward anion separation that uses only energy input for binding and release cycles, we report herein a new class of photoswitchable anion receptors featuring a diiminoguanidinium functionality that displays more than five orders of magnitude switched&#8208;off change in binding strength towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion, upon photoirradiation with UV light. E , E &#8208;2pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium cation, synthesized as the triflate salt, binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in DMSO&#8208; d 6 owing to its bidentate guanidinium hydrogen bonding that can chelate the O&#8211;S&#8211;O edge of sulfate. The anion&#8208;binding site is essentially shut off upon photoisomerization to the Z , Z isomer, by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, as supported by anion&#8208;binding titrations, theoretical calculations, and X&#8208;ray structural analysis. This approach will allow the development of advanced anion separation cycles that use only energy input and generate no chemical waste, and thus address challenging chemical separation problems in a more sustainable way.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of an Asymmetric Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present that an asymmetric reaction can be implemented and refined in a helical cavity of aromatic oligoamide sequences. These sequences bearing a chiral inducer can fold into helical structures with absolute control of the helical sense, whereby a ketone substrate covalently linked in the cavity can be asymmetrically reduced to diastereomers. The diastereoselectivity of the reduction reaction is highly dependent on the shielding efficiency of the helical cavity. Iterative modifications of the sequence, such as addition and replacement of monomers, can fine&#8208;tune the cavity for realizing the asymmetric reaction, thereby progressive increasing the diastereomeric excess up to 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interaction, but there are only very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands  L1  and  L2  with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Coordination of  L1  and  L2  with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;1  ) and two&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;2  ) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic  cobalt(II) ions  and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of metal&#8208;radical approach toward magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Gold&#8208;Framed Palladium Nanocubes for Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present an unprecedented environmentally benign methodology for the covalent functionalization (arylation) of  rGO  nanosheets with arylazo sulfones. A variety of tagged aryl units were conveniently accommodated at the  rGO  surface via visible&#8208;light irradiation of suspensions of carbon nanostructured materials in aqueous media. Mild reaction conditions, absence of photosensitizers, functional group tolerance and high atomic fractions (XPS analysis) represent some of the salient features characterizing the present methodology.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold complexes: the putative intermediate in Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes does not protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.</dc:description>

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH 2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH 2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;* C=S and &#960;* C=Se orbitals, than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;* C=O . The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen n p and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8211;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, not the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide&#8217;s hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Terphenyl Supported Dioxophosphorane Dimer: the Light Congener of Lawesson&#8217;s and Woollins&#8217; Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

[Ar  iPr4  PO  2  ]  2  was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy; it contains a 4&#8208;membered P&#8208;O&#8208;P&#8208;O ring and is the isostructural oxygen analogue of Lawesson&#8217;s and Woollins&#8217; reagents. The dimeric structure of [Ar  iPr4  PO  2  ]  2  was found to persist in solution through VT&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and DOSY, supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Anomeric stereoauxiliary cleavage of the C&#8208;N bond of D&#8208;glucosamine for the preparation of imidazo[1,5&#8208;&#945;]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds of alkyl primary amines in sustainable compounds of biomass  via  a metal&#8208;free pathway and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines are still highly challenging. Despite tremendous progress in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines over the past decade, many of them can still not be efficiently prepared. Herein, we report an anomeric stereoauxiliary approach for the synthesis of a wide range of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines after cleaving the C&#8722;N bond of D&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of D&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage through a seven&#8208;membered ring transition state. Using this novel method, a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives (more than 80 examples) were synthesized from pyridine ketones (including para&#8208;dipyridine ketone) and aldehydes (including para&#8208;dialdehyde). Moreover, imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines derivatives containing diverse important deuterated C(sp  2  )&#8722;H and C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds were also efficiently achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R = NH  2  ) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R = NO  2  ) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L  1  )(L  2  )]  n  (  1  ) and [Zn(L  1  )(L  3  )]  n  (  2  ) [L  1  = 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole, L  2  = Pbim 5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L  3  = 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of  1  revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954; = 65.5 at 1 kHz), while compound  2  displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954; = 110.3 at 1 kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH  2  and NO  2  substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO  2  and NH  2  but the effect is more pronounced. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report two new Fe  III  complexes  [L  1  Fe  III  (H  2  O)](OTf)  2  and  [L  2  Fe  III  (OTf)]  , obtained by replacing pyridines by phenolates in a known non&#8208;heme aminopyridine iron complex. While the original, starting aminopyridine  [(L  5  2  )Fe  II  (MeCN)](PF  6  )  complex is stable in air, the potentials of the new Fe  III/II  couples decrease to the point that  [L  2  Fe  II  ]  spontaneously reduces O  2  to superoxide. We used it as an O  2  activator in an electrochemical setup, as its presence allows to generate superoxide at a much more accessible potential (&gt; 500 mV gain). Our aim was to achieve substrate oxidation via the reductive activation of O  2  . While L  2  Fe  III  (OTf) proved to be a good O  2  activator but a poor oxidation system, its association with another complex (TPEN)Fe  II  (PF  6  )  2  generates a complementary tandem couple for electro&#8208;assisted oxidation of substrates, working at a very accessible potential: upon reduction, L  2  Fe  III  (OTf) activates O  2  to superoxide and transfers it to (TPEN)Fe  II  (PF  6  )  2  leading  in fine  to the oxidation of thioanisole.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Intramolecular P/Al&#8208;Based Frustrated Lewis Pairs via Aluminum&#8208;Tin&#8208;Exchange and their Reactivity toward CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exchange of the players stannane and alane provides a viable route to intramolecular FLPs with large separations between Lewis acidic aluminum und Lewis basic phosphane functions. Neutral molecules occupy the space between the two moieties and are easily displaced by approaching substrates like CO2, which is spanned in the reaction pocket &#8208; particularly strongly if the residues at the Al centers correspond to C6F5.







Abstract
Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) composed of acidic alane and basic phosphane functions, separated by a xanthene linker, can be prepared through the corresponding Me3Sn derivative and methyl aluminum compounds with elimination of Me4Sn. This way MeClAl&#8208;, Cl2Al&#8208; and (C6F5)2Al&#8208; moieties could be introduced and the resulting FLPs are stabilized by a further equivalent of the alane precursors. In contact with the FLPs CO2 is bound via the C atom at the phosphane functions and the two O atoms at the Al centers. The residues at the latter determine the binding strength. Hence, in case of MeClAl CO2 capture occurs at higher pressure and under ambient conditions CO2 is released again, while for Cl2Al and (C6F5)2Al CO2 binding becomes irreversible. The results of DFT calculations rationalize these findings by the high thermodynamic stabilization in case of more electronegative residues, which concomitantly lead to higher barriers, and in case of (C6F5)2Al further stabilization is achieved through a low reorganization energy.

         <title>DoE&#8208;Driven Development of an Organocatalytic Enantioselective Addition of Acetaldehyde to Nitrostyrenes in Water**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's in the design: Moving from organic solvents to water is not always an easy task, especially when a lot of variables need to be screened. The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed Michael addition of acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes in water was developed by using a rational approach, via chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation. This way it was possible to screen 9 different parameters, their interaction with each other, and the full chemical space, with minimum experiments in an efficient manner.







Abstract
The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed addition of masked acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes via a rational approach helped to move away from the use of chloroform. The presented research allows the use of water as a reaction medium, therefore improving the industrial relevance of a protocol to access very important pharmaceutical intermediates. Critical to the success is the use of chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation during the development of the presented new synthetic approach, which allows to investigate the chemical space in a rational way.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Formed Stable PbI2/NiOx Interface with Increased Ni3+ Centers for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;formed PbI2/NiOx interface to stabilize the Ni3+&#8208;rich NiOx hole transport layers is proposed. Combined with ultraviolet ozone treatment and sequential deposition, the density of Ni3+ centers was greatly increased and could be stabilized by the PbI2 interface. These merits contribute coordinately to the better charge transfer capability and the reduction of charge recombination across the PbI2/NiOx interface.







Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is a promising hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite photovoltaics owing to its chemical stability and low cost. However, most NiOx based solar cells deliver relatively weak performance because of its insufficient electrical property and interfacial contact. In this work, a self&#8208;formed PbI2/NiOx interface was developed to stabilize the Ni3+ centers, which was beneficial for electrical transport and band alignment in perovskite solar cells. Combined with ultraviolet ozone treatment (UVO) and sequential deposition, the density of Ni3+ centers was greatly increased and could be stabilized by the PbI2 interface. These merits contributed coordinately to the fast hole extraction and low energy loss across the PbI2/NiOx interface, yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 19&#8201;%.

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of the organic building units of MOFs towards selective detection of a targeted metal cation (Fe3+) has been demonstrated by systematic screening by varying the number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). All three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present a quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water; however, only UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas the emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;K. Ghosh et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104175).

Temperature monitoring in&#8197;vivo plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and disease diagnosis and therapy. Herein, a general overview of the development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite thermometers as microscopic thermometers are discussed, including their thermometric mechanisms and strategies, materials designs and potential applications for temperature detection in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Temperature monitoring in&#8197;vivo plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes in&#8197;vivo allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for in&#8197;vivo temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body. The perspectives of these lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite thermometers for the optimization of temperature monitoring performance and potential future development are also discussed.

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Selective C&#8722;H Azidation of Proline&#8208;Containing Peptides: a Platform for Late&#8208;Stage Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective C&#8722;H azidation of up to 6 amino acids long proline&#8208;containing peptides is reported. In each example, the N&#8208;terminal residue was selectively functionalized even in presence of amino acids bearing tertiary aliphatic, benzylic and &#945; to heteroatoms C&#8722;H bonds. The azidated products were used in cycloaddition reactions and as masked imines for new C&#8722;C bond formations, allowing an easy access to diversified peptide scaffolds.







Abstract
A methodology for the C&#8722;H azidation of N&#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing peptides was developed employing only commercially available reagents. Peptides bearing a broad range of functionalities and containing up to 6 amino acids were selectively azidated at the carbamate&#8208;protected N&#8208;terminal residue in presence of the numerous other functional groups present on the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalizations of the obtained aminal compounds were achieved: cycloaddition reactions or C&#8722;C bond formations via a sequence of imine formation/nucleophilic addition were performed, offering an easy access to diversified peptides.

         <title>Helical Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Enantioselective Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical&#8208;NHC ligands were for the first time used as chiral ligands in enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. The introduction of the chirality was realized in a key post&#8208;functionalization step and led to the generation of a chiral NHC laterally substituted by a new configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicoidal moiety. This structural design allowed good activities and high ee values in the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered enynes.







Abstract
The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit. The chiral information was introduced in a key post&#8208;functionalization step of a NHC&#8208;gold(I) complex bearing a symmetrical anionic fluoreno[5]helicene substituent, leading to a racemic mixture of complexes featuring three correlated elements of chirality, namely central, axial and helical chirality. After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes. The high potential in asymmetric catalysis is demonstrated in the benchmark cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er.

         <title>Tuning Diradical Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Systems by Structural Isomerism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon was synthesized via the precise borylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbons of indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene. Because of the efficient conjugation between the boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, this molecule exhibits downshifted energy levels, blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, smaller diradical character and weak paramagnetic resonance in comparison to its isomeric molecule, thus demonstrating the significant electronic effects of structural isomerism on diradical properties.







Abstract
Tuning diradical character is an important topic for organic diradicaloids. Herein, we report the precise borylation enabling structural isomerism as an effective strategy to modulate diradical character and thereby properties of organic diradicaloids. We synthesized a new B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon that has the indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene &#960;&#8208;skeleton with the &#946;&#8208;carbons bonding to two boron atoms. Detailed theoretical and experimental results show that this bonding pattern leads to its distinctive electronic structures and properties in comparison to that of its isomeric molecule. This molecule has the efficient conjugation between boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, resulting in downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels. Moreover, it exhibits smaller diradical character and thereby inhibited diradical properties, such as significantly blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, larger energy bandgap and weak para&#8208;magnetic resonance. Notably, this B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon possesses much stronger Lewis acidity and its Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts display enhanced diradical character, demonstrating the positive effects of Lewis coordination on modulating diradical performance.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Ring Expansion Reactions of Calix[3]pyrrole&#8208;Related Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Growing rings: Calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrroles (n=0&#8764;3) were synthesized from cyclicoligoketone precursors to investigate strain&#8208;induced macrocyclic ring expansion reactions. As the number of inner NH sites increases, the macrocyclic ring strain increased. Detailed mechanism analysis revealed that calix[6]pyrrole type larger macrocycles were formed through regioselective cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization of linear intermediates.







Abstract
The recent discovery of calix[3]pyrrole, a porphyrinogen&#8208;like tripyrrolic macrocycle, has provided an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ring expansion reaction into calix[6]pyrrole. Here, we synthesized calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrrole (n=1&#8764;3) macrocycles to investigate the reaction scope and mechanism of the ring expansion. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that macrocyclic ring strain increases as the number of inner NH sites increases. While calix[1]furan[2]pyrrole exhibited almost quantitative conversion into calix[2]furan[4]pyrrole within 5&#8197;minutes, less&#8208;strained calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole and calix[3]furan were inert. However, N&#8208;methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring&#8208;expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]&#8208;type macrocycles.

However, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring-expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]-type macrocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Visible Light&#8208;Induced Reactions Using Different Photocatalysts: Transformation of Furans into 2&#8208;Pyridones via &#947;&#8208;Lactams Using a New Ring Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones has been developed. This expansion was incorporated into a multi&#8208;photocatalyst one pot process that starts from readily accessible furans and uses two metal&#8208;free photocatalysts (methylene blue and eosin). The photocatalytic cleavage of C&#8722;I bonds activated by an electron donor at the neighbouring carbon is achieved, using eosin as photocatalyst.







Abstract
A new photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones is described. The reaction is radical&#8208;triggered and was inspired by a late&#8208;stage oxidation commonly observed in fungal metabolism. The reaction is particularly powerful because it can be included in a one pot process which converts readily accessible furans directly into 2&#8208;pyridones through sequential photo&#8208;induced reactions (energy transfer and electron transfer). The study also unveiled unprecedented reactivity for the mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyst eosin, wherein it is used to cleave a C&#8722;I bond activated only by an electron donor on the neighbouring carbon.

         <title>Femtosecond Spectroscopy and Nonlinear Optical Properties of aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives in Solution</title>

The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties.







Abstract
The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives (1&#8211;4) were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Optical gain was revealed for nonfluorescent derivatives 3 and 4 in the near infrared (NIR) spectral range under femtosecond excitation. The values of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) cross&#8208;sections were obtained for 1&#8211;4 in dichloromethane using femtosecond Z&#8208;scans, and the role of bromine substituents in the molecular structures of 2 and 4 is discussed. The nature of the excited states involved in electronic transitions of these dyes was investigated using quantum&#8208;chemical TD&#8208;DFT calculations, and the obtained spectral parameters are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Significant 2PA (maxima cross&#8208;sections &#8764;2000&#8197;GM), and large ESA cross&#8208;sections &#8764;10&#8722;20&#8197;m2 of these new aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives 1&#8211;4 along with their measured high photostability reveal their potential for photonic applications in general and optical limiting in particular.

         <title>Highly Sensitive &#8220;Off/On&#8221; EPR Probes to Monitor Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study are reported two off/on EPR probes containing a nitroxide radical to study the enzymatic activity of carboxylesterases. Thanks to their low solubility in water, they aggregate to form stable micelles, which makes the probes EPR silent. In presence of the esterases enzymes the nitroxide radicals are release from the micelle giving an off/on transition and intense signal.







Abstract
The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity in&#8197;vitro. For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely Tempo&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;C12) and Tempo&#8208;2&#8208;C12 (T&#8208;2&#8208;C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T&#8208;C12 and T&#8208;2&#8208;C12&#8208;containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding function: A boronate&#8208;affinity ligand and an S&#8208;aryl thioester have been developed that are capable of labelling native Abs with a functional molecule. Additionally, a photoactivatable crosslinker allows purification of labelled Abs in a reagentless manner, thereby producing homogeneous Ab&#8208;drug conjugates.







Abstract
The excellent molecular recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have opened up exciting opportunities for biotherapeutic discovery. Taking advantage of the full potential of this tool necessitates affinity ligands capable of conjugating directly with small molecules to a defined degree of biorthogonality, especially when modifying natural Abs. Herein, a bioorthogonal boronate&#8208;affinity&#8208;based Ab ligand featuring a 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and an S&#8208;aryl thioester to label full&#8208;length Abs is reported. The photoactivatable linker in the acyl donor facilitated purification of azide&#8208;labelled Ab (N3&#8208;Ab) was quantitatively cleaved upon brief exposure to UV light while retaining the original Ab activity. Click reactions enabled the precise addition of biotin, a fluorophore, and a pharmacological agent to the purified N3&#8208;Abs. The resulting immunoconjugate showed selectivity against targeted cells. Bioorthogonal traceless design and reagentless purification allow this strategy to be a powerful tool to engineer native antibodies amenable to therapeutic intervention.

&#8220;N&#8208;hancing&#8221; the electron&#8208;acceptor strength by isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement in the peropyrene polycyclic aromatic core. The synthesis of an octaazaperopyrene (OAPP) dye is described along with its electrochemical and photophysical properties and placed in the general context of N&#8208;heteroatom derivatives of such polycyclic functional dyes.

Abstract
Ortho substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron&#8208;accepting behavior. Herein, the synthesis, as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye, is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the peri position of a bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted bay chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC8 and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.

The direct synthesis of diamine radical cations in crystalline form produced through oxidation of triphenylamine followed by the formation of either a C&#8722;N or a C&#8208;C bond is reported. Although the oxidative coupling of triphenylamine is well studied, diamine products are rarely captured in their radical cation state. The neutral diamine most frequently obtained from this reaction pathway is N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine. Herein, the capture of radical cations of diamines in crystalline form in one step starting with neutral triphenylamine was demonstrated, and the formation of two products (the radical cations of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine or N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine) depending on the oxidizing agent used was observed.

         <title>Kinase Sensing Based on Protein Interactions at the Catalytic Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical biosensor, based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection, is described. The phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, was absorbed on gold electrodes to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependant enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10&#8197;nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentrations. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.

         <title>Dielectric and Magnetic Relaxations Exhibited in a 2D Parallel Interpenetrating Frustrated Star Net</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>

Using organic ammonium HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) with a positive charge, a complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) with a 2D parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net was successfully obtained. The complex exhibits properties as a frustrated material with TN=4.2&#8197;K, and also presents new functions with dielectric and slow magnetic relaxations.







Abstract
Constructing multiple functional geometric frustration magnets is a hot topic in solid state chemistry and material science. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) was obtained successfully with HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) as charge balancer. The dipole reorientation of the rotator [HDMPDA]+ in the complex brings a structure transition which leads dielectric relaxation close to room temperature. Despite strong antiferromagnetic coupling existing between ions in the net, long&#8208;range order temperature TN of the complex is suppressed to 4.2&#8197;K by geometric frustration. Interestingly, below TN, a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus, 1 is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.

An electrochemical biosensor has been developed that is based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection. We adsorbed the phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, on gold electrodes and were able to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An electrochemical biosensor&lt;/b&gt; has been developed that is based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection. We adsorbed the phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, on gold electrodes and were able to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox-active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing.

         <title>Cover Feature: Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies (Chem. Eur. J. 17/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronic acid based biorthogonal probe in combination with an acyl donor has been introduced that enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of azide group at the Ser and Tyr residues of nonengineered full&#8208;length antibody. Further derivatization of this functional site was accomplished through click reaction, yielding well&#8208;defined immunoconjugates. The generality of this boronate&#8208;affinity method has been demonstrated on a number of monoclonal antibodies, all with different binding specificities. More information can be found in the Research Article by W.&#8208;S. Wayne&#8197;Chang, C.&#8208;C. Lin et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104178).

The incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, known as mechanophores, into macromolecular nanosystems has enabled access to previously unseen responsive behaviours as well as sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. The on&#8208;demand release or activation of compounds such as reaction catalysts, pharmaceutically active compounds, or monomers for self&#8208;healing of a material by an external trigger is a desired and important goal. In this review, we show how sonochemical activation by ultrasound (ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemistry) and the compression of bulk material can be used to create molecular cargo release systems from polymer&#8208;based architectures in solution. We also discuss important design concepts for these truly advanced materials, as well as their synthesis and applications. More information can be found in the Review article by B.&#8197;M. Schmidt et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103860).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 17, March 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of rearrangements in Scholl reaction, against anticipated oxidative coupling, results in serendipitous products. Such rearrangements are noticed to arise, either under Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acid condition alone or its combination with an oxidant, for substrates of various design. The products formed are majorly due to alkyl/aryl migrations, rearrangement followed by cyclization, and skeletal rearrangements. This review (https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202103530) showcases all these aspects, besides highlighting the evolving methods to arrest rearrangements in Scholl reaction.

This review portrays rearrangements with substrates of various genres in Scholl reaction. The rearranged products formed due to automerization, migration of substituents, rearrangement accompanied by cyclization, ring expansion, and ring contraction under Scholl&#8208;type reactions are gathered. In cases where new ring is constructed, they are grouped based on ring size. The crucial factors that drive rearrangements via enigmatic intermediates and the methods for successful prevention of rearrangements are also discussed.







Abstract
Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.

Abstract
The design and manipulation of (multi)functional materials at the nanoscale holds the promise of fuelling tomorrow's major technological advances. In the realm of macromolecular nanosystems, the incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, so called mechanophores, has resulted in unprecedented access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. Among the diverse force&#8208;activated motifs, the on&#8208;demand release or activation of compounds, such as catalysts, drugs, or monomers for self&#8208;healing, are sought&#8208;after since they enable triggering pristine small molecule function from macromolecular frameworks. Here, we highlight examples of molecular cargo release systems from polymer&#8208;based architectures in solution by means of sonochemical activation by ultrasound (ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemistry). Important design concepts of these advanced materials are discussed, as well as their syntheses and applications.

         <title>Acenaphthenoannulation Induced by Dual Lewis Acidity of Alumina</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have discovered dual (i.e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8208;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes via three&#8208;point annulation of naphthalene&#8217;s moiety. The versatility of the developed method is demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Ligand Substituent Effects on &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Contributions to Fe&#8722;N Bonds in Spin Crossover FeII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EDA&#8208;NOCV quantitatively probes bonding in 16 [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes as para&#8208;X substituent goes EWG&#8594;EDG. Calculated Fe&#8722;N sigma bond stabilisation, &#916;Eorb,&#963;, for the low spin complexes strongly correlates with: experimental spin crossover temperature T1/2 (R2=0.82), calculated chemical shift &#948;15N of free bppX (R2=0.95) and Hammett parameter &#963;p+(X) (R2=0.88); as well as with Mulliken NA(px) (R2=0.84) and NA(pz) populations (R2=0.93).







Abstract
The effect of para&#8208;substituent X on the electronic structure of sixteen tridentate 4&#8208;X&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl))&#8208;pyridine (bppX) ligands and the corresponding solution spin crossover [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes is analysed further, to supply quantitative insights into the effect of X on the &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the Fe&#8208;NA(pyridine) bonds. EDA&#8208;NOCV on the sixteen LS complexes revealed that neither &#916;Eorb,&#963;+&#960; (R2=0.48) nor &#916;Eorb,&#960; (R2=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T1/2 values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that &#916;Eorb,&#963; correlates well (R2=0.82) and implies that as X changes from EDG&#8594;EWG (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better &#963;&#8208;donor. This counter&#8208;intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the NA atomic orbitals: NA(px) involved in the Fe&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond vs. the perpendicular NA(pz) employed in the ligand aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. As X changes EDG&#8594;EWG, the electron population on NA(pz) decreases, making it a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor, whilst that in NA(px) increases, making it a better &#963;&#8208;bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T1/2 as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co&#8208;workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the para&#8208;X substituents on the
T1/2 values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M&#8594;L &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates in these M&#8722;L bonds. Here the quantitative EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis of the M&#8722;L bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M&#8722;L &#963;&#8208;versus &#960;&#8208;bonding in determining the observed T1/2, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the &#963;&#8208;bonding. Furthermore, our results are in perfect agreement with the &#916;E(HS&#8208;LS) vs. &#963;p+(X) correlation reported in their work.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Suberitines A&#8211;D Featuring Tunable Biomimetic Late&#8208;Stage Oxidative Dearomatization and Acetalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of suberitines A&#8211;D has been accomplished using cascade Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cationic cyclization, eliminative aromatization, Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization, and conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated regioselective oxidative dearomatization/O,O&#8208;acetalization. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox transformations of these marine natural products was supported by the isolation and characterization of the synthetic intermediate.







Abstract
Aaptaminoids are a unique family of marine alkaloids bearing a benzo[de][1,6]&#8208;naphthyridine core. This work describes the first total synthesis of suberitines A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), four typical dimeric natural aaptaminoids, employing a step&#8208;saving bidirectional strategy. Key methods applied in the total synthesis include a cationic cascade to construct the bis&#8208;isoquinoline(s) with Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and eliminative aromatization, and a Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization to generate the naphthyridine(s). The conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization and subsequent methanolysis or hydrolysis successfully served as a powerful biomimetic tool to elaborate the essential oxygenated functionalities of suberitines A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4) in proper solvent&#8208;combinations at the final stage of total synthesis. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate 23&#8201;a as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full&#8208;skeleton natural product&#8208;like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.

The biomimetic proposal employed in the late-stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate &lt;b&gt;23&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full-skeleton natural product-like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hedycaryol &#8211; Central Intermediates in Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis, Part II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hedycaryol is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes. This review discusses the unique chemistry of hedycaryol, its occurrence in Nature and all known compounds derived from it by terpene cyclisations. Structure elucidations including structural revisions and reasoning for the assignment of absolute configurations of the discussed compounds are presented.







Abstract
The known sesquiterpenes that arise biosynthetically from hedycaryol are summarised. Reasonings for the assignments of their absolute configurations are discussed. The analysis provided here suggests that reprotonations at the C1=C10 double bond of hedycaryol are directed toward C1 and generally lead to 6&#8211;6 bicyclic compounds, while reprotonations at the C4=C5 double bond occur at C4 and result in 5&#8211;7 bicyclic compounds.

         <title>Factors Governing the Catalytic Insertion of CO2 into Arenes &#8211; A DFT Case Study for Pd and Pt Phosphane Sulfonamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Which catalyst does the job? A DFT based catalyst screening with Pd/Pt complexes for the catalytic direct insertion of CO2 into the C&#8722;H bonds of arenes to provide a carbonic acid indicates that a catalytic process might well be achievable, when the multi&#8208;parameter system is carefully tuned. Not only the choice of metal is important, also the size and shape as well as the electronic influences of the ligand and the electronic influences of the substrate needs to be concerned. The appropriate base also must be found and some undesired side reactions must be suppressed.







Abstract
The potential of Pd/Pt complexes for catalytic carboxylation of arenes with CO2 is investigated by means of computational chemistry. Recently we reported that the bis[(2&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphino]&#8208;benzenesulfonamido palladium complex 1 inserts CO2 reversibly in its Pd&#8722;C(aryl) bond generating carboxylato complex 2. In the present work we study how geometric and electronic factors of various ligands and substrates influence the overall activation barrier (energy span, ES) of a potential catalytic cycle for arene carboxylation comprising this elementary step. The tendency of the key intermediates to dimerize and thus deactivating the potential catalysts is examined as well as the role of the base, which inevitably is needed to stabilize the reaction product. We show that Pd and Pt complexes I(Pd)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1 and I(Pt)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1 do not dimerize, enable the computation of complete catalytic cycles, and show interestingly low ES values of 26.8 and 24.5&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopropenes and Fluorinated Cyclopropanes via Michael Initiated Ring Closure of Alkyl Triflones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various cyclopropenes and fluorinated cyclopropanes were prepared from readily available alkyl triflones and electron&#8208;deficient alkenes via a Michael addition initiated ring closure (MIRC) process. This protocol not only has a broad substrates scope but also achieves good chemical yields and moderate diastereoselectivity. The mechanism may involve tandem Michael addition of triflones/intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization (elimination of &#8208;SO2CF3)/elimination of fluoride.







Abstract
A facile synthesis of cyclopropenes and fluorinated cyclopropanes from readily available alkyl triflones was developed. The reaction, regardless of electronic effect, gave products in good to excellent yields and moderate diastereoselectivity. The mechanism may involve tandem Michael addition of triflones/intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization (elimination of &#8208;SO2CF3)/elimination of fluoride.

         <title>Solid Base Assisted Dual&#8208;Promoted Heterogeneous Conversion of PVC to Metal&#8208;Free Porous Carbon Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is sustainably and efficiently recycled into porous carbon monolith with N,O co&#8208;doped structure by a solid&#8208;base&#8208;assisted low&#8208;temperature solvothermal dehalogenation. The dual&#8208;promoted conversion of solid&#8208;base catalyst and solvent decomposition can boost the dechlorination of PVC and increase the carbon yield. The upgraded metal&#8208;free porous carbon has good electrocatalytic hydrogen production capacity. This method provides a new strategy for low&#8208;temperature recycling upgrades for halogen&#8208;containing wastes.







Abstract
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used in daily life, but its waste has become a serious environmental problem. A solid base assisted low&#8208;temperature solvothermal dehalogenation was developed in this work to sustainably and efficiently transform PVC into high&#8208;value dimethylamine hydrochloride (DMACl) chemical and N,O co&#8208;doped carbon monolith with hierarchically porous structure. The synergistic promotion of solid&#8208;base catalyst and solvent decomposition with the removal of HCl can shift forward the chemical equilibrium to promote the dechlorination of PVC and increase the carbon yield. Meanwhile, the solid&#8208;base catalyst can also act as a pore&#8208;forming additive to fabricate the carbon monolith with hierarchical pores. Induced by the high specific surface area, hierarchical pores and N,O co&#8208;doped structure, the generated carbon monolith exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance towards H2 evolution. These discoveries shed light on the design of synergistically coupled solvent and solid catalyst to promote the heterogeneous conversion of waste chlorinated plastics into high&#8208;value chemicals for a sustainable future.

         <title>Encapsulation of Trimethine Cyanine in Cucurbit[8]uril: Solution versus Solid&#8208;State Inclusion Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different outcome of the dye Cy3 inclusion in CB[8] cavity in the solid state and in water has been elucidated via crystal structure determination and NMR, ITC and fluorescence titrations respectively. The initial 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex formed in water evolves spontaneously toward an insoluble linear polymeric structure.







Abstract
Inclusion of polymethine cyanine dyes in the cavity of macrocyclic receptors is an effective strategy to alter their absorption and emission behavior in aqueous solution. In this paper, the effect of the host&#8208;guest interaction between cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and a model trimethine indocyanine (Cy3) on dye spectral properties and aggregation in water is investigated. Solution studies, performed by a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques, indicate that the addition of CB[8] disrupts Cy3 aggregates, leading to the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex with an association constant of 1.5&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. At concentrations suitable for NMR experiments, the slow formation of a supramolecular polymer was observed, followed by precipitation. Single crystals X&#8208;ray structure elucidation confirmed the formation of a polymer with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry in the solid state.

Solution studies, performed by a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques, indicate that the addition of CB[8] disrupts Cy3 aggregates, leading to the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest complex with an association constant of 1.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. At concentrations suitable for NMR experiments, the slow formation of a supramolecular polymer was observed, followed by precipitation. Single crystals X-ray structure elucidation confirmed the formation of a polymer with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry in the solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Influence of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Structural Defects on Adsorption and Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, adsorption properties of theUiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic framework were investigated, with particular emphasis on the influence of structural defects. A series of UiO&#8208;66 samples were synthesized and characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques. Type I adsorption isotherms for low&#8208;temperature adsorption of N2 and Ar showed that micropore volume and specific surface area significantly increase with the number of defects. Adsorption of hexane isomers in UiO&#8208;66 was studied by means of quasi&#8208;equilibrated temperature&#8208;programmed desorption and adsorption (QE&#8208;TPDA) experimental and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. QE&#8208;TPDA profiles revealed that only defect&#8208;free UiO&#8208;66 exhibits distinct two adsorption states. This technique also yielded high&#8208;quality adsorption isobars that were successfully recreated using Grand&#8208;Canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulations, which, however, required refinement of the existing force fields. The calculations demonstrated the detailed mechanism of adsorption and separation of hexane isomers in the UiO&#8208;66 structure. The preferred tetrahedral cages provide suitable voids for bulky molecules, which is the reason for unusual "reverse" selectivity of UiO&#8208;66 towards di&#8208;branched alkanes. Interconnection of the tetrahedral cavities due to missing organic linkers greatly reduces the selectivity of the defected material.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intracellular excessive glutathione (GSH) consumes the cytotoxic  1  O  2  significantly, restricting the development and efficacy of  1  O  2  &#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). To face with this challenge, herein a heterogeneous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanohybrid was sequentially fabricated with porous coordination network&#8208;typed MOF as the core and photosensitizer, and Cu  II  &#8208;centered zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 as shell encapsulating cyanine 3&#8208;labelled siRNA. Upon internalized by cells and activated by GSH, the outer shell dissociated and released dye&#8208;labelled siRNA for GSH imaging and subsequent gene silencing in a controllable way. Meanwhile, the photosensitizing core was synchronously unlocked for the GSH&#8208;depleted intensified PDT along with the dissociation. The heterogeneous nanosystem achieved efficiently imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;gene theranostics with the cell apoptosis of 81.3%, which was 2.2 folded than that without PDT. Overall, the core&#8208;shell heterogeneous MOF hybrids exerted effective photodynamic&#8208;gene synergetic therapeutic efficacy by surmounting GSH&#8208;associated resistance, and paved a new way for designing intracellular stimulus&#8208;activated theranostic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Spectral Tuning Mechanism in Proteorhodopsin: The Dominant Role of Electrostatics Instead of Chromophore Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a photoactive proton pump found in marine bacteria. There are two phenotypes of PR exhibiting an environmental adaptation to the ocean&#8217;s depth which tunes their maximium absorption: blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). This blue/green color&#8208;shift is controlled by a glutamine to leucine substitution at position 105 which accounts for a 20 nm shift. Typically, spectral tuning in rhodopsins is rationalized by the external point charge model but the Q105L mutation is charge neutral. To study this tuning mechanism we employed the hybrid QM/MM method with sampling from molecular dynamics. Our results reveal that the positive partial charge of glutamine near the C  14  &#8211; C  15  bond of retinal shortens the effective conjugation length of the chromophore compared to the leucine residue. The derived mechanism can be applied to explain the color regulation in other retinal proteins and can serve as a guideline for rational design of spectral shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective, Transition Metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;Diboration of Alkyl Halides, Tosylates, and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of readily available secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols was developed. The use of KI and DMA is critical to the methodology, which circumvents the regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity problems. The transformation showed a broad substrate scope (75 examples), and practicality for the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products.







Abstract
Defunctionalization of readily available feedstocks to provide alkenes for the synthesis of multifunctional molecules represents an extremely useful process in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols. Control experiments demonstrated that the key to this high reactivity and selectivity is the addition of a combination of potassium iodide and N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA). The practicality and industrial potential of this transformation are demonstrated by its operational simplicity, wide functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules. From a drug discovery perspective, this synthetic method offers control of the position of diversification and diastereoselectivity in complex ring scaffolds, which would be especially useful in a lead optimization program.

         <title>Distinct Bimetallic Cooperativity Among Water Reduction Catalysts Containing [CoIIICoIII], [NiIINiII], and [ZnIIZnII] Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear species containing [Co2], [Ni2], and [Zn2] cores had their catalytic water reduction activity studied aiming to establish possible cooperative effects among neighboring metal centers. The [Co2] and [Ni2] species effectively produce H2 via substantially different mechanisms. Structural cooperativity is observed for the former, while no obvious cooperativity is seen for the latter. The [Zn2] species is expectedly not catalytic and serves to establish the need of redox metals to attain catalysis







Abstract
Three binuclear species [LCoIII2(&#956;&#8208;Pz)2](ClO4)3 (1), [LNiII2(CH3OH)2Cl2]ClO4 (2), and [LZnII2Cl2]PF6 (3) supported by the deprotonated form of the ligand 2,6&#8208;bis[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl) amino&#8208;methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol were synthesized, structurally characterized as solids and in solution, and had their electrochemical and spectroscopic behavior established. Species 1&#8211;3 had their water reduction ability studied aiming to interrogate the possible cooperative catalytic activity between two neighboring metal centers. Species 1 and 2 reduced H2O to H2 effectively at an applied potential of &#8722;1.6&#8197;VAg/AgCl, yielding turnover numbers of 2,820 and 2,290, respectively, after 30&#8197;minutes. Species 3 lacked activity and was used as a negative control to eliminate the possibility of ligand&#8208;based catalysis. Pre&#8208; and post&#8208;catalytic data gave evidence of the molecular nature of the process within the timeframe of the experiments. Species 1 showed structural, rather than electronic cooperativity, while species 2 displayed no obvious cooperativity. DFT methods complemented the experimental results determining plausible mechanisms.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) supported by the deprotonated form of the ligand 2,6-bis[bis(2-pyridylmethyl) amino-methyl]-4-methylphenol were synthesized, structurally characterized as solids and in solution, and had their electrochemical and spectroscopic behavior established. Species &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; had their water reduction ability studied aiming to interrogate the possible cooperative catalytic activity between two neighboring metal centers. Species &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; reduced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effectively at an applied potential of &#8722;1.6&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;Ag/AgCl&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding turnover numbers of 2,820 and 2,290, respectively, after 30&#8197;minutes. Species &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; lacked activity and was used as a negative control to eliminate the possibility of ligand-based catalysis. Pre- and post-catalytic data gave evidence of the molecular nature of the process within the timeframe of the experiments. Species &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; showed structural, rather than electronic cooperativity, while species &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; displayed no obvious cooperativity. DFT methods complemented the experimental results determining plausible mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Unprecedented FeMo6@Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66 Nanocomposite with Cascade Enzyme&#8208;Mimic Activity as Colorimetric Sensing Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel integrated nanozymes (INAzymes), FeMo6@Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66 (FC&#8208;66(n)), are designed and synthesized by encapsulating iron&#8208;based polyoxometalates into the ceria&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework. Due to the oxygen&#8208;driven reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ couple sites, the &#8220;Fenton&#8208;like&#8221; effect by iron centers, the &#8220;nanoscale proximity&#8221; effects by nanocages and their synergistic effects, FC&#8208;66(n) as INAzymes exhibit elegant cascade enzyme&#8208;mimic activities. Based on the excellent catalytic activity of the FC&#8208;66(n), an efficient fluorescent &#8220;turning&#8208;on&#8208;enhanced&#8221; platform for dopamine (DA) detection under near neutral conditions was established.







Abstract
Introducing the idea of integrated design and cascade activity into nanozyme, the novel integrated nanozymes (INAzymes), FeMo6@Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66 (FC&#8208;66(n)), were designed and synthesized by encapsulating iron&#8208;based polyoxometalates (FeMo6) into the ceria&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ce&#8208;Uio&#8208;66). Due to the oxygen&#8208;driven reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ couple sites, the &#8220;Fenton&#8208;like&#8221; effect by iron centers, the &#8220;nanoscale proximity&#8221; effects by nanocages, and their synergistic effects, FC&#8208;66(n) as INAzymes exhibit elegant cascade enzyme&#8208;mimic activities (oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and Fenton&#8208;like activity), which realizes INAzyme activities based on polyoxometalates based metal&#8211;organic framework (POMOFs). By employing dopamine (DA) detection as a model reaction, a high&#8208;efficient fluorescent &#8220;turning&#8208;on&#8208;enhanced&#8221; platform under near neutral conditions was established.

         <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Perylene Monoimides as Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells: A Study on the Structure&#8211;Property Relationship</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out with the old, in with the new: Perylene monoimide has long been in the shadow of its famous sibling: perylene diimide. And this, despite its talents! In this study, perylene monoimide takes the spotlight and it has things to tell.







Abstract
A series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors based on perylene monoimides coupled in the peri position through phenylene linkers were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;coupling reactions. Various substitution patterns were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experimental data to elucidate the geometry and their optical and electrochemical properties. Further investigations of the bulk properties with grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) gave insight into the stacking behavior of the acceptor thin films. Electrochemical and morphological properties correlate with the photovoltaic performance of devices with the polymeric donor PBDB&#8208;T and a maximum efficiency of 3.17&#8201;% was reached. The study gives detailed information about structure&#8211;property relationships of perylene&#8208;linker&#8208;perylene compounds.

         <title>Dye Sensitization Offers a Brighter Afterglow Nanoparticle Future for in&#8197;vivo Recharged Luminescent Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept paper reviews the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as existing challenges and proposes future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized afterglow nanoparticles.







Abstract
While concerns about improving recharged afterglow intensity in&#8197;vivo still motivate further exploration, afterglow nanoparticles (AGNP) offer unique optical merit for autofluorescence&#8208;free biological imaging. Apart from efforts enhancing the afterglow emission properties of AGNP, improving afterglow excitation response to visible or near infrared light is important but has lacked success. Dye sensitization has been used to improve the optical response of photovoltaic nanomaterials and to enhance upconversion luminescence efficiency. This concept has recently been expanded and applied to AGNPs. As a new multifunctional nanoprobe, such dye&#8208;sensitized AGNP takes advantage of both high spatial resolution fluorescence imaging and sensitive afterglow imaging. This Concept introduces the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as reviewing existing challenges and proposing future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized AGNPs.

         <title>A New Class of Task&#8208;Specific Imidazolium Salts and Ionic Liquids and Their Corresponding Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes for Immobilization on Electrochemically Active Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Task&#8208;specific polyaryl&#8208;/oligoether&#8208;substituted, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with linker moieties enable interaction with electrochemically active surfaces. Thus, electron and proton transfer ought to be facilitated along the side chains. When used as a precursor for carbene ligands, the complex's reactivity and potential catalytic activity can be increased by interaction with an electrode. The ether functionality also enhances the catalyst's solubility, for example, in oligoether&#8208;based ILs. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Meyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200100).

         <title>Azetidines&#8208;Containing Fluorescent Purine Analogs: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties</title>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Diruthenium Complexes with &#960;&#8208;Extended Alkenyl Ligands and Their F4TCNQ Charge&#8208;Transfer Salts**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of charge&#8208;transfer salts from diruthenium complexes with two differently extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligands and the strong electron&#8208;acceptor F4TCNQ is presented. These salts have been characterized by EPR, UV/Vis/NIR (in solution and solid states) and IR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The synthesis of dinuclear ruthenium alkenyl complexes with {Ru(CO)(PiPr3)2(L)} entities (L=Cl&#8722; in complexes Ru2&#8208;3 and Ru2&#8208;7; L=acetylacetonate (acac&#8722;) in complexes Ru2&#8208;4 and Ru2&#8208;8) and with &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2,7&#8208;divinylphenanthrenediyl (Ru2&#8208;3, Ru2&#8208;4) or 5,8&#8208;divinylquinoxalinediyl (Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8) as bridging ligands are reported. The bridging ligands are laterally &#960;&#8208;extended by anellating a pyrene (Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8) or a 6,7&#8208;benzoquinoxaline (Ru2&#8208;3, Ru2&#8208;4) &#960;&#8208;perimeter. This was done with the hope that the open &#960;&#8208;faces of the electron&#8208;rich complexes will foster association with planar electron acceptors via &#960;&#8208;stacking. The dinuclear complexes were subjected to cyclic and square&#8208;wave voltammetry and were characterized in all accessible redox states by IR, UV/Vis/NIR and, where applicable, by EPR spectroscopy. These studies signified the one&#8208;electron oxidized forms of divinylphenylene&#8208;bridged complexes Ru2&#8208;7, Ru2&#8208;8 as intrinsically delocalized mixed&#8208;valent species, and those of complexes Ru2&#8208;3 and Ru2&#8208;4 with the longer divinylphenanthrenediyl linker as partially localized on the IR, yet delocalized on the EPR timescale. The more electron&#8208;rich acac&#8722; congeners formed non&#8208;conductive 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 charge&#8208;transfer (CT) salts on treatment with the F4TCNQ electron acceptor. All spectroscopic techniques confirmed the presence of pairs of complex radical cations and F4TCNQ.&#8722; radical anions in these CT salts, but produced no firm evidence for the relevance of &#960;&#8208;stacking to their formation and properties.

         <title>Hole/Electron Transporting Materials for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review discusses the latest progress with interlayers used in non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells, in which the electron transporting layers are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, nonconjugated and conjugated electrolytes and the electron transporting layers are summarized categories of organic and inorganic ones.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptor based organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs) have witnessed rapid progress over the past few years owing to the intensive research efforts on novel electron donor and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, interfacial engineering, and device processing techniques. Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extraction from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the lates progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF&#8208;OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non&#8208;conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. In addition, some bifunctional interlayer materials served as both ETLs and HTLs are also introduced. Finally, the prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF&#8208;OSCs are provided.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes Derived from Ynamides Bearing Fluorophores**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) derived from ynamides and bearing diverse fluorene&#8208;based chromophores or other tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were prepared. The conceived sulfonamido&#8208;TCBDs showed remarkable photophysical properties covering a large range of wavelengths from the visible region to the NIR. They displayed an environment&#8208;sensitive emission that was observed in nonpolar solvents and in the solid state but was very weak in dichloromethane. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached values up to 7.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) bearing a large diversity of fluorophores were prepared following a multi&#8208;step synthesis. In a crucial last step, all compounds were obtained from the corresponding ynamides, which were particularly suitable for the formation of the TCBDs in the presence of tetracyanoethylene via a [2+2] cycloaddition/retroelectrocyclization step (CA&#8208;RE). Several fluorenyl derivatives in addition to phenanthrenyl and terphenyl ones provided ynamide&#8208;based TCBDs affording remarkable emission properties covering a large range of wavelengths. Those compounds emit both in solid state and in solution from the visible region to the NIR range, depending on the molecular structures. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached unforeseen values for such derivatives, up to 7.8&#8201;%. A huge sensitivity to the environment of the TCBDs has also been unraveled for most of the compounds since we observed a dramatic fall of the quantum yields when changing the solvent from cyclohexane to toluene, while they are almost non&#8208;emissive in dichloromethane.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid State and Solution Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chalcogen bonding (ChB) ability of Te is studied in symmetrical diaryl ditellurides ArTeTeAr. Among the two Te &#963;&#8208;holes, the one along the less polarized Te&#8208;Te bond was calculated as the more electropositive. This counter&#8208;intuitive situation is due to the hyperconjugation contribution from Te lone pair to the &#963;* of the adjacent Te which coincides with &#963;&#8208;hole along the more polarized Te&#8208;Ar bond. ArTeTeAr showed notable structural features in the solid state as a result of intermolecular Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Te ChB, such as a Te  4  rectangle through dimer aggregation or a triangular Te  3  motif, where one Te interacts with both Te atoms of a neighboring molecule through both its &#963;&#8208;hole and lone pair, in a slightly frustrated geometry. Lewis acidity of ArTeTeAr was also evaluated by NMR with R  3  PO as &#963;&#8208;hole acceptors in different solvents. Thus,  125  Te NMR allowed monitoring Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and delivering association constants (  K  a  ) for 1:1 adducts. The highest value of  K  a  = 90 M  &#8208;1  was measured for the adduct between ArTeTeAr bearing CF  3  groups and Et  3  PO in cyclohexane. Notably, by using  n  Bu  3  PO, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction was revealed by  19  F&#8208;  1  H HOESY showing spatial proximity between CF  3  and CH  3  of  n  Bu  3  PO.</dc:description>

Thus,  125  Te NMR allowed monitoring Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and delivering association constants (  K  a  ) for 1:1 adducts. The highest value of  K  a  = 90 M  -1  was measured for the adduct between ArTeTeAr bearing CF  3  groups and Et  3  PO in cyclohexane. Notably, by using  n  Bu  3  PO, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction was revealed by  19  F-  1  H HOESY showing spatial proximity between CF  3  and CH  3  of  n  Bu  3  PO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A regioselective [3+3] annulation of alkynyl ketimines with &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones for the synthesis of polysubstituted 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives with a quaternary CF3&#8208;containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst, providing the desired products in up to 99&#8201;% yield. The method tolerates some variations in the &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones scope. The products could be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale and several products were conveniently transformed.







Abstract
Regioselective [3+3] annulation of alkynyl ketimines with &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones for the synthesis of polysubstituted 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives with a quaternary CF3&#8208;containing center has been realized by using Cu(OAc)2 as the catalyst. The novel strategy tolerates a wide range of &#945;&#8208;CF3 alkynyl ketimines and &#945;&#8208;cyano ketones with both aryl and alkyl substitutents. A preliminary asymmetric synthesis of chiral product 3 has been attempted by using copper and chiral thiourea as the cocatalyst with excellent yields (86&#8208;99&#8201;%) and good enantioselectivities (71&#8211;78&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, product 3&#8201;aa could be obtained on a gram&#8208;scale reaction with 75&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization. Several products were also transformed readily. Control experiments indicate that the reaction involves a process with a base&#8208;catalyzed or chiral thiourea&#8208;catalyzed Mannich&#8208;type reaction followed by a highly regioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing reaction on the alkynyl moiety in a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig fashion.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis for a Wide Variety of Patellamide Derivatives and Phosphatase Activity of Copper&#8208;Patellamide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthetic procedure for natural and artificial patellamides, found in the ascidians of the Great Barrier Reef, is presented. These macrocycles are known to tightly bind CuII, and the variety of easily available patellamide derivatives allows to carefully study the reactivity as a function of the structure of the macrocycle. This has been done by experiment and DFT for phosphatase activity as a possible reaction of metabolic relevance.







Abstract
Copper complexes of patellamides have shown catalytic activity in a variety of reactions but their biological function remains unknown. There are significant differences between the natural macrocycles and synthetic analogues in the various catalytic activities. It therefore is essential to be able to perform in&#8197;vivo and ex vivo reference measurements with the natural patellamide macrocycles, very similar derivatives and a large range of synthetic analogues. The preparative method described allows for a highly adaptable synthetic process producing building blocks for a large range of patellamide derivatives: apart from natural compounds, a new synthetic patellamide was prepared that does not have any substituents at any of the four heterocycles. Together with the variation of substituents at the aliphatic backbone, this allowed to elucidate the catalytic activity for phosphoester hydrolysis as a function of the structure and dynamics of the dicopper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes, both by experiment and DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution at Visible Light Wavelengths by Using a Photocathode with Modal Strong Coupling between Plasmons and a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles, p&#8208;type nickel oxide, and a platinum film under modal strong coupling condition was fabricated. The photocathode absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling. The modal strong coupling boosted hydrogen evolution through the reduction of water by hot&#8208;electron, which involves hot hole&#8208;injection from gold to nickel oxide.







Abstract
Hot&#8208;hole injection from plasmonic metal nanoparticles to the valence band of p&#8208;type semiconductors and reduction by hot electrons should be improved for efficient and tuneable reduction to obtain beneficial chemical compounds. We employed the concept of modal strong coupling between plasmons and a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) nanocavity to enhance the hot&#8208;hole injection efficiency. We fabricated a photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8722;NPs), p&#8208;type nickel oxide (NiO), and a platinum film (Pt film) (ANP). The ANP structure absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500&#8197;nm to 850&#8197;nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling between the plasmons of Au&#8722;NPs and the FP nanocavity of NiO on a Pt film. All wavelength regions of the hybrid modes of the modal strong coupling system promoted hot&#8208;hole injection from the Au&#8722;NPs to NiO and proton/water reduction by hot electrons. The incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency based on H2 evolution through water/proton reduction by hot electrons reached 0.2&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm and 0.04&#8201;% at 800&#8197;nm.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Di&#8208;Pyridyl&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of iodides and bromides of Al, Ga and In with dipyridyl ligands under various conditions lead to a large number of products including cationic two&#8208;dimensional MOFs that exhibit interpenetration and polycatenation. Charge compensation is achieved via tetra&#8208;halido&#8208;metal anions and iodide anions. The latter allows for chemisorption of I2 under formation of I3&#8722; suitable for the capture of radioisotopes of iodine.







Abstract
Eight cationic, two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized in reactions of the group 13 metal halides AlBr3, AlI3, GaBr3, InBr3 and InI3 with the dipyridyl ligands 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpe), 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpa) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy). Seven of them follow the general formula 2&#8734;[MX2(L)2]A, M=Al, In, X=Br, I, A&#8722;=[MX4]&#8722;, I&#8722;, I3&#8722;, L=bipy, bpa, bpe. Thereby, the porosity of the cationic frameworks can be utilized to take up the heavy molecule iodine in gas&#8208;phase chemisorption vital for the capture of iodine radioisotopes. This is achieved by switching between I&#8722; and the polyiodide I3&#8722; in the cavities at room temperature, including single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. The MOFs are 2D networks that exhibit (4,4)&#8208;topology in general or (6,3)&#8208;topology for 2&#8734;[(GaBr2)2(bpa)5][GaBr4]2&#8901;bpa. The two&#8208;dimensional networks can either be arranged to an inclined interpenetration of the cationic two&#8208;dimensional networks, or to stacked networks without interpenetration. Interpenetration is accompanied by polycatenation. Due to the cationic character, the MOFs require the counter ions [MX4]&#8722;, I&#8722; or I3&#8722; counter ions in their pores. Whereas the [MX4]&#8722;, ions are immobile, iodide allows for chemisorption. Furthermore, eight additional coordination polymers and complexes were identified and isolated that elaborate the reaction space of the herein reported syntheses.

&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;[MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]A, M=Al, In, X=Br, I, A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=[MX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L=bipy, bpa, bpe&lt;/i&gt;. Thereby, the porosity of the cationic frameworks can be utilized to take up the heavy molecule iodine in gas-phase chemisorption vital for the capture of iodine radioisotopes. This is achieved by switching between I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the polyiodide I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the cavities at room temperature, including single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation. The MOFs are 2D networks that exhibit (4,4)-topology in general or (6,3)-topology for &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;[(GaBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;bpa&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;][GaBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;bpa&lt;/i&gt;. The two-dimensional networks can either be arranged to an inclined interpenetration of the cationic two-dimensional networks, or to stacked networks without interpenetration. Interpenetration is accompanied by polycatenation. Due to the cationic character, the MOFs require the counter ions [MX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; counter ions in their pores. Whereas the [MX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, ions are immobile, iodide allows for chemisorption. Furthermore, eight additional coordination polymers and complexes were identified and isolated that elaborate the reaction space of the herein reported syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigation of Molecular Iridium Fluorides IrFn (n=1&#8211;6): A Combined Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IR spectra of molecular iridium fluorides IrFn (n=1&#8211;6) isolated in solid noble gas matrices are presented. Efficient formation of IrF5 together with minor IrF3 was achieved by irradiation of IrF6 with UV light, while subsequent irradiation leads to almost quantitative formation of IrF4. The presence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects leading to a triplet ground state with C4v symmetry of IrF5 was confirmed spectroscopically under cryogenic conditions.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;initiated defluorination of iridium hexafluoride (IrF6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices at 6&#8197;K, and their photoproducts are characterized by IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The primary photoproducts obtained after irradiation with &#955;=365&#8197;nm are iridium pentafluoride (IrF5) and iridium trifluoride (IrF3), while longer irradiation of the same matrix with &#955;=278&#8197;nm produced iridium tetrafluoride (IrF4) and iridium difluoride (IrF2) by Ir&#8722;F bond cleavage or F2 elimination. In addition, IrF5 can be reversed to IrF6 by adding a F atom when exposed to blue&#8208;light (&#955;=470&#8197;nm) irradiation. Laser irradiation (&#955;=266&#8197;nm) of IrF4 also generated IrF6, IrF5, IrF3 and IrF2. Alternatively, molecular binary iridium fluorides IrFn (n=1&#8211;6) were produced by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated iridium atoms with elemental fluorine in excess neon and argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. Computational studies up to scalar relativistic CCSD(T)/triple&#8208;&#950; level and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computations including spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects supported the formation of these products and provided detailed insights into their molecular structures by their characteristic Ir&#8722;F stretching bands. Compared to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, the influence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling dominates in IrF5, leading to a triplet ground state with C4v symmetry, which was spectroscopically detected in solid argon and neon matrices.

         <title>Decoration Strategy in Para Boron Position: An Effective Way to Achieve Ideal Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable narrowband emitters: In the &#8220;decoration strategy in para B position&#8221;, introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission without undesirable spectral broadening, proving a reasonable molecular design approach for color&#8208;tunable, quenching&#8208;resistant, narrowband and stable multi&#8208;resonance emitters.







Abstract
Narrowband, full&#8208;color, and quenching&#8208;resistant emitters are urgently needed for the next generation high&#8208;resolution displays. Though the flourishment of narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters in blue region, these materials still face thorny challenges such as effective light&#8208;color regulation strategies and concentration&#8208;induced spectral broadening/emission quenching. Herein, the research status of an effective &#8220;decoration strategy for para B position&#8221; is highlighted. On one hand, the introduction of an electron donor or acceptor could induce a hypsochromic&#8208; or bathochromic&#8208;shift emission, respectively, without undesirable FWHM broadening. On the other hand, a more advanced molecular motif is further proposed through adopting a peripheral benzene ring on the para position of the B&#8208;substituted phenyl in MR core to construct the high&#8208;purity, high&#8208;efficiency, quenching&#8208;resistant and stable MR emitters. Such concept is expected to provide a possible way for the modification, optimization and expansion of MR emitters to meet more possible applications.

         <title>Systematic Exploration of Furoindolizine&#8208;based Molecular Framework towards a Versatile Fluorescent Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photophysical behaviors of fluorescent molecules largely determine their major utility in biological studies. Despite their well&#8208;defined characteristics, classical fluorophores have often been challenged by their limited synthetic methodology and tunability in adjusting intrinsic optical properties. A novel heterocyclic core equipped with modular functional groups may offer the flexibility to control its photophysical properties with a minimum synthetic effort. By conducting a systematic analysis guided by quantum calculations, we proposed the furoindolizine&#8208;based molecular framework as a unique fluorescent platform capable of providing versatile photophysical properties with minimal structural modification. Furoindolizine derivatives exhibited broadly tunable photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge transfer characteristics using synergistic interaction between two functional moieties. Furthermore, this modular platform enabled us to secure live&#8208;cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide&#183;&#183;&#183;alkyne interaction: A crucial attractive force for their preorganization for topochemical cycloaddition reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report&#160;a new class of attractive intermolecular interaction between azide and ethynyl structural entities in a wide range of molecular crystals. We systematically evaluated this interaction using eleven geometrically different structural motifs which are preorganized to direct solid&#8208;state topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. Supramolecular features of azide and alkyne interaction have been mapped through various crystallographic and quantum chemical approaches. The topological analysis shows that the azide&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;alkyne interactions are manifested with the noticeable participation of electron densities. Interestingly, the reorientation of atomic polarizabilities in vicinal azide and alkyne groups upon interaction in crystals favors the soft orbital&#8208;guided TAAC reactions. Moreover, various solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase energy decomposition methods of individual azide&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;alkyne interactions summa&#8208;rize that the strength (varies from &#8208;5.7 to &#8208;30.1 kJ/mol) is primarily guided by the dispersion forces with influencing contribution from the electrostatics.</dc:description>

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Resorcyclic Acid&#8208;Based AIEgens for Illuminating Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules which showed remarkable aggregation induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by the pH and temperature dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.</dc:description>

         <title>Intense Photoinduced Intervalence Charge Transfer in High&#8208;Valent Iron Mixed Phenolate/Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report high&#8208;valent iron complexes, supported by  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands that undergo ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) upon photoexcitation.&#160; The resulting excited states &#8211; with a lifetime in the pico&#8208;second range &#8211; feature a ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valence system and intense inter&#173;valence charge transfer bands in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region.&#160; Upon oxidation of the complex, corres&#173;ponding intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) absorptions are also observed in the ground state.&#160; We suggest that the spectroscopic hallmarks of such LMCT states provide useful tools to decipher excited state decay mechanisms in high&#8208;valent NHC complexes.&#160; Our obser&#173;vations further indicate that NHC&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands are not sufficiently strong donors to prevent the population of excited metal&#8208;centered (MC) states in high&#8208;valent iron complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyl group migration in pyranosides as studied by experimental and computational methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl group migration affects the synthesis, isolation, manipulation and purification of all acylated organic compounds containing free hydroxyl groups, in particular carbohydrates. While several isolated studies on the migration phenomenon in different buffers have been reported, comprehensive insights into the overall migration process in different monosaccharides under similar conditions have been lacking. Here, we have studied the acyl migration in different monosaccharides using five different acyl groups by a combination of experimental, kinetic and theoretical tools. The results show that the anomeric configuration in the monosaccharide has a major influence on the migration rate, together with the relative configurations of the other hydroxyl groups and the nature of the migrating acyl group. Full mechanistic model, based on computations, demonstrates that the acyl migration proceeds through an anionic stepwise mechanism with linear dependence on the [OH&#8208;] and the pKa of the hydroxyl group toward which the acyl group is migrating.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) macrocyclic dyads con&#173;sisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothio&#173;phene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para  &#8208;quinone methides ( p  &#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B 2  pin 2  ) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3v  was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is a very important fundamental transformation for conversion of C&#8208;F bond into C&#8208;H bond in organic synthesis. In the past decade, much progress has been achieved with HDF through the utility of low&#8208;valent metals, transition metal complexes and main&#8208;group Lewis acids. Recently, novel methods have been introduced for this purpose via photo&#8208; and electrochemical pathways, which would be of great significance, due to considerable environmental and economic advantages.

         <title>Luminescent Surface&#8208;Tethered Polymer Brush Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;tethered polymers are unique molecular architectures that have been recently used in advanced sensors, electronics, and biomedical applications. However, techniques for characterizing these materials in their surface&#8208;tethered form remain limited. The incorporation of luminescent functionality into these materials has enabled new characterization methods, while also unlocking new applications in optoelectronics, stenography and sensing. Micron&#8208;scale photolithography techniques have recently enabled the preparation of high&#8208;resolution patterns, as well as architectures with unique photophysical properties. Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface tethered polymers, as well as the short&#8208;term challenges and opportunities in the field.</dc:description>

Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli-responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface tethered polymers, as well as the short-term challenges and opportunities in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chromans through Bifunctional Enamine&#8208;Metal Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. A concise synthetic method for asymmetric synthesis of chromans from cyclohexanones and salicylaldehydes has been developed to afford tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers in good yields (up to 87%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 11:1:1 dr). This difficult organic transformation was achieved through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. It is believed that the strong activation of the salicylaldehydes through chelating to the metal Lewis acid and the bifunctional nature of the catalyst accounts for the high yields and enantioselectivity of the reaction. The absolute configurations of the chroman products were established through X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT Calculations were conducted to understand the mechanism and stereoselectivity of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Electrochemical Capacitors with Carbon Related Materials as Electrodes for AC Line Filtering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), are getting more essential for the rapid development of electronic devices. In order to satisfy the requirements of ECs with fast rate capability, appreciable capacitance density, numerous efforts have been made towards the preparation and design of electrode materials, which is a decisive factor in the performance of ECs. Carbon related electrode materials have been widely demonstrated to significantly increase the performance of ECs because of its light weight, high strength and high processability. In this concept, the latest advances in the rational design and controllable fabrication of carbon related electrode materials including planar two&#8208;dimensional materials, random three&#8208;dimensional materials, and vertical carbon materials are summarized. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress on carbon&#8208;based ECs have been discussed from the viewpoint of structure of electrode and performance of ECs. Finally, this concept present integrated perspectives on further design and preparation of carbon related ECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Deep&#8208;blue Luminescent Twisted Diphenylamino Terphenyl Emitters by Bromine&#8208;Lithium Exchange Borylation&#8208;Suzuki Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylationSuzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep&#8208;blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emissive Squaraine&#8208;AIEgen in Elastomer Enabling High Contrast and Fast Thermoresponse for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two challenges remain for organic thermoresponsive materials; one is to develop high performance red&#8208;emissive thermoresponsive materials, while another is to simultaneously achieve high contrast ratio (CR), fast and reversible thermoresponse in a single element. Herein, we not only develop a new deep&#8208;red emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen (TPE&#8208;SQ12) based on pyrylium end group, which is suitable for fabricating high performance thermoresponsive materials, but also show an effective approach to improve both CR (~ten times increase) and response time (less than 3 seconds), that is, molecularly dispersing AIEgen into an elastomer, attributed to the significantly expanded free volume of elastomer upon increasing the temperature that can activate the AIEgen intramolecular movements more pronouncedly. Double encryption and temperature mapping systems have been separately established using our designed elastomer/TPE&#8208;SQ12 film, showing the great potential for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing. Finally, white emission is further achieved by co&#8208;doping TPE&#8208;SQ12 with cyan dye into elastomer, which enables fluorescent thermochromism for improving the temperature mapping ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Bridged Triphenylamines Comprising Five&#8208; and Seven&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered rings is presented. The compounds are potent electron donors capable to undergo donor/acceptor interactions with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors both in the solid state and solution. These interactions were evaluated by IR and UV/vis spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. The vinylene&#8208;bridged compound was oxidized to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diketone which readily underwent acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with selected 1,2&#8208;phenylenediamines. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline derivatives represent valuable building blocks for the development of functional chromophores upon appropriate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow for precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of phospha&#8208;phenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to altered electronic distribution, may provide them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. Particularly, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show anti&#8208;proliferative properties in 14 cell lines including gliomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancer, reaching IC  50  values as low as 0.73 &#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with the photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra&#8208;HB) is one of the best known examples of non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bond in amino&#8208;alcohols and amino&#8208;ethers is one of the weakest. In contrast to the strong OH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N intramolecular hydrogen bond, the strength of the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O bond can hardly be measured with conventional spectroscopic methods, even for simple amino&#8208;alcohols, since the band belonging to the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O conformer merges with the free OH band. In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;ethanol and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O intra&#8208;HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined. In the second series, the influence of alkylation of the amino&#8208;group was investigated. In the third series, the effect of extending the alkyl chain between functional groups was studied.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of a Medicinally&#8208;Relevant Benzopyran using an Oscillatory Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic deracemization processes, such as crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs), offer the opportunity to combine racemization and resolution processes, to provide high yields of enantiomerically pure compounds. To date, few of these processes have incorporated photochemical racemization. By combining batch crystallization with a flow photoreactor for efficient irradiation, it is possible to perform such deracemization in an effective, scalable and high yielding manner. After applying design of experiment (DoE) principles and mathematical modelling, the most efficient parameter set could be identified, leading to excellent results in just 4 hours reaction time: isolated yield of 82% and assay ee of 96%. Such photochemical racemization methods can serve to open new avenues for preparation of enantiomerically pure functional molecules on both small and industrially&#8208;relevant scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxy groups enhance [2]rotaxane anion binding selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of two [2]rotaxanes containing an interlocked three dimensional binding cavity formed from a pyridinium bis(amide) axle component containing two phenol donors, and an isophthalamide based macrocycle. In the competitive solvent mixture 1:1 CDCl  3  :CD  3  OD, one of the receptors exhibits a much higher selectivity preference for chloride than an analogous rotaxane without the hydroxy groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveal the chloride anion guest encapsulated within the interlocked binding cavity, though not all of the hydrogen bond donors are utilised. Computational semi&#8208;empirical simulations indicate that secondary intermolecular interactions occur between the axle hydroxy hydrogen bond donors and the [2]rotaxane macrocycle components, contributing to a more preorganised binding pocket, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective ferric ions detection has been carried out with systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs. Among them, al the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions.







Abstract
The potential emergence of fluorescence&#8208;based techniques has propelled research towards developing probes that can sense trace metal ions specifically. Although luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are well suited for this application, the role of building blocks towards detection is not fully understood. In this work, a systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites is carried out in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs, and targeting a model metal ion&#8208;Fe3+. All the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. Detailed experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigation is carried out in addition to demonstration of UiO&#8208;67@N being able to sense trace amount of Fe3+ ions in synthetic biological water sample. Further, UiO&#8208;67@N based mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) has been prepared and employed to mimic the real time Fe3+ ions detection in water.

         <title>Topologically&#8208;Interlocked Minicircles as Probes of DNA Topology and DNA&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized the topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircle rotaxane and catenane inside a frame&#8208;shaped DNA origami. To probe the DNA&#8208;protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on the prepared interlocked structures and other DNAs with different topologies. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were reluctant for the restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA play a major role in DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
DNA minicircles exist in biological contexts, such as kinetoplast DNA, and are promising components for creating functional nanodevices. They have been used to mimic the topological features of nucleosomal DNA and to probe DNA&#8208;protein interactions such as HIV&#8208;1 and PFV integrases, and DNA gyrase. Here, we synthesized the topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircle rotaxane and catenane inside a frame&#8208;shaped DNA origami. These minicircles are 183 bp in length, constitute six individual single&#8208;stranded DNAs that are ligated to realize duplex interlocking, and adopt temporary base pairing of single strands for interlocking. To probe the DNA&#8208;protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on DNAs with different topologies such as free linear duplex or duplex constrained inside origami and free or topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircles. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were resistant to restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA, such as flexibility, curvature, and groove orientation, play a major role in DNA&#8208;protein interactions.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaromatization Route to Cycloparaphenylenes that Exhibit Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes via the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylenes with monoynes. The thus obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes, exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and are noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have ordinally AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenyl&#8208;ethene and benzene skeletons.







Abstract
A high&#8208;yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes has been developed via reductive aromatization of a diyne bearing two cyclohexadiene units giving a cyclophenylene&#8208;ethynylene (CPE) followed by the cationic rhodium(I)/dppe complex&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition (cycloaromatization) of the CPE with monoynes. The thus&#8208;obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene&#8208;triphenylenes ([8]CPPTs), exhibited definite aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). This molecule is noteworthy as a novel AIE&#8208;active cycloarylene that does not have well&#8208;known AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenylethene and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraphenylbenzene skeletons. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of the AIE&#8208;active [8]CPPTs revealed their highly ordered packing structures in which the rotation of the triphenylene moieties is restricted.

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a high-yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes via the cationic rhodium(I)-catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyclophenylene-ethynylenes with monoynes. The thus obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene-triphenylenes, exhibited definite aggregation-induced emission (AIE), and are noteworthy as a novel AIE-active cycloarylene that does not have ordinally AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenyl-ethene and benzene skeletons.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-yielding new route to substituted cycloparaphenylenes has been developed via reductive aromatization of a diyne bearing two cyclohexadiene units giving a cyclophenylene-ethynylene (CPE) followed by the cationic rhodium(I)/dppe complex-catalyzed intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition (cycloaromatization) of the CPE with monoynes. The thus-obtained products, substituted [8]cycloparaphenylene-triphenylenes ([8]CPPTs), exhibited definite aggregation-induced emission (AIE). This molecule is noteworthy as a novel AIE-active cycloarylene that does not have well-known AIE luminogens, such as tetraphenylethene and 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylbenzene skeletons. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of the AIE-active [8]CPPTs revealed their highly ordered packing structures in which the rotation of the triphenylene moieties is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multi&#8208;Functionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioester&#8208;selective ketonization was achieved using diarylcuprates(I) generated in situ from copper(I) salts and aryl Grignard reagents in a 1:1.3&#8211;1.5 ratio under ambient temperature. During ketonization, various functional groups, such as carbonyl functionalities (ketones, esters, and amides), O &#8208;protecting groups, halogens, and heteroarenes, were tolerant to afford multi&#8208;functionalized ketones in excellent yields. This copper&#8208;mediated ketonization system was applicable for the synthesis of not only gluconic acid&#8208;derived ketone 6 as a synthetic intermediate in the transformation to canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, but also thiolactol 8 , a valuable synthetic intermediate for (+)&#8208;biotin. Control experiments using an isolated diphenylcuprate(I), [CuPh 2 ] &#8211; ( 12 ), and DFT calculations revealed that this ketonization proceeded via oxidative addition of the C&#8212;S bond of thioesters to [CuPh 2 ] &#8211; , and reductive elimination from the Cu(III) intermediate produced the corresponding ketone and an inactive species [(RS)CuPh] &#8211; , the latter of which reacted with [CuPh] 4 ( 11 ) to regenerate the reactive diphenylcuprate(I).</dc:description>

         <title>Thiourea&#8208; and Amino&#8208;Substituted Benzoxadiazole Dyes with Large Stokes Shifts as Red&#8208;Emitting Probe Monomers for Imprinted Polymer Layers Targeting Carboxylate&#8208;Containing Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Signalling in the red, when antibiotics are bound to novel dual functional donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted benzoxadiazole probes with unprecedented large Stokes shifts, containing a benzoylthiourea receptor for carboxylate binding and a tertiary amine&#8208;appended methacrylate linker for covalent matrix incorporation. The selective binding of a model antibiotic enoxacin is achieved by the integration of the polymerizable probes into molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) shells on submicron silica particles, the dyes retaining their red&#8208;shifted emission based on two concerted intramolecular charge transfer processes.







Abstract
Bifunctional fluorescent molecular oxoanion probes based on the benzoxadiazole (BD) chromophore are described which integrate a thiourea binding motif and a polymerizable 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate unit in the 4,7&#8208;positions of the BD core. Concerted charge transfer in this electron donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor architecture endows the dyes with strongly Stokes shifted (up to &gt;250&#8197;nm) absorption and fluorescence. Binding of electron&#8208;rich carboxylate guests at the thiourea receptor leads to further analyte&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts of the emission, shifting the fluorescence maximum of the complexes to &#8805;700&#8197;nm. Association constants for acetate are ranging from 1&#8211;5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. Integration of one of the fluorescent probes through its polymerizable moiety into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) grafted from the surface of submicron silica cores yielded fluorescent MIP&#8208;coated particle probes for the selective detection of antibiotics containing aliphatic carboxylate groups such as enoxacin (ENOX) at micromolar concentrations in highly polar solvents like acetonitrile.

         <title>Controlling Tautomerization in Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the reproducible access to stable, nonaromatic PN&#8208;heterocyclic quinoidal cores. The molecules exhibit solution and solid&#8208;state &#955;max red&#8208;shifts, and their solid&#8208;state structures exhibit tautomer&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Inclusion of a second nitrogen atom in the aromatic core of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen (PN) heterocycles results in unexpected tautomerization to a nonaromatic form. This tautomerization, initially observed in the solid state through X&#8208;ray crystallography, is also explained by computational analysis. We prepared an electron deficient analogue (2&#8201;e) with a fluorine on the pyridine ring and showed that the weakly basic pyridine resisted tautomerization, providing key insights to why the transformation occurs. To study the difference in solution vs. solid&#8208;state heterocycles, alkylated analogues that lock in the quinoidal tautomer were synthesized and their different 1H NMR and UV/Vis spectra studied. Ultimately, we determined that all heterocycles are the aromatic tautomer in solution and all but 2&#8201;e switch to the quinoidal tautomer in the solid state. Better understanding of this transformation and under what circumstances it occurs suggest future use in a switchable on/off hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed receptor that can be tuned for complementary hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Foldable Detergents for Membrane Protein Study: Importance of Detergent Core Flexibility in Protein Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem triazine&#8208;based maltoside with the ethylene diamine linker (i.&#8201;e., TZM&#8722;E9) conferred markedly enhanced stability to the tested membrane proteins compared to the hydrazine linker analog and the conventional dodecyl maltoside (DDM): prokaryotic leucine transporter (LeuT), human &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR), and mouse &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (MOR). The favorable behaviors of this detergent for membrane protein stability are mainly due to its foldable nature, originating from the flexible ethylene diamine linker present between the two triazine units.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are of biological and pharmaceutical significance. However, their structural study is extremely challenging mainly due to the fact that only a small number of chemical tools are suitable for stabilizing membrane proteins in solution. Detergents are widely used in membrane protein study, but conventional detergents are generally poor at stabilizing challenging membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and protein complexes. In the current study, we prepared tandem triazine&#8208;based maltosides (TZMs) with two amphiphilic triazine units connected by different diamine linkers, hydrazine (TZM&#8722;Hs) and 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (TZM&#8722;Es). These TZMs were consistently superior to a gold standard detergent (DDM) in terms of stabilizing a few membrane proteins. In addition, the TZM&#8722;Es containing a long linker showed more general protein stabilization efficacy with multiple membrane proteins than the TZM&#8722;Hs containing a short linker. This result indicates that introduction of the flexible1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine linker between two rigid triazine rings enables the TZM&#8722;Es to fold into favourable conformations in order to promote membrane protein stability. The novel concept of detergent foldability introduced in the current study has potential in rational detergent design and membrane protein applications.

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Based Approach to Developing Electrocatalytic Variants of Slow Oxidations: Application to Hydride Abstraction&#8208;Initiated Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxocarbenium and acyliminium ions can be generated with sub&#8208;stoichiometric loadings of oxoammonium ions under anhydrous conditions through in&#8197;situ electrochemical oxidant regeneration. Decomposition through radical cation intermediates can be avoided by using constant potential conditions and current is maintained through the interplay between cation stability, oxidant strength, overpotential, and reaction concentration.







Abstract
Electrochemical oxidant regeneration is challenging in reactions that have a slow redox step because the steady&#8208;state concentration of the reduced oxidant is low, causing difficulties in maintaining sufficient current or preventing potential spikes. This work shows that applying an understanding of the relationship between intermediate cation stability, oxidant strength, overpotential, and concentration on reaction kinetics delivers a method for electrochemical oxoammonium ion regeneration in hydride abstraction&#8208;initiated cyclization reactions, resulting in the development of an electrocatalytic variant of a process that has a high oxidation transition state free energy. This approach should be applicable to expanding the scope of electrocatalysis to include additional slow redox processes.

         <title>Engineering of Portable Smartphone Integrated with Liposome&#8208;Encapsulated Curcumin for Onsite Visual Ratiometric Fluorescence Imaging of Hypochlorite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering of ClO&#8722; stimuli&#8208;responsive CCM&#8208;encapsulated liposome, a smartphone&#8208;assisted portable sensor for visual point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of ClO&#8722; was developed. Compared with other reported ratiometric fluorescent methods, the proposed ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe [Ru(bpy)3]2+@CCM&#8208;NPs exhibits a wider linear range and even higher sensitivity for ClO&#8722; detection. Moreover, the portable sensor demonstrated high practicality in real samples.







Abstract
Precisely onsite monitoring of hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;) is of great significance to guide its rational use, reducing/avoiding its potential threat toward food safety and human health. Considering ClO&#8722; could quench fluorescence of curcumin (CCM) by oxidizing the o&#8208;methoxyphenol of CCM into benzoquinone, a portable ratiometric fluorescence sensor integrated with smartphone was designed for realizing the visual point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of ClO&#8722;. The amphiphilic phospholipid polymer was used as carrier to wrap curcumin, forming a novel liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM, which provided a scaffold to bind with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ through electrostatic interaction, thus assembling [Ru(bpy)3]2+&#8208;functionalized liposome&#8208;encapsulated CCM ([Ru(bpy)3]2+@CCM&#8208;NPs). Further integrated with smartphone, visual imaging of [Ru(bpy)3]2+@CCM&#8208;NPs could be achieved and the accurate onsite detection of ClO&#8722; could be realized with a detection limit of 66.31&#8197;nM and a linear range of 0.2210 to 80.0&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, the sensor could monitor ClO&#8722; in real samples with an onsite detection time of &#8764;154.0&#8197;s.

         <title>Tetranuclear Dicationic Aurophilic Gold(I) Catalysts in Enyne Cycloisomerization: Cooperativity for a Dramatic Shift in Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In comparison to mononuclear gold Lewis&#8208;acid catalysts, digold complexes and dual&#8208;gold catalysis have illustrated a distinct and powerful potential for the activation of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds. Herein, we pushed this concept further by designing novel tetranuclear gold(I) dicationic complexes structurally supported by strongly stabilizing constraint diphosphinoferrocenyl ligands and attractive closed&#8208;shell Au&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Au aurophilic interactions. The use of a molecularly&#8208;defined tetranuclear dicationic aurophilic gold(I) precatalyst for the selectivity&#8208;challenging cycloisomerization of low&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes favors the formation with high selectivity of strained azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;enes &#8211;even in the complete absence of activating/orienting substituents on alkyne and olefin reactive functions. This selectivity is not achieved by the reported phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;stabilized mono&#8208; and dinuclear cationic gold(I) complexes, including the ones formed from the same ligands. More importantly this selectivity differs also from nanoparticles and heterogeneous gold catalysts reported to date. DFT studies correlated to experimental mechanistic investigations support an unprecedented &#8220;cluster&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity from polynuclear cooperation at the origin of this peculiar selectivity where the aurophilic interactions preexist, and pre&#8208;organize, gold cluster reactive intermediates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A cage&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101)&#160; with&#160; biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid was synthesized&#160; via solvothermal method. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octanuclear nickel&#8208;clusters&#160; that are connected with each other by the 4&#8208;connected bptc  4&#8208;  &#160;ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed&#8208;metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of M  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101&#160;(M = Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The &#160;electrochemical &#160;studies&#160; showed that the&#160; hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)&#160;activity of&#160; Cu  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101 is much higher than that of other&#160;M  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101&#160;catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the&#160; bimetallic centers. The optimized &#160; Cu  0.19  Ni  0.81  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101  &#160;  has an overpotential&#160;of 324 mV at&#160;10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a Tafel slope of 131&#160;mV&#160;dec  &#8208;1  .

         <dc:description>The development of convenient new methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly desirable. Herein, we report a practical method for dehydroxyazidation of alcohols via an S  N  2 pathway involving PPh  3  and trifunctional benziodazolone&#8208;based hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents, which function as an electrophilic center, an azido source, and a base. We successfully used this mild, chemoselective method for late&#8208;stage azidation of structurally complex alcohols, as well as for a new synthetic route to the antiepileptic drug rufinamide. We also investigated the reaction mechanism both experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8211;Silicon Bonds of Benzosilacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion into strained Si&#8208;C bonds of benzosilacyclobutanes, which provides an efficient method to access &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes.&#160; With a sterically hindered ligand, carbene insertion into the C(sp  3  )&#8208;Si bond of benzosilacyclobutanes occurred in excellent site&#8208; and enantioselectivity, while C(sp  2  )&#8208;Si bond insertion occurred selectively with less sterically hindered ligands. Reaction mechanism, in particular the roles of the chiral ligands in controlling the site&#8208;selectivity of the insertion reactions, are elucidated using hybrid density functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Irreversible inhibition of IspG, a target for the development of new antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of its MEcPP substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighbouring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we showed that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition, which might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Catalyst for Preparation of Thiophosphinates from Phosphine Oxides and Thiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF) or 2',5'&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1':4',1''&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4''&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF) under solvothermal conditions. These two COFs were further facilely developed as efficient photocatalytic platforms for the synthesis of thiophosphinates. Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibited better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability, and excellent recycling capacity for the preparation of thiophosphinates from P(O)H compounds and thiols compared to Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF. This methodology was further extended to the seamless gram&#8208;scale production of target phosphorothioate derivatives. The results demonstrate that COFs can provide a robust platform for developing metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, highly efficient, and reusable heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>An allyl uranium(IV) sandwich complex: are &#966; bonding interactions possible?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to explore head&#8208;to&#8208;head &#966; backbonding from uranium f&#8208;orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals was pursued. The coordination of anionic allyl groups to uranium was achieved via tethered anilide ligands, and the products were investigated using NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enylsilyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline ( LH ), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI  2  ( L1 )  2  ( 1 ), which was synthesized using the mono&#8208;deprotonated ligand [K][N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)silyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L1 ). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U( L2 )  2  ( 2 ) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but most consistent results came from the use of the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]  2  [N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enidesilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L2 ). This allyl&#8208;based sandwich complex was studied using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#966;) backbonding. The bonding between the U(IV) and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron donation from two&#8208;carbon&#8208;fragment localized electron density into empty f&#8208;orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles and activation volumes of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene dimerizations computed by the extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1 atm and high pressures up the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1 atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently&#8208;developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent receptor&#8208;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, that can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, that has been recently introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative  E  /  Z  photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the  Z  isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the  E  isomer to crosslinking binding of the  Z  isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Charge Transfer in Strongly Interacting Diphenothiazone&#8208;TCBD and Diphenothiazine&#8208;DCNQ Push&#8208;Pull Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three types of phenothiazines dimers (PTZ&#8208;PTZ,  1&#8211;3  ), covalently linked with one or two acetylene linkers, were synthesized by copper&#8208;mediated Eglinton and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions in excellent yields. The dimers  1&#8211;3  were further engaged in [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reactions with strong electron acceptors, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) to yield tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD,  1a&#8211;3a  ), and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ,  1b&#8211;3b  ) functionalized donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugates, respectively. The conjugates were examined by a series of spectral, computational, and electrochemical studies. Strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) leading to new optical transitions was witnessed in both series of D&#8208;A conjugates. In the case DCNQ derived D&#8208;A system  1b  , the optical coverage extended until 1200 nm in benzonitrile, making this a rare class of D&#8208;A ICT system. Multiple redox processes were witnessed in these D&#8208;A systems, and the frontier orbitals generated on DFT optimized structures further supported the ICT phenomenon. Photochemical studies performed using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies confirmed solvent polarity dependent excited state charge transfer and separation in these novel multi&#8208;modular D&#8208;A conjugates. The charge&#8208;separated state in benzonitrile lasted for 30  &#8211;  40 ps owing to the close proximity of the push&#8208;pull entities in these conjugates. The significance of diphenothiazine in wide&#8208;band optical capture all the way into the near&#8208;IR region and promoting ultrafast photoinduced charge separation in the D&#8208;A&#8208;D configured multi&#8208;modular systems were the direct outcome of the present study.</dc:description>

         <title>Cocrystal Formation Precedes the Mechanochemically Acetate&#8208;Assisted C&#8211;H Activation with [Cp*RhCl2]2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we studied experimentally the mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 in the presence of NaOAc. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8211;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.</dc:description>

         <title>Different Topologies of Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine 1D Coordination Polymers: Dynamic Behaviour in Solvent Adsorption and Exchange Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) featuring three different topologies, comprising zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane structures, were obtained by reaction of Hg(II) ions with a novel bispidine ligand  L3  , and structurally characterized by SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD methods. The CPs obtained in the form of microcrystalline powders were tested for their ability to undergo solvent adsorption and exchange by P&#8208;XRD and  1  H&#8208;NMR. The extent of their dynamic behavior was then correlated to their structural features, highlighting the role of interchain interactions established among their constituting linear arrays. Zig&#8208;zag CPs proved to be resilient to external chemical stimuli, while they differently respond to thermal treatments, depending on the solvent originally included within the CP. In the case of polycatenated structure, we observed transformations where the original topology was maintained upon guest exchange, but also cases where it changed to zig&#8208;zag, even under solid/vapour conditions (  i.e.  , no complete dissolution of the CP). Given the presence of linear interconnected 1D channels,  3&#8729;ClBz&#8208;polycatenane  Pwd  is also able to trap volatile guests such as  n  &#8208;hexane when exposed to its vapours.</dc:description>

         <title>On the existence and role of formaldehyde during aqueous electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol by cobalt phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;time challenge in aqueous CO2 electrochemical reduction is to catalyze the formation of products beyond carbon monoxide with selectivity. Formaldehyde is the simplest of these products and one of the most relevant due to its broad use in the industry. Paradoxically it is one of the less reported product. Such scarcity may be in part explained by difficult identification and quantification using conventional chromatography or proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Likewise, indirect detection methods are usually not compatible with labelled study for asserting product origin. Recently, the possible production of formaldehyde during electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol at cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst in basic media has been the object of contradictory reports. Applying an analytical procedure based on proton NMR along with labelled studies, we provide definitive evidence for HCHO formation. We have further identified the possible scenarios for methanol formation through formaldehyde and revealed that the formation of the intermediate and its subsequent reduction are taking place at the same single active site. These studies open a new perspective to improve selectivity toward formaldehyde formation and to develop a subsequent chemistry based on reacting it with nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: from Discrete Molecular Catalysts to Their Integrated Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular catalysts (metal complexes), with molecularly defined uniform active sites and atomically precise structural tailorability allowing for regulating catalytic performance through metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered engineering and elucidating reaction mechanisms via routine photoelectrochemical characterizations, have been increasingly explored for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR). However, their poor stability and low catalytic current density are undesirable for practical applications. Heterogenizing discrete molecular catalysts can potentially surmount these issues and the resulting integrated catalysts largely share catalytical properties with their discrete molecular counterparts, which bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and combine their advantages. This minireview surveys advances in design and regulation of molecular catalysts such as porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and bipyridine&#8208;based metal complexes and their integrated catalytic materials for selective ECR.</dc:description>
