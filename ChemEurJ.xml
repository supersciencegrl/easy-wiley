      <title>Strategies for 1H&#8208;detected dynamic nuclear polarisation magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR</title>
      <dc:description>Combining dynamic nuclear polarization with proton detection significantly enhances the sensitivity of magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of proton&#8208; detected experiments with slow (10 kHz) magic angle spinning. The improvement in sensitivity permits the acquisition of indirectly detected &#160;14N spectra allowing biomolecular structures to be characterized without recourse to isotope labelling. This provides a new tool for the structural characterization of environmental and medical samples where isotope labelling is frequently intractable.</dc:description>

      <title>Photochemistry in real space: batho&#8208; and hypsochromism in the water dimer</title>
      <dc:description>The development of chemical intuition in photochemistry faces several difficulties which result from the inadequacy of the one&#8208;particle picture, the Born&#8208;Oppenheimer approximation, and other basic notions used to build models. We show herein how real space approaches can be efficiently used to get valuables insights in photochemistry via a simple example of red and blue shift effects: the double hypso&#8208; and bathochromic shift in the low&#8208;lying valence excited states of (H2O) 2 . We demonstrate that (i) the use of these techniques allows to maintain the perturbative language used in the theory of intermolecular interactions even in the strongly interacting short&#8208;range regime; (ii) that it is one and only one molecule that gets photoexcited in each of the addressed excited states and (iii) that the electrostatic interaction

between the in&#8208;the&#8208;cluster molecular dipoles provides a fairly intuitive rationalization of the observed batho&#8208; and hypsochromism. The methods exploited and illustrated in this paper are able to maintain the individuality as well as the properties of the interacting entities in a molecular aggregate, and thereby they allow to keep and build chemical intuition in general states, at any geometry and using a broad variety of electronic structure methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Molecular Chirality in Classical Spacetime: Solving the Controversy about the Spinning Cone Model of Rotating Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
The spinning cone is a model of rotating molecules used by Barron in 1986 in relation to asymmetric synthesis and to parity violation. He considered that the non&#8208;translating cone spinning about its symmetry axis has false chirality (i.e., it is not chiral), whereas Mislow concluded in 1999 that it is indeed chiral and severely criticized the true versus false chirality nomenclature introduced by Barron, who still disagreed in 2013 with the conclusion of Mislow. In his Concept article on page&#8197;10648&#8197;ff., M. Petitjean discusses this disagreement and concludes that the controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and that, in fact, both authors were right. In addition, light is thrown on the true chirality versus false chirality controversy with a very recently published result, which was unavailable to both authors: this is a new definition of chirality that encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin at the end of the 19th century.

      <dc:description>
The salient features and the upcoming applications of non&#8208;planar conjugated organic molecules (NPCOMs) that have been reported in the recent past are reported. The NPCOMs were segregated into Fused and Rotatable categories to explain how molecular features influence their electronic character and applications. Through the selected literature examples, it was brought out that the molecular asymmetry in NPCOMs endows them with certain unique physical, chemical and photophysical properties that are endeared in advanced applications such as organic electronics, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), spintronics, organic ferroelectrics, light harvesting, sensing and bioimaging.

      <title>In situ Mass Spectrometric and Kinetic Investigations of Soai's Asymmetric Autocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reactions that lead to a spontaneous symmetry breaking or amplification of the enantiomeric excess are of fundamental interest in explaining the formation of a homochiral world. An outstanding example is Soai&#8217;s asymmetric autocatalysis, in which small enantiomeric excesses of the added product alcohol are amplified in the reaction of diisopropylzinc and pyrimidine&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes. The exact mechanism is still in dispute due to complex reaction equilibria and elusive intermediates. In situ high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometric measurements, detailed kinetic analyses and doping with in situ reacting reaction mixtures, show the transient formation of hemiacetal complexes, which can establish an autocatalytic cycle. We propose a mechanism that explains the autocatalytic amplification involving these hemiacetal complexes. Comprehensive kinetic experiments and modelling of the hemiacetal formation and the Soai reaction allow the precise prediction of the reaction progress, the enantiomeric excess as well as the enantiomeric excess dependent time shift in the induction period. Experimental structural data give insights into the privileged properties of the pyrimidyl units and the formation of diastereomeric structures leading to an efficient amplification of even minimal enantiomeric excesses, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Cubane, Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane and Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane: Impact and Thermal Sensitiveness of Carboxyl&#8208;, Hydroxymethyl&#8208; and Iodo&#8208;substituents</title>
      <dc:description>
Fire and bicy: The thermal and impact sensitiveness of a series of carboxy&#8208;, hydroxymethyl&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;substituted cages were examined through sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry and hammer impact tests. The results reveal that these often&#8208;popular synthetic intermediates and functional groups can present some safety issues if not handled, stored, or used with care.







Abstract
With the burgeoning interest in cage motifs for bioactive molecule discovery, and the recent disclosure of 1,4&#8208;cubane&#8208;dicarboxylic acid impact sensitivity, more research into the safety profiles of cage scaffolds is required. Therefore, the impact sensitivity and thermal decomposition behavior of judiciously selected starting materials and synthetic intermediates of cubane, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (BCO) were evaluated via hammer test and sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. Iodo&#8208;substituted systems were found to be more impact sensitive, whereas hydroxymethyl substitution led to more rapid thermodecomposition. Cubane was more likely to be impact sensitive with these substituents, followed by BCP, whereas all BCOs were unresponsive. The majority of derivatives were placed substantially above Yoshida thresholds&#8212;a computational indicator of sensitivity.

      <title>Generating Excess Protons in Microsolvated Acid Clusters under Ambient Conditions: An Issue of Configurational Entropy versus Internal Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Temperature dependent: Extensive ab initio path integral simulations disclose that the number of water molecules required to allow for acid dissociation, and thus for the generation of hydrated excess protons, in restricted aqueous environments such as finite HCl(H2O)n clusters, is temperature dependent.







Abstract
Acid dissociation, and thus liberation of excess protons in small water droplets, impacts on diverse fields such as interstellar, atmospheric or environmental chemistry. At cryogenic temperatures below 1&#8197;K, it is now well established that as few as four water molecules suffice to dissociate the generic strong acid HCl, yet temperature&#8208;driven recombination sets in simply upon heating that cluster. Here, the fundamental question is posed of how many more water molecules are required to stabilize a hydrated excess proton at room temperature. Ab initio path integral simulations disclose that not five, but six water molecules are needed at 300&#8197;K to allow for HCl dissociation independently from nuclear quantum effects. In order to provide the molecular underpinnings of these observations, the classical and quantum free energy profiles were decomposed along the dissociation coordinate in terms of the corresponding internal energy and entropy profiles. What decides in the end about acid dissociation, and thus ion pair formation, in a specific microsolvated water cluster at room temperature is found to be a fierce competition between classical configurational entropy and internal energy, where the former stabilizes the undissociated state whereas the latter favors dissociation. It is expected that these are generic findings with broad implications on acid&#8211;base chemistry depending on temperature in small water assemblies.

      <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Multiple Roles of Oleic Acid in the Oil&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Pt Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Oleic acid (OAc) is commonly used as a surfactant and/or solvent for the oil&#8208;phase synthesis of metal nanocrystals but its explicit roles are yet to be resolved. Here we report a systematic study of this problem by focusing on a synthesis that simply involves heating of Pt(acac)  2  in OAc for the generation of Pt nanocrystals. When heated at 80  o  C, the ligand exchange between Pt(acac)  2  and OAc leads to the formation of a Pt  II  &#8211;oleate complex that serves as the actual precursor to Pt atoms. Upon increasing the temperature to 120  o  C, the decarbonylation of OAc produces CO, which can act as a reducing agent for the generation of Pt atoms and thus formation of nuclei. Afterwards, several catalytic reactions can take place on the surface of the Pt nuclei to produce more CO, which also serves as a capping agent for the formation of Pt nanocrystals enclosed by {100} facets. The emergence of Pt nanocrystals further promotes the autocatalytic surface reduction of Pt  II  precursor to enable the continuation of growth. This work not only elucidates the critical roles of OAc at different stages in a synthesis of Pt nanocrystals but also represents a pivotal step forward toward the rational synthesis of metal nanocrystals.</dc:description>

The absolute configuration of the enantiomers was assigned by comparison of the circular dichroism spectra with quantum mechanical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Chatt&#8208;type Catalyst&#160;with One Coordination Site&#160;for Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract: With [Mo(N2)(P2MePP2Ph)] the first Chatt&#8208;type complex with one coordination site catalytically converting N2 to ammonia is presented. Employing SmI2 as reductant and H2O as proton source 26 equivalents of ammonia are generated. Analogous Mo(0)&#8208;N2 complexes supported by a combination of bi&#8208; and tridentate phosphine ligands are catalytically inactive under the same conditions. These findings are interpreted by analyzing structural and spectroscopic features of the employed systems, leading to the conclusion that the catalytic activity of the title complex is due to the strong activation of N2 and the unique topology of the pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) ligand P2MePP2Ph. The analogous hydrazido(2&#8208;) complex [Mo(NNH2)(P2MePP2Ph)](BArF)2 is generated by protonation with HBArF in ether and characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy. Importantly, it is shown to be catalytically active as well. Along with the fact that the structure of the title complex precludes dimerization this demonstrates that the corresponding catalytic cycle follows a mononuclear pathway. The implications of a PCET mechanism on this reactive scheme are considered.</dc:description>

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of Formate Dehydrogenase for Regeneration of a Non&#8208;Natural Redox Cofactor</title>
      <dc:description>Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) has been widely used for the regeneration of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). To utilize nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) as a non&#8208;natural redox cofactor, it remains challenging as NCDH, the reduced form of NCD, has to be efficiently regenerated. Here we demonstrate successful engineering of FDH for NCDH regeneration. Guided by the structural information of FDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (pseFDH) and the NAD&#8208;pseFDH complex, semi&#8208;rational strategies were applied to design mutant libraries and screen for NCD&#8208;linked activity. The most active mutant reached a cofactor preference switch from NAD to NCD by 3700&#8208;fold. Homology modeling analysis showed that these mutants had reduced cofactor binding pockets and dedicated hydrophobic interactions for NCD. Efficient regeneration of NCDH was implemented by powering an NCD&#8208;dependent D&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase for stoichiometric and stereospecific reduction of pyruvate to D&#8208;lactate at the expense of formate.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of the PHY domain on the photoisomerization step of the forward Pr &#8594; Pfr conversion of a knotless phytochrome</title>
      <dc:description>Phytochrome photoreceptors operate via photoisomerization of a bound bilin chromophore. Their typical architecture consists of GAF, PAS and PHY domains. Knotless phytochromes lack the PAS domain, while retaining photoconversion abilities, with some being able to photoconvert with just the GAF domain. Therefore, we investigated the ultrafast photoisomerization of the P  r  state of a knotless phytochrome to reveal the effect of the PHY domain and its &#8216;tongue&#8217; region on the transduction of the light signal. We show that the PHY domain does not affect the initial conformational dynamics of the chromophore. However, it significantly accelerates the consecutively induced reorganizational dynamics of the protein, necessary for the progression of the photoisomerization. Consequently, the PHY domain keeps the bilin and its binding pocket in a more reactive conformation, which reduces the extent of protein reorganization required for the chromophore isomerization. Thereby, less energy is lost along non&#8208;productive reaction pathways, resulting in increased efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid Access to Azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes via a tandem diverted Tsuji&#8208;Trost process</title>
      <dc:description>A three&#8208;step synthesis of the 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system from simple pyrroles, employing a combined photochemical/palladium&#8208;catalyzed approach is reported.

Structural hybridization of bioactive heterocycles is a promising tool to develop new efficient therapeutics for the treatment of various diseases including viral infections. The merging of two differently acting heterocycles&#8212;artemisinin and isoquinoline&#8212;in one hybrid molecule results in the discovery of a new and potent antiviral agent, which exceeds parent compounds in anti&#8208;HCMV and anti&#8208;HBV activities and is even able to outperform the clinically used drug ganciclovir.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Resorcin[4]arene Cavitands: Toward Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Molecular Grippers</title>
      <dc:description>
Resorcin[4]arene cavitands can be switched between a kite conformation, adopted in the dark, and a vase conformation, generated under visible light irradiation. The switching is triggered by the formation of a semiquinone radical anion through a photosensitizing process. The large conformational rearrangement of the cavitands resembles the mechanical switching occurring in some flowers that bloom open in the evening and close during the day (cover design: Ella Maru Studio). More information can be found in the Full Paper by V. Garc&#237;a&#8208;L&#243;pez, F.&#8197;Diederich, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001788).

The propossed mechanism for the electron transfer process has been well&#8208;supported by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies and DFT calculations. The solid state oligomerization process has been observed to be largely dependent on the ionic radii of alkali metal ions, steric bulk of cAAC ligands and solvation/de&#8208;solvation/recombination of the dimeric unit [(cAAC)P&#8208;M(THF)x]2.</dc:description>

The propossed mechanism for the electron transfer process has been well&#8208;supported by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies and DFT calculations. The solid state oligomerization process has been observed to be largely dependent on the ionic radii of alkali metal ions, steric bulk of cAAC ligands and solvation/de&#8208;solvation/recombination of the dimeric unit [(cAAC)P&#8208;M(THF)x]2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Stabilization of triplet biradical intermediate of 5&#8208;methylcytosine enhances cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation in DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is a photoproduct formed by two stacked pyrimidine bases via a cycloaddition reaction upon irradiation. Due to its close association with skin cancer, the mechanism of CPD formation has been studied thoroughly. Among many aspects of CPD, its formation involving 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) has been of special interest because CPD yield is known to increase by C5&#8208;methylation of cytosine. In this work, we use high level QM/MM calculations to examine a previously experimentally detected pathway for CPD formation in hetero (thymine&#8208;cytosine and thymine&#8208;5mC) dipyrimidines that is facilitated through intersystem crossing in thymine and formation of a triplet biradical intermediate. A DNA duplex model system containing a core sequence TmCG or TCG is used. We demonstrate that the stabilization of a radical center in the biradical intermediate by the methyl group of 5mC can lead to increased CPD yield in TmCG compared to its non&#8208;methylated counterpart, TCG, thereby suggesting the existence of a new pathway of CPD formation enhanced by 5mC.</dc:description>

      <title>Edge Functionalized Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>Nanographenes (NGs) have recently emerged as new carbon materials. Their nanoscale size results in a size&#8208;dependent quantum confinement effect, opening the band gap by a few eV. This energy gap allows NGs to be applied as optical materials. This property has attracted researchers across multiple scientific fields. The photophysical properties of NGs can be manipulated by introducing organic groups onto their basal planes and/or into their edges. In addition, the integration of organic functional groups into NGs results in NG&#8208;based hybrid materials. These features make the postsynthetic modification of NGs an active research area. Since obtainable information on chemically functionalized NGs is limited due to their nonstoichiometry and structural uncertainty, their structural characterization requires a combination of multiple spectroscopic methods. Therefore, information on the characterization procedures of recently published chemically functionalized NGs is of value for advancing the field of NG&#8208;based hybrid materials. The present review focuses on the structural characterization of chemically functionalized NGs. We hope this review will help to advance this field.</dc:description>

      <title>A Streamlined Regenerative Glycosylation Reaction: Direct, Acid&#8208;Free Activation of Thioglycosides</title>
      <dc:description>Our group has previously reported that 3,3&#8208;difluoroxindole (HOFox) is able to mediate glycosylations via intermediacy of OFox imidates. Thioglycoside precursors were first converted into the corresponding glycosyl bromides that were then converted into the OFox imidates in the presence of Ag  2  O followed by the activation with catalytic Lewis acid in a regenerative fashion. Reported herein is a direct conversion of thioglycosides via the regenerative approach that bypasses the intermediacy of bromides and eliminates the need for heavy metal&#8208;based promoters. The direct regenerative activation of thioglycosides is achieved under neural reaction conditions using only 1 equiv NIS and catalytic HOFox without the acidic additives</dc:description>

The direct regenerative activation of thioglycosides is achieved under neural reaction conditions using only 1 equiv NIS and catalytic HOFox without the acidic additives&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Acidic monosaccharides become incorporated into calcite single crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrates, along with proteins and peptides, are known to represent a major class of biomacromolecules involved in calcium carbonate biomineralization. However, in spite of multiple physical or biochemical characterizations, the explicit role of saccharide macromolecules (long chains of carbohydrate molecules) is not yet understood in mineral deposition. In the present study we investigated the influence of two common acidic monosaccharides (MSs), which are the simplest form of carbohydrates and are represented here by glucuronic and galacturonic acids, on the formation of calcite crystals  in vitro  . We show that the size, morphology and microstructure of calcite crystals are altered when they are grown in the presence of these MSs. More importantly, MSs were found to become incorporated into the calcite crystalline lattice and induce anisotropic lattice distortions, a widely studied phenomenon in other biomolecules related to CaCO  3  biomineralization but never before reported in the case of single MSs. Changes in the calcite lattice induced by MS incorporation were precisely determined by the technique of high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. We believe that the results of this research may deepen our understanding of the interaction of saccharide polymers with an inorganic host and shed light on the implications of carbohydrates for biomineralization processes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Water&#8208;Gated Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistor for Glyphosate Detection: A Comparative Study with Fluorescence Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>We here propose a design of a highly sensitive solid&#8208;state sensor device based on a water&#8208;gated organic thin&#8208;film transistor (WG&#8208;OTFT) for the selective detection of herbicide glyphosate (GlyP) in water. A competitive assay among carboxylate&#8208;functionalized polythiophene, Cu  2+  , and GlyP was employed as a sensing mechanism. Molecular recognition phenomena and electrical double layer (EDL) (at the polymer/water interface) originated from the field&#8208;effect worked cooperatively to amplify the sensitivity for GlyP. The limit of detection of WG&#8208;OTFT (0.26 ppm) was lower than that of a fluorescence sensor chip (0.95 ppm) which are conventional sensing methods. In contrast to the previously reported insulated molecular wires to block interchain interactions, molecular aggregates under the field&#8208;effect has shown to be effective for amplification of sensitivity through &#8220;intra&#8221;&#8208; and &#8220;inter&#8221;&#8208;molecular wire effects.

      <title>Simple Synthesis of a Heterocyclophane Exhibiting Anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met Activity by Acting as a Hatch Blocking Access to the Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>A simple approach to the synthesis of heterocyclophane consisting of two 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bithiazoles has been developed in mild conditions. The heterocyclophane with two short chains was conveniently prepared by Hantzsch thiazoles synthesis using the reaction of 3&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxycarbonyl&#8208;3&#8208;azapentanethiocarboxamide with 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione in methanol under reflux for only 15 minutes. Amino groups at the linkers of this heterocyclophane can be functionalized to give acylated and carbamate derivatives. Their properties as protein kinase inhibitors were investigated, and one of the heterocyclophanes exhibited specific c&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) anti&#8208;activity (IC  50  = 603 nM) among 7 types of protein kinases investigated. The computational site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method was used to determine why the one heterocyclophane exhibited strong anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Elucidating Atropisomerism in Nonplanar Porphyrins with Tunable Supramolecular Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Atropisomerism is a fundamental feature of substituted biaryls resulting from rotation around the biaryl axis. Different stereoisomers are formed due to restricted rotation about the single bond, a situation often found in substituted porphyrins. Previously NMR determination of porphyrin atropisomers proved difficult, if not almost impossible to accomplish, due to low resolution or unresolvable resonance signals that predominantly overlapped. Here, we shed some light on this fundamental issue found in porphyrinoid stereochemistry. Using benzenesulfonic acid (BSA) for host&#8211;guest interactions and performing 1D, 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, we were able to characterize all four rotamers of the nonplanar 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18&#8208;octaethylporphyirin as restricted H&#8208;bonding complexes. Additionally, X&#8208;ray structural analysis was used to investigate aspects of the weak host&#8211;guest interactions. A detailed assignment of the chemical signals suggests charge&#8208;assisted complexation as a key to unravel the atropisomeric enigma. From a method development perspective, symmetry operations unique to porphyrin atropisomers offer an essential handle to accurately identify the rotamers using NMR techniques only.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrafast Charge Delocalization Dynamics of Ambient Stable CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Encapsulated in Polystyrene Fiber</title>
      <dc:description>CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) encapsulated in a transparent polystyrene (PS) fiber matrix (CsPbBr3@PS) has been synthesized to protect the NCs. The ultrafast charge delocalization dynamics of the embedded NCs has been demonstrated, and the results are compared with the pristine CsPbBr3 in toluene. Electrospinning method was employed for the preparation of CsPbBr3@PS fibers using the polystyrene solution doped with pre&#8208;synthesized CsPbBr3 and characterized by XRD, HRTEM and XPS. Energy level diagram of CsPbBr3 and PS suggest that CsPbBr3@PS fibers make a type&#8208;I core&#8208;shell structure. The carrier cooling for CsPbBr3@PS fiber is found to be much slower as compared to pure CsPbBr3 NCs. This observation suggests that photo&#8208;excited electrons from CsPbBr3 NCs get de&#8208;localized from conduction band of perovskite to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PS fiber matrix. The CsPbBr3@PS fibers possess remarkable stability under ambient condition as well as in water over months. The clear understanding of charge carrier relaxation dynamics of CsPbBr3 while confined in PS fiber could help to design robust optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

The carrier cooling for CsPbBr3@PS fiber is found to be much slower as compared to pure CsPbBr3 NCs. This observation suggests that photo&#8208;excited electrons from CsPbBr3 NCs get de&#8208;localized from conduction band of perovskite to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PS fiber matrix. The CsPbBr3@PS fibers possess remarkable stability under ambient condition as well as in water over months. The clear understanding of charge carrier relaxation dynamics of CsPbBr3 while confined in PS fiber could help to design robust optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Intrinsic Contributions of 2&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxyl to the Hydration of Nucleoside at Monomeric Level</title>
      <dc:description>Although many reports have revealed the structural differences between DNA and RNA at the polymeric level, there is no comparative studies with 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside and ribonucleoside to explore the roles of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group at the monomeric level under the same conditions. Inspired by these, in this work, the intrinsic contributions of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group in nucleoside have been systematically investigated by directly solving the single crystal structures of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenosine (  1  ), 2&#8208;aminoadenosine (  2  ), and 2&#8208;aminoarabinofuranosyladenine (  3  ) in water. Interestingly,  1  , which does not contain the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH group, displayed strong hydration, while  2  and  3  exhibited no hydration, which is completely different to that observed in nucleic acids. Meanwhile we found that compound 1 can lock the water molecules to form unique trihydrol moieties, which further serve as the backbone to construct, to our best knowledge, the simplest double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;like structures. To this end, in order to investigate the effect of the biological environment on these unique structures, the solvent was changed from water to phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS). Surprisingly, such a subtle adjustment led to entirely different superstructures, consisting of two&#8208;dimensional lamellar structures in water and three&#8208;dimensional porous structures in PBS. These large morphological differences could be attributed to delicate ion hydration, which was also confirmed using variable temperature X&#8208;ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and intermolecular interaction energy calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning of Morphology by Chirality in Self&#8208;Assembled Structures of Bis(Urea) Amphiphiles in Water</title>
      <dc:description>We present the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of a chiral bis(urea) amphiphile and show that chirality offers a remarkable level of control towards different morphologies. Upon self&#8208;assembly in water, the molecular scale chiral information is translated to the mesoscopic level. Both enantiomers of the amphiphile self&#8208;assemble into chiral twisted ribbons with opposite handedness, as supported by Cryo&#8208;TEM and CD measurements. The system presents thermo&#8208;responsive aggregation behaviour and combined transmittance measurements, temperature dependent UV, CD, TEM and micro&#8208;DSC show that a ribbon&#8208;to&#8208;vesicles transition occurs upon heating. Remarkable, chirality allows easy control of morphology as the self&#8208;assembly into distinct aggregates can be tuned by varying the enantiomeric excess of the amphiphile, giving access to flat sheets, helical ribbons, and twisted ribbons.</dc:description>

      <title>Bioinspired Scaffolding by Supramolecular Amines Allows the Formation of One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Dimensional Silica Superstructures</title>
      <dc:description>Silica materials attract an increasing amount of interest and find applications in e.g. sensing, catalysis, and drug delivery. As the properties of silica nanomaterials not only depend on their chemistry but also their size, shape, and surface area, the controllable synthesis of silica is essential for tailoring the materials to specific applications. Advantageously, bioinspired routes for silica production are environmental&#8208;friendly and straightforward since the formation process is spontaneous and proceeds under mild conditions. These strategies mostly employ amine&#8208;bearing phosphorylated (bio)polymers. In this work, we expand this principle to supramolecular polymers based on the water&#8208;soluble cationic cyanine dye Pinacyanol acetate. Upon assembly, these dyes form large, polyaminated, supramolecular fibers. The surfaces of these fibers can be used as a scaffold for the condensation of silicic acid. Control over the ionic strength, dye concentration, and silicic acid saturation yielded silica fibers with a diameter of 25 nm and a single, 4 nm pore.&#160; Unexpectedly, other unusual superstructures, namely, nummulites and spherulites, were also found. SAXS and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy revealed ionic strength and dye concentration hardly affect the morphology of the supramolecular scaffold. TIRF unraveled that under static conditions, only silica fibers are obtained. This evidenced that the marked structural diversity originates from the shear&#8208;induced arrangement of silica/dye fibers. Under these mild conditions, external force fields have a profound influence on silica morphology.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the time scale of conformational plasticity and allostery in glycan recognition by human galectin&#8208;1.</title>
      <dc:description>The interaction of human galectin&#8208;1 with a variety of oligosaccharides, from di&#8208; (N&#8208;acetyllactosamine) to tetra&#8208;saccharides (blood B type&#8208;II antigen) has been scrutinized by using a combined approach of different NMR experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Ligand&#8208; and receptor&#8208;based NMR experiments assisted by computational methods allowed proposing three&#8208;dimensional structures for the different complexes, which explained the lack on enthalpy gain when increasing the chemical complexity of the glycan. Interestingly, and independently of the glycan ligand, the entropy term does not oppose the binding event, a rather unusual feature for protein&#8208;sugar interactions. CLEANEX&#8208;PM and relaxation dispersion experiments revealed that sugar binding affected residues far from the binding site and described significant changes in the dynamics of the protein. In particular, motions in the microsecond&#8208;millisecond timescale in residues at the protein dimer interface were identified in the presence of high affinity ligands. The dynamic process was further explored by extensive MD simulations, which provided additional support for the existence of allostery in glycan recognition by human galectin&#8208;1.</dc:description>

      <title>Cannabidiol Discovery and Synthesis A Target&#8208;Oriented Analysis in Drug Production Process</title>
      <dc:description>The current state of evidence and recommendations for cannabidiol (CBD) and its health effects change the legal landscape and aim to destigmatize its phytotherapeutic research. Recently, some countries have included CBD as an antiepileptic product for compassionate use in children with refractory epilepsy. The growing demand of CBD leads to the need for high purity cannabinoids for the emerging market. The discovery and development of approaches toward cannabidiol synthesis have arisen from the successful extraction of  Cannabis  plants for cannabinoid fermentation in brewer&#8217;s yeast. To understand the different contributions to CBD synthesis and its key intermediates, design, and enhancement, we offer a detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization.</dc:description>

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Resorcin[4]arene Cavitands: Toward Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Molecular Grippers</title>
      <dc:description>
Kite in a vase: Resorcin[4]arene cavitands functionalized with an electron&#8208;accepting quinone and a [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) photosensitizing wall can be switched upon visible&#8208;light irradiation between a flat kite in the quinone state Q and a vase conformation in the semiquinone radical anion state SQ. Conformational switching can also be triggered by changes in solvent or host&#8211;guest interactions.







Abstract
Resorcin[4]arene cavitands, equipped with diverse quinone (Q) and [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) photosensitizing walls in different configurations, were synthesized. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 420&#8197;nm, electron transfer from the [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ to the Q generates the semiquinone (SQ) radical anion, triggering a large conformational switching from a flat kite to a vase with a cavity for the encapsulation of small guests, such as cyclohexane and heteroalicyclic derivatives, in CD3CN. Depending on the molecular design, the SQ radical anion can live for several minutes (&#8776;10&#8197;min) and the vase can be generated in a secondary process without need for addition of a sacrificial electron donor to accumulate the SQ state. Switching can also be triggered by other stimuli, such as changes in solvent, host&#8211;guest complexation, and chemical and electrochemical processes. This comprehensive investigation benefits the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanodevices, such as light&#8208;activated molecular grippers.

      <title>Organoboron Derivatives of Stereoregular Phenylcyclosilsesquioxanes</title>

The synthesis of new precursors for producing HOFs: systems that are capable of reversible structure reorganization are reported. A simple and convenient method is described for creation of a new class of borosiloxane compounds by combination of a very flexible siloxane framework with fragments of boric acid derivatives. Organoboron derivatives of stereoregular phenylcyclosilsesquioxanes were obtained in high yields. Such compounds can be used for preparation of macro initiators and for synthesizing macromolecular scaffolds in Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

Chiral N,O&#8208;acetals could be easily prepared by asymmetric hydrogenation! Construction of this family of challenging molecules has never been a easy task, until this work. Under an acidic condition, acyl salicylamides undergo cyclization to form a cationic intermediate, which could be reduced by an iridium catalyst.

      <title>Analysis of solid&#8208;state luminescence emission amplification at substituted anthracenes by host&#8208;guest complex formation</title>
      <dc:description>Small robust organic molecules showing solid&#8208;state luminescence are promising candidates for optoelectronic materials. Herein, we investigate a series of diphenylphosphanyl anthracenes [9&#8208;PPh  2  &#8208;10&#8208;R&#8208;(C  14  H  8  )] and their sulfur oxidised analogues. The oxidation causes drastic changes in the molecular structure as the new orientation of the bulky (S)PPh  2  substituent induces a strong butterfly bent structure of the anthracene core, which triggers a strong bathochromic shift resulting in a green solid&#8208;state fluorescence. As the emission properties change only slightly upon aggregation the origin of the emission is attributed to a typical monomer fluorescence. The host&#8208;guest complexes of [9&#8208;(S)PPh  2  &#8208;10&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;(C  14  H  8  )] with four basic arenes reveal an emission enhancement up to five&#8208;times higher quantum yields compared to the pure host. Less interchromophoric interactions and a restriction of intramolecular motion within the host molecules due to fixation by weak C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions with the co&#8208;crystallised arene are responsible for that emission enhancement.</dc:description>

      <title>Doubly Boron&#8208;doped TADF Emitters Decorated with ortho&#8208;Donor Groups for Highly Efficient Green to Red OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>Doubly boron&#8208;doped thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on a 9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene (DBA) acceptor decorated with  ortho  &#8208;donor groups (Cz2  o  DBA,  2  ; BuCz2  o  DBA,  3  ; DMAC2  o  DBA,  4  ) are prepared to realize high&#8208;efficiency green&#8208;to&#8208;red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of  2  and  4  reveal the symmetrical and highly twisted  ortho  &#8208;donor&#8722;acceptor&#8722;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) structure of the emitters. The twisted conformation leads to a very small energy splitting (&#916;  E  ST  &lt; 0.08 eV) between the excited singlet and triplet states that gives rise to strong TADF, as supported by theoretical studies. Depending on the strength of the donor moieties, the emission color is fine&#8208;tuned in the visible region from green (  2  ) to yellow (  3  ) to red (  4  ). Carbazole&#8208;containing  2  and  3  exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) approaching 100%, whereas DMAC&#8208;substituted  4  is moderately emissive (PLQY = 44%) in a doped host film. Highly efficient green&#8208;to&#8208;red TADF&#8208;OLEDs are realized with the proposed  ortho  &#8208;D&#8722;A&#8722;D compounds as emitters. The green and yellow OLEDs incorporating Cz2  o  DBA (  2  ) and BuCz2  o  DBA (  3  ) emitters exhibit high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 26.6% and 21.6%, respectively. In particular, the green device shows an excellent power efficiency above 100 lm W  &#8722;1  . A red OLED fabricated with a DMAC2  o  DBA (  4  ) emitter exhibits a maximum EQE of 10.1% with an electroluminescence peak at 615 nm.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the high performance anode material of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O microrods wrapped by reduced graphene oxide for lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi&#8208;step solvo/hydro&#8208;thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4&#183;2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O. The CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO electrode delivers specific capacity of 1011.5 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles for lithium storage, and exhibits high capacity of 221.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles for sodium storage. Moreover, the full cell CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO//LiCoO2 consisted of the CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO anode and LiCoO2 cathode maintains 138.1 mA h g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 and has superior long&#8208;cycle stability. In addition, in&#8208;situ Raman, in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques have provided a unique opportunity to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO. This work also supplies a new perspective and certain research basis for the application of metal oxalate materials in high performance lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal oxalate has become a most promising anode candidate material for lithium&#8208;ion and sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there exists the problem of capacity decrease due to the volume expansion of the active material during cycling. Herein, the rodlike CoC2O4&#183;2H2O/rGO hybrid has been fabricated via a novel multi&#8208;step solvo/hydro&#8208;thermal strategy. The structure characteristic of microrod CoC2O4&#183;2H2O wrapped using rGO sheet not only inhibits the volume variation of the hybrid electrode during the cycle, but also accelerates the transfer of electrons and ions amongst the 3D graphene network, thereby improving the electrochemical properties of CoC2O4&#183;2H2O.

      <title>A Remarkable Fluorescence Quenching Based Amplification in ATP Detection through Signal Transduction in Self&#8208;assembled Multivalent Aggregates</title>
      <dc:description>Signal transduction is essential for the survival of living organisms as it allows them to respond to the changes in external environments. In artificial systems, signal transduction has been exploited for the highly sensitive detection of analytes. Herein, we report a remarkable signal transduction, upon ATP binding, in the multivalent fibrillar nanoaggregates of anthracene conjugated imidazolium receptors. The aggregates of one particular amphiphilic receptor sensed ATP in high pM concentrations with one ATP molecule essentially quenching the emission of thousands of receptors. A cooperative merging of the multivalent binding and signal transduction led to this superquenching and translated to an outstanding enhancement of more than a million&#8208;fold in the sensitivity of ATP detection by the nanoaggregates; in comparison to the &#8220;molecular&#8221; imidazolium receptors. Furthermore, an exceptional selectivity to ATP over other nucleotides was demonstrated .</dc:description>

A similar series of reactions was performed starting with anions  A  and  B  and 4&#8208;methoxystyryl bromide and iodide. Significant differences in the reactivity of derivatives of the two carborane anions were rationalized with DFT computational results. Application of the difunctionalized carboranes as building blocks was demonstrated through preparation of two ionic liquid crystals.

      <title>Sterically hindered derivative of the 2,1,3&#8208;benzotelluradiazole: a way to the first structurally characterized tellurium&#8208;nitrogen radical anion</title>

The solution EPR spectrum of [CoCp2  ]+  [  1  ]&#8208;&#183;  at room temperature features a quintet due to splitting on two equivalent  15  N nuclei. Below 150 K it turns into a broad singlet line with two weak satellites due to the splitting on the  125  Te nucleus. The two&#8208;component DFT calculations perfectly reproduce the a(15  N) HFI constants and  A II  (125  Te) value responsible for the low&#8208;temperature satellite splitting.
