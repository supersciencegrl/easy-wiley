      <title>What's in an atom? A comparison of carbon and silicon&#8208;centered amidinium&#183;&#183;&#183;carboxylate frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Despite their apparent similarity, framework materials based on tetraphenylmethane and tetraphenylsilane building blocks often have quite different structures and topologies. Herein, we describe a new silicon tetraamidinium compound and use it to prepare crystalline hydrogen bonded frameworks with carboxylate anions in water. The silicon&#8208;containing frameworks are compared with those prepared from the analogous carbon tetraamidinium: when biphenyldicarboxylate or tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)methane anions were used similar channel&#8208;containing networks are observed for both the silicon and carbon tetraamidinium. When terephthalate or bicarbonate anions were used, different products form. Insights into possible reasons for the different products are provided by a survey of the Cambridge Structural Database and quantum chemical calculations, both of which indicate that, contrary to expectations, tetraphenylsilane derivatives have less geometrical flexibility than tetraphenylmethane derivatives,  i.e.  they are less able to distort away from ideal tetrahedral bond angles.</dc:description>

      <title>Gold Metallodrugs to Target Coronavirus Proteins : Inhibitory Effects on the Spike&#8208;ACE2 Interaction and on PLpro Protease Activity by Auranofin and Gold Organometallics</title>
      <dc:description>Gold complexes have a long tradition in medicine and for many examples antirheumatic, anticancer or anti&#8208;infective effects have been confirmed. Here we evaluated the lead compound Auranofin and five selected gold organometallics as inhibitors of two relevant drug targets of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS&#8208;CoV). The gold metallodrugs were effective inhibitors of the interaction of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor and might thus interfere with the viral entry process. The gold metallodrugs were also efficient inhibitors of the papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;1 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, which is a key enzyme in the viral replication. Regarding PLpro from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the here reported inhibitors are among the very first experimentally confirmed examples with activity against this target enzyme. Importantly, the activity of the complexes against both PLpro enzymes correlated with the ability of the inhibitors to remove zinc ions from the labile zinc center of the enzyme. Taken together, the results of this pilot study suggest further evaluation of gold complexes as SARS&#8208;CoV antiviral drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Ambient Pressure Oxidation of Methane to Methanol Over Every Tri&#8208;Iron Node in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Material</title>
      <dc:description>In contrast with metal&#8208;modified zeolites, metal&#8208;organic framework materials (MOFs) provide a platform that may be significantly more amenable to creating catalysts in which every metal site is endowed with the same coordination environment, and hence, catalytic function. Using MIL&#8208;100(Fe) as a prototype, we present the first example of a synthetic heterogeneous catalyst comprised exclusively of active tri&#8208;iron moieties participating in the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of methane to methanol; in contrast with prior reports on iron&#8208;MOFs, we report the near&#8208;exclusive formation of methanol at low temperatures and sub&#8208;ambient methane pressures, and evidence its effectuation solely by Fe2+ sites. The study captures the utility of exploring classes of materials endowed with a high level of definition in structure and catalytic function for the purposes of overcoming persistent scientific and technological challenges in the field of synthetic heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;Planar Structures of Sterically Overcrowded Trialkylamines</title>
      <dc:description>Several amines with three bulky alkyl groups at the nitrogen atom, which exceed the steric crowding of triisopropylamine significantly, were synthesized, mainly by treating  N  &#8208;chlorodialkylamines with Grignard reagents. In six cases, namely  tert  &#8208;butyldiisopropylamine, 1&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylisopropylamine, di&#8208;1&#8208;adamantylamines with an additional  N  &#8208;cyclohexyl or  N  &#8208;  exo  &#8208;2&#8208;norbonyl substituent, as well as 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine derivatives with  N  &#8208;cyclohexyl or  N  &#8208;neopentyl groups, appropriate single crystals were generated that enabled X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and analysis of the molecular structures. The four noncyclic amines adopt triskele&#8208;like conformations, and the sum of the three C&#8211;N&#8211;C angles is always in the range of 351.1&#176; to 352.4&#176;. Consequently, these amines proved to be structurally significantly flatter than trialkylamines without steric congestion, which is also signalized by the smaller heights of the NC  3  pyramids (0.241&#8211;0.259 &#550;). There is no clear correlation between the heights of these pyramids and the degree of the steric crowding in the new amines, presumably because steric repulsion is partly compensated by dispersion interaction. In the cases of the two heterocyclic amines, the steric stress is smaller, and the molecular structures include quite different conformations. Quantum chemical calculations led to precise gas&#8208;phase structures of the sterically overcrowded trialkylamines exhibiting heights of the NC  3  pyramids and preferred molecular conformers which are similar to those resulting from the X&#8208;ray studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Dinitrogen Fixation: Rationalizing Strategies Utilizing Molecular Complexes.</title>
      <dc:description>Dinitrogen (N  2  ) is the most abundant gas in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but its inertness hinders its use as a nitrogen source in the biosphere and in industry. Efficient catalysts are hence required to overcome the high kinetic barriers associated to N  2  transformation. In that respect, molecular complexes have demonstrated strong potential to mediate N  2  functionalization reactions under mild conditions while providing a straightforward understanding of the reaction mechanisms. This review emphasizes the strategies for N  2  reduction and functionalization using molecular transition metal and actinide complexes according to their proposed reaction mechanisms, distinguishing complexes inducing cleavage of the N&#8801;N bond before (dissociative mechanism) or concomitantly with functionalization (associative mechanism). We present here the main examples of stoichiometric and catalytic N  2  functionalization reactions following these strategies.</dc:description>

We present here the main examples of stoichiometric and catalytic N  2  functionalization reactions following these strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Switching the Switch: Ligand Induced Disulfide Formation in HDAC8</title>
      <dc:description>
Regulated by a redox switch: PD&#8208;404,182 has been evaluated as an isoenzyme selective covalent inhibitor of HDAC8. HDAC8 belongs to the enzyme family of zinc&#8208;dependent histone deacetylases and is known to be regulated by a redox switch. The enzyme plays an important role in several cancer diseases and particularly childhood neuroblastoma. This study provides deep insight in how HDAC8 enzyme activity is regulated by disulfide bonds induced by PD&#8208;404,182.







Abstract
Human histone deacetylase 8 is a well&#8208;recognized target for T&#8208;cell lymphoma and particularly childhood neuroblastoma. PD&#8208;404,182 was shown to be a selective covalent inhibitor of HDAC8 that forms mixed disulfides with several cysteine residues and is also able to transform thiol groups to thiocyanates. Moreover, HDAC8 was shown to be regulated by a redox switch based on the reversible formation of a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys102 and Cys153. This study on the distinct effects of PD&#8208;404,182 on HDAC8 reveals that this compound induces the dose&#8208;dependent formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges. Therefore, the inhibition mechanism of HDAC8 by PD&#8208;404,182 involves both, covalent modification of thiols as well as ligand mediated disulfide formation. Moreover, this study provides a deep molecular insight into the regulation mechanism of HDAC8 involving several cysteines with graduated capability to form reversible disulfide bridges.

      <title>A Dendron&#8208;Based Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Probe for Tumor Detection</title>
      <dc:description>
Reductive response: A dendron&#8208;based fluorescence turn&#8208;on probe mediated by the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism is synthesized by conjugating one Cy5.5 molecule to the focal of a G3 dendron and eight Black Hole Quencher 3 (BHQ&#8208;3) molecules to its periphery through a reductively cleavable disulfide linkage. The fluorescence of the probe can be activated effectively and rapidly in the reductive environment of tumors.







Abstract
Specifically amplifying the emission signals of optical probes in tumors is an effective way to improve the tumor&#8208;imaging sensitivity and contrast. In this paper, the first case of dendron&#8208;based fluorescence turn&#8208;on probes mediated by a F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism is reported. Dendrons up to the fourth generation with a hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) scaffold are synthesized by a solid&#8208;phase synthesis strategy, and show precise and defect&#8208;free chemical structures. To construct the fluorescence turn&#8208;on probe, one Cy5.5 molecule is conjugated to the focal of a G3 dendron through a robust linkage and eight Black Hole Quencher 3 (BHQ&#8208;3) molecules are conjugated to its periphery through a PEG chain bearing a reductively cleavable disulfide linkage. By in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that the fluorescence of the dendron&#8208;based probe can be activated effectively and rapidly in the reductive environments of tumor cells and tissues, and the probe thus exhibits amplified tumor signals and weak normal tissue signals. Compared with the reported nanoscale turn&#8208;on probes, the dendron&#8208;based probe has several significant advantages, such as well&#8208;defined chemical structure, precisely controllable fluorophore/quencher conjugation sites and ratio, desirable chemical stability, and reproducible pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, and is very promising in tumor detection.

      <title>Synthesis of Highly Enantioenriched Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides and Sulfonimidamides by Stereospecific Sulfur&#8211;Fluorine Exchange (SuFEx) Reaction
</title>
      <dc:description>
S&#8211;F exchange: Stereocontrolled synthesis provides highly enantioenriched sulfonimidoyl fluorides for SuFEx chemistry. Enantiospecific S&#8722;N bond formation is achieved with inversion by preventing fluoride promoted racemisation. A diverse array of sulfonimidamides is synthesised by using primary and secondary amines including complex amine&#8208;containing drugs.







Abstract
Sulfonimidamides present exciting opportunities as chiral isosteres of sulfonamides, with potential for additional directional interactions. Here, we present the first modular enantioselective synthesis of sulfonimidamides, including the first stereoselective synthesis of enantioenriched sulfonimidoyl fluorides, and studies on their reactivity. A new route to sulfonimidoyl fluorides is presented from solid bench&#8208;stable, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;sulfinamide (Boc=tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl) salt building blocks. Enantioenriched arylsulfonimidoyl fluorides are shown to be readily racemised by fluoride ions. Conditions are developed, which trap fluoride and enable the stereospecific reaction of sulfonimidoyl fluorides with primary and secondary amines (100&#8201;%&#8197;es, es=enantiospecificity) generating sulfonimidamides with up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. Aryl and alkyl sulfonimidoyl fluoride reagents are suitable for mild late stage functionalisation reactions, exemplified by coupling with a selection of complex amines in marketed drugs.

      <title>A Mechanistic Study on Reactions of Group 13 Diyls LM with Cp*SbX2&#8212;From Stibanyl Radicals to Antimony Hydrides</title>
      <dc:description>
It's radical: Reactions of Cp*SbX2 with LM (M=Ga, In) either selectively yielded Sb&#8208;centered radicals [L(X)Ga]2Sb. or Sb hydrides [L(X)In]2SbH. The unexpected formation of Sb hydrides is the result of different steric congestion from the [L(X)M] ligands as was proven by computational calculations.







Abstract
Oxidative addition of Cp*SbX2 (X=Cl, Br, I; Cp*=C5Me5) to group 13 diyls LM (M=Al, Ga, In; L=HC[C(Me)N (Dip)]2, Dip=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) yields elemental antimony (M=Al) or the corresponding stibanylgallanes [L(X)Ga]Sb(X)Cp* (X=Br 1, I 2) and &#8208;indanes [L(X)In]Sb(X)Cp* (X=Cl 5, Br 6, I 7). 1 and 2 react with a second equivalent of LGa to eliminate decamethyl&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;dihydrofulvalene (Cp*2) and form stibanyl radicals [L(X)Ga]2Sb. (X=Br 3, I 4), whereas analogous reactions of 5 and 6 with LIn selectively yield stibanes [L(X)In]2SbH (X=Cl 8, Br 9) by elimination of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetramethylfulvene. The reactions are proposed to proceed via formation of [L(X)M]2SbCp* as reaction intermediate, which is supported by the isolation of [L(Cl)Ga]2SbCp (11, Cp=C5H5). The reaction mechanism was further studied by computational calculations using two different models. The energy values for the Ga&#8208; and the In&#8208;substituted model systems showing methyl groups instead of the very bulky Dip units are very similar, and in both cases the same products are expected. Homolytic Sb&#8722;C bond cleavage yields van der Waals complexes from the as&#8208;formed radicals ([L(Cl)M]2Sb. and Cp*.), which can be stabilized by hydrogen atom abstraction to give the corresponding hydrides, whereas the direct formation of Sb hydrides starting from [L(Cl)M]2SbCp* via concerted &#946;&#8208;H elimination is unlikely. The consideration of the bulky Dip units reveals that the amount of the steric overload in the intermediate I determines the product formation (radical vs. hydride).

Two ultrafast supramolecular rotors with activation barriers to rotation below 1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, have been obtained by cocrystallization. The dynamic characterization was carried out by using variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray studies, 1H spin&#8211;lattice experiments, and DFT computations by using periodic boundaries.

      <title>Synchronous electrocatalytic design of architectural and electronic structure based on bifunctional LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF towards water splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Rational design of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting is extremely urgent for sustainable energy conversion process to alleviate energy crisis and environment pollution. In this work, by simply depositing layered double hydroxides (LDH) on Co  3  O  4  /NF (NF = Nickel foam) nanosheets arrays, the hierarchical Co  3+  &#8208;riched materials based on LDH&#8208;Co  3  O  4  /NF were designed as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Such performance was due to the optimized electronic states with high concentration of Co  3+  which improved the intrinsic activity and the sheet&#8208;on&#8208;sheet hierarchical structure which increased the number of active sites. The unique synchronous design of both architectural and electronic structure of nanomaterials could accelerate the reaction kinetics and provide a more convenient charge transfer path simultaneously.

      <title>Cucurbit[n]urils for supramolecular catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The control over chemical reactivity and selectivity are always pursued. Using non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve efficient and selective catalysis is an essential goal of supramolecular catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis based on cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) possesses distinct characteristics for the unique structure of CB[n]s. CB[n]s are a family of pumpkin&#8208;shaped host molecules with various molecular sizes, rigid structures, electronegative portals and wealthy host&#8208;guest chemistry. Herein, we summarize the three major mechanisms of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis. Owing to the structural properties of CB[n]s, CB[n]s can serve as nanoreactors and steric hindrance to modulate the reactivity of substrates. They can also catalyze the reactions by modulating the reactivity of ionized intermediates. Recent progresses on the CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis are introduced in this mini&#8208;review and the future development in this field is discussed. It is anticipated that this review provides insights into the mechanism of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis and may help scientists find new opportunities in this field.</dc:description>

Here, toluene soluble component of pitch is used to prepare a kind of laminated carbon. It was realized by a template&#8208;free synthesis in the low temperature with the addition of pressure.

The prepared anode exhibits a splendid electrochemical performance compared to the traditional graphite anode. A high stable capacity of ca. 550 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  which is higher much than graphite (372 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) is obtained. And when the current density is up to 2 A g  &#8208;1  , the capacity is about 150 mAh g  &#8208;1  . Surprisingly, it also delivers a superior cycling performance. And when used as anode/cathode electrode for lithium ion capacitor, a high energy density can be obtained.

      <title>Unusual Nitrene Oxidation Product Formation by Metathesis Involving the Dioxygen O&#8722;O and Borylnitrene B&#8722;N Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Overcoming barriers: The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers. The reaction mechanism of borylnitrene 1 is investigated through matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry. Borylnitrene 1 reacts with dioxygen to form nitritoborane 3&#8201;a via nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomer 2&#8201;c. Nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomer 2&#8201;a is stable towards thermal reaction to 3&#8201;a, but dyotropic rearrangement can be achieved photochemically.







Abstract
The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers, although both reactants are triplet diradicals and the formation of nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxides is spin&#8208;allowed. By means of matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy in solid argon, nitrogen, and neon, and through high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry, it is shown herein that a 3&#8208;nitreno&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;benzodioxaborole CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with dioxygen under cryogenic conditions thermally at temperatures as low as 7&#8197;K to produce two distinct products, an anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide and a nitritoborane CatBONO. The computed barriers for the formation of nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomers are very low. Whereas anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide is kinetically trapped, its bisected isomer has a very low barrier for metathesis, yielding the CatBO+NO radicals in a strongly exothermic reaction; these radicals can combine under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions to give nitritoborane CatBONO. The trapped isomer, anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide, can form the nitritoborane CatBONO only after photoexcitation, possibly involving isomerization to the bisected isomer of anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide.

In contrast to other metal&#8208;based anticancer agents, this organogold compound is less prone to form coordinative bonds with biological nucleophiles, and is expected to exert its drug effects mainly by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Global protein expression changes of treated cancer cells revealed a multi&#8208;modal mode of action of AuTMX2 by alterations in the nucleolus, telomeres, actin stress&#8208;fibers and stress&#8208;responses, which were further supported by pharmacological assays, fluorescence microscopy and cellular accumulation experiments.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled C&#8208;H Functionalization by a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Uranyl Photocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Uranyl cation, as a powerful photocatalyst, at present, is seriously delayed compared to the development of its fundamental and structural chemistry. However, the characteristic of highly oxidative capability in the excited state {[UO  2  ]  2+*  (+ 2.6 V vs. SHE) combined with blue light (hv 380&#8208;500 nm) absorption and a long&#8208;lived fluorescence lifetime up to microseconds have revealed that uranyl cation approaches an ideal photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;drvien organic transformations. Described herein is a successful utilization of uranyl nitrate photocatalyst which enables C(sp  3  )&#8208;H activation and C&#8208;C bond formation through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) under blue light irradiation. In particular, this operationally simple scenario provides an appropriate approach to synthesize diverse and valuable diarylmethane motifs. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations provide insights into detailed mechanism of the photoinduced HAT pathway. The current research is suggestive of a general platform that could popularize promising uranyl photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Resolution Electronic Excitation and Emission Spectra of Pentacene and 6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene Monomers and Weakly Bound Dimers by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;Heteropolycycles are among the most promising candidates for applications in organic devices. For this purpose, a profound understanding of the low&#8208;energy electronic absorbance and emission characteristics is of crucial importance. Herein, we report high&#8208;resolution absorbance and fluorescence spectra of pentacene (  PEN  ) and 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene (  DAP  ) in solid neon obtained using the matrix&#8208;isolation technique. Accompanying DFT calculations allow the assignment of specific vibrationally&#8208;resolved signals to corresponding modes. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence for the formation of van der Waals dimers of both substances. These dimers exhibit significantly different optical characteristics resulting from the change of electronic properties evoked by the incorporation of sp  2  nitrogen into the molecular backbone.</dc:description>

      <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Alcohol Oxidation Coupled to Hydrogen Gas Formation in a Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photosynthesis Cell</title>
      <dc:description>We report a dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) that couples redox&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven oxidative organic transformations to reductive hydrogen (H2) formation. The DSPEC photoanode consists of a mesoporous anatase TiO2 film on FTO (fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide), sensitized with the thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, while H2 was formed at a FTO&#8211;Pt cathode. Irradiation of the dye&#8208;sensitized photoanode transforms 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) to the oxidized TEMPO (TEMPO+), which acts as a chemical oxidant for the conversion of benzyl alcohol. The TEMPO0/+ couple, previously used as redox mediator in DSSC, mediates efficient electron transfer from the organic substrate to the photo&#8208;oxidized dye. A DSPEC photoreactor was designed that allows in situ monitoring the reaction progress by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Sustained light&#8208;driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde within the DSPEC photoreactor, using of TEMPO as mediator, demonstrated the efficiency of the device, with a photocurrent of 0.4 mA cm&#8208;2, approaching quantitative Faradaic efficiency and exhibiting excellent device stability.</dc:description>

      <title>High Efficiency FRET Processes in BODIPY Functionalized Quantum Dot Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient FRET systems are developed combining colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) donors and BODIPY acceptors. To promote effective energy transfer in FRET architectures, the distance between the organic fluorophore and the QDs needs to be optimized by a careful system engineering. In this context, BODIPY dyes bearing amino&#8208;terminated functionalities are used in virtue of the high affinity of amine groups in coordinating the QD surface. A preliminary QD surface treatment with a short amine ligand is performed to favour the interaction with the organic fluorophores in solution. The successful coordination of the dye to the QD surface, accomplishing a short donor&#8208;acceptor distance, provides effective energy transfer already in solution, with efficiency of 76%. The efficiency further increases in solid state where the QDs and the dye are deposited as single coordinated units from solution, with a distance between the fluorophores down to 2.2 nm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the coupling strategy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In order to overcome bacterial resistances, the need for novel antimicrobial agents is urgent. The class of so&#8208;called nucleoside antibiotics furnishes promising candidates for the development of new antibiotics, as these compounds block a clinically unexploited bacterial target: the integral membrane protein MraY, a key enzyme in cell wall (peptidoglycan) biosynthesis.

      <title>Cyanine&#8208;Flavonol Hybrids for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Delivery of Carbon Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with a remarkable therapeutic potential hindered by its inherent toxicity. The cross&#8208;breeding of a CO&#8208;releasing flavonol moiety with a cyanine dye enabled access to the family of CO&#8208;releasing molecules activatable upon irradiation with near&#8208;infrared light up to 820&#8197;nm. These hybrids liberate two molecules of CO with efficiencies surpassing those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems by two orders of magnitude. The biocompatibility and applicability of this system were showcased both in vitro and in vivo. The cover image was created by Lenka &#352;tackov&#225;, Peter &#352;tacko, and Orazio Angelo Arcidiacono. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. &#352;tacko, P.

      <title>A Phosphine Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Diketimine Ligand for the Synthesis of Manifold Metal Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
A bis(diphenyl)&#8208;phosphine functionalized &#946;&#8208;diketimine ligand is depicted in the cover image. This ligand coordinates in a very flexible manner to a number of transition metal ions. The newly designed ligand features a symmetrically placed PNNP&#8208;type pocket. Due to the hard and soft donor atoms (N vs. P) the ligand can stabilize various coordination polyhedra. A complete series ranging from coordination numbers 2 to 6 was realized, resulting in linear, trigonal planar, square planar, tetrahedral, square pyramidal, and octahedral coordination polyhedral. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;W. Roesky et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001357).

      <title>Second Comes First: Switching Elementary Steps in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;poor palladium(0) complex L3Pd (L=tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine) first undergoes transmetalation with RMgCl or RLi before it reacts with alkyl halides in an oxidative addition. Thus, the order of these elementary steps is reversed in comparison to conventional palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
The electron&#8208;poor palladium(0) complex L3Pd (L=tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phosphine) reacts with Grignard reagents RMgX and organolithium compounds RLi via transmetalation to furnish the anionic organopalladates [L2PdR]&#8722;, as shown by negative&#8208;ion mode electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. These palladates undergo oxidative additions of organyl halides R&#8242;X (or related SN2&#8208;type reactions) followed by further transmetalation. Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation of the resulting heteroleptic palladate(II) complexes results in the reductive elimination of the cross&#8208;coupling products RR&#8242;. This reaction sequence corresponds to a catalytic cycle, in which the order of the elementary steps of transmetalation and oxidative addition is switched relative to that of palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceeding via neutral intermediates. An attractive feature of the palladate&#8208;based catalytic system is its ability to mediate challenging alkyl&#8211;alkyl coupling reactions. However, the poor stability of the phosphine ligand L against decomposition reactions has so far prevented its successful use in practical applications.

      <title>Cycling between Molybdenum&#8208;Dinitrogen and &#8208;Nitride Complexes to Support the Reaction Pathway for Catalytic Formation of Ammonia from Dinitrogen</title>

&#8220;Three years ago, we reported the catalytic formation of ammonia from dinitrogen via direct cleavage of the nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen triple bond of molecular dinitrogen as a key step.

      <title>Selective Phase Transfer Reagents (OxP&#8208;crowns) for Chromogenic Detection of Nitrates Especially Ammonium Nitrate</title>
      <dc:description>
A color&#8208;based detector for ammonium nitrate consists of crown ether&#8208;appended oxoporphyrinogens, the OxP&#8208;Crowns, which extract ion pairs into an organic phase based on cation binding at crown ether and anion complexation. Selective mauve chromogenic response is observed when ammonium nitrate, commonly used in improvised explosive devices, is extracted from water to chloroform providing a simple test. As illustrated, a network of responses is found when considering other anions and aqueous phase pH. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;P. Hill et&#8197;al.

      <title>Structure Directing Roles of Organic Molecules in the Formation of Aluminosilicate and Aluminophosphate Molecular Sieves Revealed by 2D 1H DQ&#8208;SQ NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding of crystallization mechanisms of molecular sieves is driven by the broad range of usefulness and unique properties they possess. It is still difficult to obtain information related to their crystallization mechanism of molecular sieves, partly because the materials are generally prepared under hydrothermal conditions and the whole reactions have happened in the &#8220;black box&#8221; autoclave.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In the present study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interactions with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which featured the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformational mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically via side chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <title>New promises and opportunities in 3D printable inks based on coordination compounds for the creation of objects with multiple applications</title>
      <dc:description>This review focuses on the usefulness of coordination bonds to create 3D printable inks and shows how the union of chemistry and 3D technology contributes to new scientific advances, by allowing amorphous or polycrystalline solids to be transformed into objects with the desired shape for successful applications. The review clearly shows how there has been a considerable increase in the manufacture of objects based on the combination of organic matrices and coordination compounds. These coordination compounds are usually homogeneously dispersed within the matrix, anchored onto proper support, or coating the printed object, without destroying their unique properties. Advances are so fast that today it has already been possible to 3D print objects made exclusively from coordination compounds without additives. The new printable inks are made mainly with nano&#8208; non&#8208;porous coordination polymers, metal&#8208;organic gels, or metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The highly dynamic coordination bond allows the creation of objects with responses to stimuli that can act as sensors and drug delivery. In addition, the join of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with 3D print allows increasing the adsorption or selective capacity of the object concerning the original compound, being useful in energy storage, in gas separation, or water pollutant elimination. Furthermore, the metal ion's presence can give them new properties such as luminescence finding usefulness in sensors, or anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Technological advances, the combination of various printing techniques, the properties of the coordination bonds, anything goes to create surprising new printable inks and objects with highly complex shapes, that will shorten the gap between the academy and the industry of the coordination compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Clar Goblet and Aromaticity Driven Multiradical Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>The Clar Goblet, the first radical bowtie nanographene proposed by Erich Clar nearly 50 years ago, was recently synthesized. Bowtie nanographenes present quasi&#8208;degenerate magnetic ground states which make them so elusive as unique.

      <title>Stepwise physisorption of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene derivatives onto a lamellar, non&#8208;porous naphthalenediimide&#8208;template on HOPG</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new strategies for the preparation of multicomponent supramolecular assemblies is a major challenge on the road to complex functional molecular systems. Here we present the use of a non&#8208;porous self&#8208;assembled monolayer from uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33, a naphthalenediimide symmetrically functionalized with unsaturated 33 carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;chains, to prepare bicomponent supramolecular surface systems with a series of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene (PyrOR) derivatives at the liquid/HOPG interface. While previous attempts at directly depositing many of these PyrOR units at the liquid/HOPG interface failed, the multicomponent approach through the uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 template enabled control over molecular interactions and facilitated physisorption. The PyrOR deposition restructured the initial uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 monolayer, causing an expansion in two dimensions to accommodate the guests. As far as we know, this represent the first example of a non&#8208;porous or non&#8208;metal complex&#8208;bearing monolayer that allows the stepwise formation of multicomponent supramolecular architectures on surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Breslow Intermediates (Aminoenols) and their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Breslow intermediates (BIs) are the crucial nucleophilic amino enol intermediates formed from electrophilic aldehydes in the course of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed Umpolung reactions. Both in organocatalytic and enzymatic Umpolung, the question whether the Breslow intermediate exists as the nucleophilic enol, or in the form of its electrophilic keto&#8208;tautomer, is of utmost importance for its reactivity and function. We herein report the preparation of charge&#8208;tagged Breslow intermediates/keto tautomers derived from three different types of NHCs (imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes, 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes, thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes) and aldehydes. An ammonium charge&#8208;tag is introduced by either the aldehyde unit or the NHC. ESI&#8208;MS IR&#8208;Ion spectroscopy allowed for the unambiguous conclusion that in the gas&#8208;phase, the imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derived BI indeed exists as a diamino enol, while both 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes and thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes give the keto&#8208;tautomer. This result coincides with the tautomeric states observed for the BIs in solution (NMR) and in the crystalline state (XRD), and is in line with our earlier calculations on the energetics of BI keto&#8208;enol equilibria.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Optical Properties by Controlled Aggregation: Electroluminescence Assisted by Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Thin Films of Crystalline Chromophores</title>
      <dc:description>Several photophysical properties of chromophores depend crucially on intermolecular interactions. Thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is often influenced by close packing of the chromophore assembly. In this context, the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) approach has several advantages: it can be used to steer aggregation such that the orientation within aggregated structures can be predicted using rational approaches. We demonstrate this design concept for a DPA&#8208;TPE (diphenylamine&#8208;tetraphenylethylene) chromophore, which is non&#8208;emissive in its solvated state due to vibrational quenching. Turning this DPA&#8208;TPE into a ditopic linker allows to grow oriented MOF thin films exhibiting pronounced green electroluminescence with low onset voltages. Measurements at different temperatures clearly demonstrate the presence of TADF. Finally, we show that the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer process used for MOF thin film deposition allowed to integrate the TADF&#8208;DPA&#8208;TPE in a functioning LED device.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Dihalogenation of Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>The dihalogenation of alkenes is one of the classic reactions in organic chemistry and a prime example for an electrophilic addition reaction. The often observed  anti  &#8208;selectivity in this addition reaction can be explained by the formation of a haliranium ion intermediate. Despite being studied for more than a century, the development of reagent&#8208;controlled, enantioselective dihalogenation has been very difficult. Only recently, significant progress has been achieved. In this review, we provide an overview on current method development in enantioselective dihalogenation and discuss mechanistic aspects, which render this transformation challenging.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dihalogenation of alkenes is one of the classic reactions in organic chemistry and a prime example for an electrophilic addition reaction. The often observed  anti  &#8208;selectivity in this addition reaction can be explained by the formation of a haliranium ion intermediate. Despite being studied for more than a century, the development of reagent&#8208;controlled, enantioselective dihalogenation has been very difficult. Only recently, significant progress has been achieved. In this review, we provide an overview on current method development in enantioselective dihalogenation and discuss mechanistic aspects, which render this transformation challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Dual crosslinking photo&#8208;switches for orthogonal photo&#8208;control of hybridization between serinol nucleic acid and RNA</title>
      <dc:description>Wavelength&#8208;selective photo&#8208;regulation by multiple chromophores responding to different wavelength can expand the variation of photo&#8208;manipulating system. Herein, we report orthogonal photo&#8208;regulation of duplex formation between serinol nucleic acid (SNA) and RNA using light&#8208;induced crosslinking reactions mediated by a new photo&#8208;reactive nucleobase 8&#8208;naphthylvinyladenine (  NV  A) and previously described 8&#8208;pyrenylvinyladenine (  PV  A). An intrastrand crosslink was induced in an SNA strand containing two adjacent&#160;  NV  A residues by irradiation with 340&#8208;405 nm light; the crosslink was reversed by irradiation with &#8804; 300 nm light. In an SNA strand with adjacent&#160;  NV  A and&#160;  PV  A residues, an intrastrand crosslink resulted from irradiation with 405&#8208;465 nm light that was reversed by irradiation with &#8804; 340 nm light. Intrastrand photo&#8208;crosslinking caused severe destabilization of an SNA/RNA duplex, resulting in dissociation to single strands. Cycloreversion resulted in duplex formation. With these&#160;  NV  A/  NV  A and&#160;  NV  A/  PV  A photo&#8208;switches, four hybridization states of two SNA/RNA duplexes could be orthogonally photo&#8208;controlled by irradiation with a suitable wavelength of light.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired guanine microplatelets: morphological and crystallographic control</title>
      <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine (&#946;&#8208;AG) crystals are one of the most widespread organic crystals to construct optical structures in organisms. Currently no synthetic method is available that allows for producing guanine crystals with similar control in size, morphology and crystallography as in biological ones. Here we report a facile one&#8208;step synthesis route to fabricate bio&#8208;inspired guanine microplatelets with (100) exposing planes in almost pure &#946;&#8208;phase.&#160;The synthesis is based on a precipitation process of a guanine&#8208;sodium hydroxide solution in formamide with poly(1&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone&#8208;co&#8208;vinyl acetate) as a morphological additive. Due to their uniform size (ca. 20 &#181;m) and thickness (ca. 110 nm), the crystals represent the first synthetic guanine microplatelets that exhibit strong structural coloration and pearlescent lusters.&#160;Moreover, we utilize this synthesis route as a model system to investigate the effects of guanine analogues, including uric acid, hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine, and guanosine, during the crystallization process.&#160;Our results indicate that the introduction of guanine analogues not only can reduce the required synthesis temperature but also provide a versatile control in crystal morphology and polymorph selection between the &#945;&#8208;phase AG (&#945;&#8208;AG) and &#946;&#8208;AG. Turbidity experiments show that the &#946;&#8208;AG microplatelets are formed with a fast precipitation rate in comparison to &#945;&#8208;AG, suggesting that the formation of &#946;&#8208;AG crystals follows a kinetically driven process.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Diversification of Macrocyclic Alkynediyl Sulfide Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of rare macrocyclic alkynediyl sulfides via a new Cu&#8208;catalyzed Csp&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling is presented. The catalytic protocol (Cu(MeCN)4PF6/dtbbpy) promotes macrocyclization of peptides, dipeptides and tripeptides at ambient temperature (14 examples, 23&#8594;73% yields) via thiols and bromoalkynes, and is chemoselective with regards to terminal alkynes.

      <title>Predicting Properties of Iron(III) TAML Activators of Peroxides from Their III/IV and IV/V Reduction Potentials or a Lost Battle to Peroxidase</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclic voltammetry study of a series of iron(III) TAML activators of peroxides of several generations in acetonitrile as solvent revealed reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible Fe  III/IV  and Fe  IV/V  anodic transitions, the formal reduction potentials  E  &#176;' for which are observed in the ranges of 0.4&#8211;1.2 and 1.4&#8211;1.6 V, respectively, versus Ag/AgCl. The slope of 0.33 for a linear  E  &#176;'(IV/V) against  E  &#176;'(III/IV) plot suggests that the TAML ligand system plays a bigger role in the Fe  III/IV  transition whereas the second electron transfer is to a larger extent an iron&#8208;centered phenomenon. The reduction potentials appeared to be a convenient tool for analysis of various properties of iron TAML activators in terms of LFERs. The values of  E  &#176;'(III/IV) and  E  &#176;'(IV/V) correlate (i) with p  K  a  's of the axial aqua ligand of iron(III) TAMLs with the slopes of 0.28 and 0.06 V, respectively; (ii) with the Stern&#8208;Volmer constants  K  SV  for the quenching of fluorescence of propranolol, a micropollutant of broad concern; (iii) with the calculated ionization potentials of Fe  III  and Fe  IV  TAMLs; (iv) with rate constants  k  I  and  k  II  for the oxidation of the resting iron(III) TAML state by H  2  O  2  and reactions of the active forms of TAMLs formed with donors of electrons S, respectively. Interestingly, slopes of log  k  II  vs  E  &#176;'(III/IV) plots are lower for easy&#8208;to&#8208;oxidize S than for harder&#8208;to&#8208;oxidize S.

      <title>The Cascade Reactions of Indigo with Propargyl Substrates for Heterocyclic and Photophysical Diversity</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of structurally diverse heterocycles for chemical space exploration was achieved  via  the cascade reactions of indigo with propargylic electrophiles. New pyrazinodiindolodione, naphthyridinedione, azepinodiindolone, oxazinoindolone and pyrrolodione products were prepared in one pot reactions by varying the leaving group (&#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, &#8208;OMs, &#8208;OTs) or propargyl terminal functionality (&#8208;H, &#8208;Me, &#8208;Ph, &#8208;Ar). Mechanistic and density functional theory studies revealed that the unsaturated propargyl moiety can behave as an electrophile when aromatic terminal substitutions are made, and therefore competes with leaving group substitution for new outcomes. Selected products from the cascade reactions were investigated for their absorption and fluorescence properties, including transient absorption spectroscopy. This revealed polarity dependent excited state relaxation pathways, fluorescence, and triplet formation, thus highlighting these reactions as a means to access diverse functional materials rapidly.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of Diethyl Ether for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of hyperpolarized gases as contrast agents provides valuable information on lungs structure and function. While the technology of  129  Xe hyperpolarization for clinical MRI research is well developed, it requires the expensive equipment for production and detection of hyperpolarized  129  Xe. Herein we present the  1  H hyperpolarization of diethyl ether vapor that can be imaged on any clinical MRI scanner.  1  H nuclear spin polarization of up to 1.3% was achieved using heterogeneous hydrogenation of ethyl vinyl ether with parahydrogen over Rh/TiO  2  catalyst. Liquefaction of diethyl ether vapor proceeds with partial preservation of hyperpolarization and prolongs its lifetime by ~10 times. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle 2D  1  H MRI of hyperpolarized diethyl ether was demonstrated with 0.1&#215;1.1 mm  2  spatial and 120 ms temporal resolution. The long history of use of diethyl ether for anesthesia is expected to facilitate the clinical translation of the presented approach.</dc:description>

      <title>The deposition of the spin crossover Fe(II)&#8208;pyrazolylborate complex on Au(111) surface at molecular level</title>

Our results show that the adsorption on the metallic surface enhances the transition energy, increasing the relative stability of the low spin (LS) state. The interaction indeed is spin&#8208;dependent, stronger for the low spin than the high spin (HS) state. The different strength of the Fe ligand field at low and high temperature manifests on the nature, spatial extension and relative energy of the states close to the Fermi level, with a larger metal&#8208;ligand hybridization in the LS state. This feature is of relevance for the differential adsorption of the LS and HS molecules, the spin&#8208;dependent conductance, and for the differences found in the corresponding STM images, correctly reproduced from the density of states provided by the rPBE calculations. It is expected that this spin dependence will be a general feature of the SCO molecule&#8208;substrate interaction, since it is rooted in the different ligand field of Fe site at low and high temperatures, a common hallmark of the Fe(II) SCO complexes. Finally, the states involved in the LIESST phenomenon has been identify through NEVPT2 calculations on a model reaction path. A tentative pathway for the photoinduced LS [[EQUATION]] HS transition is proposed, that does not involve the intermediate triplet states, and nicely reproduces both the blue laser wavelength required for the activation, and the wavelength of the reverse HS [[EQUATION]] LS transition.</dc:description>

      <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid that Can Extract Cu2+ from Metallothionein via Selective Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>Selective binding of Cu  2+  in water medium by a synthetic chelator is a promising therapeutic approach towards the treatment of various diseases including cancer. Chelation of Cu  2+  is well exercised, however water&#8208;soluble synthetic chelators that can selectively bind Cu  2+  from a pool of competing metal ions at very high excess and/or can extract Cu  2+  from a protein are hardly reported. Herein we describe the design and synthesis of an acetylated peptoid &#8211; N&#8208;substituted glycine trimer &#8211; that incorporates a picolyl group at the N&#8208;terminal, a non&#8208;coordinating but structurally directing bulky chiral phenylethyl group at the  C  &#8208;terminus and a modified 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine group (  PCA&#8208;Nspe  ), which selectively binds Cu  2+  to form a water&#8208;soluble complex. We further demonstrate that the selectivity of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  to Cu  2+  is thermodynamically driven, leading to specific binding of Cu  2+  in an aqueous solution containing up to 60 folds excess of other biologically relevant metal ions such as Zn  2+  , Co  2+  , Mn  2+  , Ca  2+  , Mg  2+  , K  +  and Na  +  . Based on spectroscopic data and DFT calculations of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  as well as of a control peptoid having an achiral benzyl group instead of the phenylethyl side chain, we could suggest that the chiral and bulkier phenylethyl group at the  C  &#8208;terminus controls the preorganization of the two ligands and this might play a role in the selectivity of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  . Significantly, we show that  PCA&#8208;Nspe  can extract Cu  2+  from the natural copper binding protein metallothionein.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Expansion of Chalcogenido Tetrelates in Ionic Liquids by Incorporation of Sulfido Antimonate Units</title>
      <dc:description>Multinary chalcogenido metalate salts exhibit finely tunable optical properties based on the combination of metal and chalcogenide ions in their polyanionic substructure. Here, we present the structural expansion of chalcogenido germanate(IV) or stannate(IV) architectures with Sb(III), which clearly affects the vibrational and optical absorption properties of the solid compounds. For the synthesis of the title compounds, [K4(H2O)4][Ge4S10] or [K4(H2O)4][SnS4] were reacted with SbCl3 under ionothermal conditions in imidazolium based ionic liquids. Salt metathesis at relatively low temperatures (120&#176;C) enabled the incorporation of (formally) Sb3+ ions into the anionic substructure of the precursors, and their modification to form (Cat)16[Ge2Sb2S7]6[GeS4] (1) and (Cat)6[Sn10O4S20][Sb3S4]2 (2a and 2b), wherein Cat = (C4C1C1Im)+ (1 and 2a) or (C4C1C2Im)+ (2b). In 1, germanium and antimony atoms are combined to form a rare noradamantane&#8208;type ternary molecular anion, six of which surround a [GeS4] unit in a highly symmetric secondary structure, and finally crystallize in a diamond&#8208;like superstructure. In 2, supertetrahedral oxo&#8208;sulfido stannate clusters are generated, as known from the ionothermal treatment of the stannate precursor alone, yet, linked here into unprecedented one&#8208;dimensional strands with {Sb3S4} units as linkers. We discuss the single&#8208;crystal structures of these uncommon salts of ternary and quaternary chalcogenido metalate anions, as well as their Raman and UV&#8208;visible spectra.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Attacks using chemical warfare agents (CWAs,) including organophosphate soman (GD) and thioether mustard gas (HD) threaten both innocent civilians and military personnel, spawning significant research into catalytically&#8208;active composite textiles and new wearable protective gear.

A simple template&#8208;free low&#8208;temperature synthesis yields new zirconium&#8208;porphyrin based nano&#8208;crystalline PCN&#8208;222 MOF&#8208;fabrics with adjustable MOF loading and robust mechanical adhesion on low&#8208;cost nonwoven polypropylene fibers. Importantly, we report the discovery of visible photo&#8208;activation of GD hydrolysis by a MOF&#8208;fabric, which is ascribed to oxidation at the active metal node site, significantly increasing the rate over that observed without illumination. Moreover, because the active MOF catalysts are uniformly displayed on the MOF&#8208;textile, the composite geometry enhances the kinetics of active agent photo&#8208;degradation relative to the same mass of MOF in common powder form. These results provide important new insights into the design of future materials and chemical systems to protect military, first&#8208;responders, and civilians upon exposure to complex chemical toxins.</dc:description>
