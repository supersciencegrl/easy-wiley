         <title>Revisiting Peri&#8208;Aryloxyquinones: From a Forgotten Photochromic System to a Promising Tool for Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging applications of photochromic compounds demand new molecular designs that can be inspired by some longknown yet currently forgotten classes of photoswitches. In the present review, we remind the community about PeriAryloxyQuinones (PAQs) and their unique photoswitching behavior originally discovered more than 50 years ago. At the heart of this phenomenon is the light&#8208;induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted quinones resulting in ana&#8208;quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana&#8208;isomer. Particularly noticeable is the high sensitivity of the ana&#8208;isomer towards nucleophiles in solution. In addition to the mechanism of molecular photochromism and the underlaying structure&#8208;switch relationships, we analyze potential applications and prospects of aryloxyquinones in optically switchable materials and devices. Due to their ability to efficiently photoswitch in the solid state, PAQs are indeed attractive candidates for such materials and devices, including electronics (optically controllable circuits, switches, transistors, memories, and displays), porous crystalline materials, crystalline actuators, photoactivated sensors, and many more. This review is intended to serve as a guide for researchers who wish to use photoswitchable PAQs in the development of new photocontrollable materials, devices, and processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a rapid, efficient, and scope&#8208;extensive approach for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs. Photophysical analyses reveal red&#8208;shifted absorption &#8208; corroborated by TD&#8208;DFT and DLPNO&#8208;STEOM&#8208;CCSD computations &#8208; and color&#8208;tunable emission with large Stokes shifts in the selenium&#8208;containing derivatives compared to their precursors. In addition, due to the presence of the heavy Se atoms, competitive ISC generates triplet states which sensitize 1O2 and display phosphorescence in PMMA films at RT and in a frozen glass matrix at 77 K. Importantly, the selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs demonstrate the ability to selectively stain lipid droplets, exhibiting distinct fluorescence in both green and red channels. This work highlights the potential of electrochemistry as an efficient method for synthesizing unique emission&#8208;tunable fluorophores with broad&#8208;ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields</dc:description>

         <title>General Construction of Asymmetric Amine Ethers via Efficient Transesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel method to prepare asymmetric amine ether is reported. Tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfate intermediates are prepared through a reactive distillation process, followed by the transesterification process to afford eventually asymmetric amine ethers. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed the essential roles the moderately acidic sulfate group plays in the highly selective monoesterification process. This clean method is tolerant towards various functional groups with good yields under relatively rather short reaction time mild condition, which is obviously superior compared to the conventional processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first C70&#8208;based &#8220;ionic&#8221; endohedral fullerene, Li+@C70, was synthesized and isolated as PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; salts. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ion pair structures were fully confirmed by spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Optical spectroscopy as well as electrochemical measurements revealed that the encapsulated Li+ strongly stabilized the orbital energy of C70 through Coulomb interaction without changing the original energy gap and orbital degeneracy of the cage.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.

         <title>A Strategy Based on &#8220;Ambident Anthracene&#8221; for the Synthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Iptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes using an &#8220;ambident anthracene&#8221; building block is presented. For that purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is the longest&#8208;chain iptycene synthesized so far.

Synthesis of thioureas using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials: multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant.







Abstract
Thiourea derivatives are in&#8208;demand motifs in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science, yet redox methods for the synthesis that start from safe, simple, inexpensive and readily available feedstocks are scarce. In this article, we disclose the synthesis of these motifs using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials. The method harnesses the multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant. Extension of this reaction to cyclizable amines and/or higher homologues of nitromethane led to a wide range of nitrogen heterocycles and thioamides. Operationally simple, the reactions are scalable, tolerate a wide range of functional groups, and can be employed for the direct functionalization of natural products. Mechanistically, the nitro group was found to act as an oxidant leaving group, being reduced to ammonia whereas sulfur, along with the role of a sulfur building block for the thiocarbonyl group, behaved as a complementary reductant, being oxidized to sulfate.

         <title>B&#8208;P Coupling: Metal Stabilized Phosphinoborate Complexes</title>

Synthesis and characterization of phosphinoborate complex through B&#8208;P coupling reaction involving Ru&#8208;(&#963;&#8208;borate) species and chlorodiphenyl phosphine.







Abstract
In an effort to establish B&#8208;P coupling reactions without the use of phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling agent, we have developed a new synthetic methodology employing group&#8197;8 metal &#963;&#8208;borate complex [{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S&#8242;&#8208;BH2L2}Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH3L}] (L=NC5H4S), 1. Treatment of 1 with chlorodiphenyl phosphine (PPh2Cl) yielded 1,5&#8208;P,S chelated Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate species [PPh2H{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH(OH)L}Ru{&#954;2&#8208;P,S&#8208;(Ph2P)BH2L}], 2. The insertion of phosphine moiety (PPh2) by the cleavage of 3c&#8211;2e &#963;(Ru&#8230;H&#8208;B) bonding interaction led to the formation of B&#8208;P bond. The &#954;2&#8208;P,S chelated six&#8208;membered ring adopted a boat conformation in complex 2. The heterocycle is made of all different atoms, which is one of the rarest examples of heteroatomic ring systems. Theoretical outcomes demonstrated the electronic insight of B&#8208;P coupling and stabilization through transition metal. In order to explore an alternate route of B&#8208;P bond formation, we have further explored the reaction of 1 and Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complex, 5 with secondary phosphine oxide (SPO). Although, thermolysis of 1 with diphenylphosphine oxide yielded analogous &#963;&#8208;borate complex 3, the similar reaction of 5 at room temperature led to the formation of novel phosphinous(III) acid incorporated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 6. In a similar fashion, the reaction of 5 with phosphite ligand generated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 7, which is analogous to 6.

         <title>Simulating non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics of photoexcited phenyl azide: Investigating electronic and structural relaxation en route to the formation of phenyl nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of phenyl azide lead by coupled nuclear motion results in excited singlet photoproduct. Surface hopping simulations based on multi&#8208;reference model reveal that the second electronic excited state steers the N2 elimination, accompanied by synchronous bond elongation and angular rotation.







Abstract
Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multi&#8208;configurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N&#8722;N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N&#8722;N&#8722;N bond angle. The 100&#8197;fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.

         <dc:description>
Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis: The reaction of P4 with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source was developed for the first time to afford a series of phosphoryltriacetates. This approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.







Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it's of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmentally&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.

         <title>Tripodal Triazine and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;based Small Molecules as Efficient Photocatalysts for Visible&#8208;light Oxidative Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripodal molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 exhibited absorption in 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm range in solutions and optical bandgaps (Egopt) of 3.10&#8197;eV and 2.64&#8197;eV, respectively. Electron mobilities of 5.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs and 6.14&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs were obtained for Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 respectively. Excellent photocatalytic abilities of compounds were observed towards highly selective formation of benzimidazoles through the oxidative condensation between o&#8208;phenylenediamines and carboxaldehydes.







Abstract
Tripodal donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) small molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 consisting of triphenyl triazine and 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide, without and with a thiophene spacer have been synthesized. Their optical and redox properties were thoroughly investigated along with their utilization as photocatalysts in organic transformations. Compounds Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 showed broad absorption in the range of 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm in solutions and 300&#8211;510&#8197;nm in thin films.

         <title>Optical Cavity Design and Functionality for Molecular Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavity strong coupling offers prospects for showcasing captivating photochemical or photophysical phenomena. Recently, significant advancements have been made in the fabrication of microcavities specifically designed for strong coupling. The development of microcavities with multiple functions beyond simply optical resonators allows further investigation of strong coupling systems and opens the way for practical applications.







Abstract
Optical cavity/molecule strong coupling offers attractive opportunities to modulate photochemical or photophysical processes. When atoms or molecules are placed in an optical cavity, they can coherently exchange photonic energy with optical cavity vacuum fields, entering the strong coupling interaction regime. Recent work suggests that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecules can be significantly changed by strong coupling, resulting in the emergence of intriguing photochemical and photophysical phenomena. As more and more physico&#8208;chemical systems are studied under strong coupling conditions, optical cavities have also advanced in their sophistication, responsiveness, and (multi)functionality. In this review, we highlight some of these recent developments, particularly focusing on Fabry&#8211;Perot microcavities.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by Integrating Reductive Amination of Ketones and Aldehydes with CO2 Fixation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) was used as catalyst for the one&#8208;pot N&#8208;formylation of both aldehydes and ketones (30 substrates) in high yield. Synchrotron PXRD reveals the activation of carbonyl compounds via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis and control experiments suggest formate species as the intermediate derived from the reduction of CO2 and reveal the possible reaction pathway.







Abstract
Formamides are important feedstocks for the manufacture of many fine chemicals. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis of formamides relies on the use of an excess amount of reagents, giving copious waste and thus poor atom&#8208;economy. Here, we report the first example of direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by coupling two challenging reactions, namely reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, particularly biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes and ketones, and fixation of CO2 in the presence of H2 over a metal&#8208;organic framework supported ruthenium catalyst, Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Highly selective production of N&#8208;formamides has been observed for a wide range of carbonyl compounds. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the presence of strong host&#8208;guest binding interactions via hydrogen bonding and parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the catalyst and adsorbed substrates facilitating the activation of substrates and promoting selectivity to formamides. The use of multifunctional porous catalysts to integrate CO2 utilisation in the synthesis of formamide products will have a significant impact in the sustainable synthesis of feedstock chemicals.

         <dc:description>A convenient and versatile approach to important 1&#8208;azaspirocyclic systems relevant to medicinal chemistry and natural products is reported herein. The main strategy relies on a reductive decarboxylative cyclization of redox&#8208;active esters which can be rapidly assembled from abundant cyclic azaacids and tailored acceptor sidechains, with a focus on alkyne acceptors enabling the generation of useful exo&#8208;alkene moieties. Diastereoconvergent variants were studied and could be achieved either through remote stereocontrol or conformational restriction in bicyclic carbamate substrates. Two sets of metal&#8208;free photocatalytic conditions employing inexpensive eosin Y were disclosed and studied experimentally to highlight key mechanistic divergences.</dc:description>

         <title>Borirenes and Boriranes: Development and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strained compounds constitute a highly topical area of research in chemistry. Borirene and borirane both feature a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring. They can be viewed as the analogous compounds derived from cyclopropane and cyclopropene, where a CH2 unit of the carbonaceous counterparts is replaced with BH, respectively. Indeed, this structural variation introduces numerous intriguing aspects. For instance, borirane and borirene are both Lewis acidic due to the presence of a tricoordinate borane center. In addition, borirene is 2&#960; aromatic according to H&#252;ckel's rule. On the other hand, recent successful syntheses of benzoborienes and their carborane&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional analogues have introduced novel perspectives to this field. Their applications as valuable "BC2" synthons have become increasingly evident along with the newly disclosed reactivity. Additionally, the boosted Lewis acidity of carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, thanks to the potent electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of o&#8208;carborane, combined with their readiness for ring enlargement, makes them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks in the construction of chemically responsive luminescent materials. This review provides a summary of the synthesis and reactivity of borirene and borirane derivatives, with the aim of encouraging the design of new borierene&#8208; and borirane&#8208;based molecules and inspiring further exploration of their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Hydrogen Storage Capacity in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we show how Bayesian Optimisation (BO) may be used to find the MOF with the highest simulated hydrogen storage capacity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BO searches more effectively than evolutionary and one&#8208;shot supervised machine learning approaches.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) can be employed for gas storage, capture, and sensing. Finding the MOF with the best adsorption property from a large database is usual for adsorption calculations. In high&#8208;throughput computational research, the expense of computing thermodynamic quantities limits the finding of MOFs for separations and storage. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of Bayesian optimization (BO) for estimating the H2 uptake capability of MOFs by using an existing dataset containing 98000 real and hypothetical MOFs. We demonstrate that in order to recover the best candidate MOFs, less than 0.027&#8201;% of the database needs to be screened using the BO method. This allows future adsorption experiments on a small sample of MOFs to be undertaken with minimal experimental effort by effectively screening MOF databases.

     alt="Exploring Hydrogen Storage Capacity in Metal-Organic Frameworks: A Bayesian Optimization Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we show how Bayesian Optimisation (BO) may be used to find the MOF with the highest simulated hydrogen storage capacity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BO searches more effectively than evolutionary and one-shot supervised machine learning approaches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) can be employed for gas storage, capture, and sensing. Finding the MOF with the best adsorption property from a large database is usual for adsorption calculations. In high-throughput computational research, the expense of computing thermodynamic quantities limits the finding of MOFs for separations and storage. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of Bayesian optimization (BO) for estimating the &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capability of MOFs by using an existing dataset containing 98000 real and hypothetical MOFs. We demonstrate that in order to recover the best candidate MOFs, less than 0.027&#8201;% of the database needs to be screened using the BO method. This allows future adsorption experiments on a small sample of MOFs to be undertaken with minimal experimental effort by effectively screening MOF databases. In addition, the presented BO can provide comprehensible material design insights, and the framework will be transferable to optimizing other target properties. We also suggest using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a swarm intelligence technique in artificial intelligence, to estimate MOFs&#8217; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake potential to achieve results comparable to BO. In addition, we implement a novel modification of PSO called Evolutionary-PSO (EPSO) to compare and find interesting outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges in the Direct Detection of Chirality&#8208;induced Spin Selectivity: Investigation of Foldamer&#8208;based Donor&#8208;acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct spectroscopic detection of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect can shed light on the complex relationship between chirality and electron spin. This work deals with the photophysical investigation of novel D&#8208;&#967;&#8208;A dyads, comprising pyrene (D) and fullerene (A) connected by chiral saturated peptide bridges (&#967;) of different length and electric dipole moment.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect was reported in several experiments disclosing a unique connection between chirality and electron spin. Recent theoretical works highlighted time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (trEPR) as a powerful tool to directly detect the spin polarization resulting from CISS. Here, we report a first attempt to detect CISS at the molecular level by linking the pyrene electron donor to the fullerene acceptor with chiral peptide bridges of different length and electric dipole moment. The dyads are investigated by an array of techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, steady&#8208;state and transient optical spectroscopies, and trEPR. Despite the promising energy alignment of the electronic levels, our multi&#8208;technique analysis reveals no evidence of electron transfer (ET), highlighting the challenges of spectroscopic detection of CISS. However, the analysis allows the formulation of guidelines for the design of chiral organic model systems suitable to directly probe CISS&#8208;polarized ET.

         <title>An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations with Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of four mixed or &#8220;hybrid&#8221; pyridinium amidate/amidate donors into a macrocyclic ligand leads to a superior iron catalyst that resists acid&#8208;induced demetallation and rapidly catalyses hydrogen peroxide oxidation of the surrogate organic pollutant orange II in water at pH&#8197;7 and at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The macrocyclic proligand [H4L][OTf]2, which contains four carboxamide functions and two conjugated pyridinium groups, is easily deprotonated by the weak base sodium acetate to give the corresponding neutral proligand [H2L]. Metallation of [H2L] with iron(II) chloride proceeds rapidly to form the macrocyclic complex, [FeIIICl(L)]. This is an effective catalyst for the oxidation of the organic dye orange II by hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution, and the kinetic parameters for this reaction have been determined. In striking contrast to an analogous iron&#8208;TAML complex that contains two phenyl groups in place of the two pyridinium groups, [FeIIICl(L)] is a very active oxidation catalyst at pH&#8197;7 and is also highly stable towards acid&#8208;promoted demetallation at pH&#8197;5 or above. The results show that the two pyridinium groups bring greatly enhanced catalytic properties to [FeIIICl(L)].

         <title>Bismuth Infrared Star: Being at a Glance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bonding patterns of bismuth homoatomic polycations and their heteroatomic derivatives were analyzed using the AdNDP approach. Multiple delocalized bonds were observed in the clusters, influencing their absorption properties. The emission spectrum of Bi53+ was accurately predicted, demonstrating near&#8208;infrared luminescence. These findings provide insights into the photophysical properties and bonding nature of bismuth clusters for material design.







Abstract
Bismuth polycations have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their extraordinary and counter&#8208;intuitive structures and stoichiometries. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, understanding of the bonding in such clusters remains insufficient. An AdNDP bonding analysis was conducted to elucidate the bonding characteristics using both homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters with various stoichiometries. Analysis of the calculated nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift data confirmed the aromatic nature of these species. Universal bonding patterns were identified that can be applied to a range of homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters. Additionally, calculations of absorbance and fluorescence spectra were performed to gain insights into the near&#8208;infrared emission and establish a potential correlation between absorbance and the identified bonding patterns.

         <title>Modulating Strain in Twisted Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of twisted pyrene&#8208;fused twistacenes has been synthesized that allowed the investigation of the effects of different sterically&#8208;demanding groups on their structure and properties.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of strained aromatics provide an additional insight into the relationship between structure and properties. In the last years, several approaches to twist pyrene&#8208;fused azaacenes have been developed that allow to introduce twists of different sizes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a new set of twisted dibenzotetraazahexacenes constituted by fused pyrene and quinoxaline residues that have been distorted by introducing increasingly larger substituents on the quinoxaline residues. Their twisted structure has been demonstrated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, absorption, fluorescence, electrochemical and theoretical studies shine light on the effects of the substituents and twists on the optoelectronic and redox properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design and synthesis of strained aromatics provide an additional insight into the relationship between structure and properties. In the last years, several approaches to twist pyrene-fused azaacenes have been developed that allow to introduce twists of different sizes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a new set of twisted dibenzotetraazahexacenes constituted by fused pyrene and quinoxaline residues that have been distorted by introducing increasingly larger substituents on the quinoxaline residues. Their twisted structure has been demonstrated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, absorption, fluorescence, electrochemical and theoretical studies shine light on the effects of the substituents and twists on the optoelectronic and redox properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;Doped Ni(OH)2 Grown on Nickel Mesh by Electrodeposition for Efficient Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 electrodeposited on nickel mesh was prepared for efficient alkaline OER, in which Ni3+ active components could be formed in electrochemical reconstruction.







Abstract
Designing highly excellent and stable catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually pivotal for clean energy development. In this work, a heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 (Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1) was developed via simple one&#8208;step electrodeposition onto nickel mesh. The heterogeneous interface structure generates sufficient active sites, significantly improving OER performance with an overpotential of 174&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10), while Tafel slope is only 43.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. In particular, Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1 is still able to operate stably at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h without obvious potential decay. The oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ was detected by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, proving that the heterogeneous catalyst could stabilize the high&#8208;valence state of nickel as active sites to its superior OER performance. This work provides a convenient synthetic strategy for forming heterogeneous catalysts toward efficient water electrolysis.

Golden time: 2&#8208;Aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides react after diazotization with gold to give 3&#8208;acylindoles and/or Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines. DFT calculations show that the arylAu intermediate evolve via external nucleophilic attack over the alkyne, which is more favorable energetically than an insertion process. One of the Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines crystallized with [Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl]&#8722; displaying short Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C contacts, that are maintained in solution.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot diazotization/gold&#8208;mediated cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides is described. After diazotization, Me2SAuCl triggers an oxy&#8208; and/or chloroarylation of the alkyne moiety, resulting in the formation of 3&#8208;acylindoles and/or Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show the significant energetic preference of both processes over an insertion pathway. Notably, a Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indoline crystallized with [Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl],&#8722; exhibiting Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C short contacts.

         <title>Biochar&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Porous Carbon as Tellurium Host for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Tellurium Batteries</title>

The Te@PC&#8208;MS composites based on the biomass carbon from mangosteen shell exhibit the superior K+&#8208;storing performances. The existence of abundance of micro&#8208;/mesopores in the hierarchical structure could effectively alleviates volume fluctuance during K&#8208;Te battery operation.







Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion battery is promising for its high abundance and low redox potential. As a conversion cathode, Te possesses high conductivity and theoretical volumetric capacity to couple with potassium. The stubborn issues of K&#8208;Te battery focus on the large volume change and rapid structure degradation of Te. Herein, we produce biomass carbon from mangosteen shell in a facile method, and obtain a hierarchical porous host with abundance of micropores and mesopores, which is obviously beneficial for hosting Te during K+ storage in K&#8208;Te battery. The specific capacity reach to 560&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the initial cycle at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and remained 83.8&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. Impressively, at a high current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the specific capacity still remained 62.6&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycle. These results endow such strategy an efficient way for the development of K&#8208;Te batteries.

         <title>Linear bis&#8208;Coordinate Silver(I) and Iodine(I) Complexes with R3R2R1N Tertiary Amines</title>

Racemic prochiral NR1R2R3 amines become chiral with opposite absolute configurations of the sp3 nitrogen atom &#8216;&#8217;locked&#8217;&#8217; in meso&#8208;[R3R2R1N&#8722;I&#8722;NR1R2R3]+, halogen(I) complexes, which are described as such based on the X&#8208;ray crystallography data of their parent meso&#8208;[R3R2R1N&#8722;Ag&#8722;NR1R2R3]+ complexes.







Abstract
Homoleptic [L&#8722;I&#8722;L]+ iodine(I) complexes (where L is a R3R2R1N tertiary amine) were synthesized via the [L&#8722;Ag&#8722;L]+&#8594; [L&#8722;I&#8722;L]+ cation exchange reaction. In solution, the amines form [R3R2R1N&#8722;Ag&#8722;NR1R2R3]+ silver(I) complexes, which crystallize out from solution as the meso&#8208;[L&#8722;Ag&#8722;L]+complexes, as characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The subsequent [L&#8722;I&#8722;L]+ iodine(I) analogues were extremely reactive and could not be isolated in the solid state. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the Ag+&#8722;N and I+&#8722;N interaction energies in silver(I) and iodine(I) complexes, with the former ranging from &#8722;80 to &#8722;100&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and latter from &#8722;260 to &#8722;279&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures revealed Ag+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C&#960; and Ag+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C short contacts between the silver(I) cation and flexible N&#8208;alkyl/N&#8208;aryl groups, which are the first of their kind in such precursor complexes.

In solution, the amines form [R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8722;Ag&#8722;NR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; silver(I) complexes, which crystallize out from solution as the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-[L&#8722;Ag&#8722;L]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;complexes, as characterized by X-ray crystallography. The subsequent [L&#8722;I&#8722;L]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; iodine(I) analogues were extremely reactive and could not be isolated in the solid state. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N and I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N interaction energies in silver(I) and iodine(I) complexes, with the former ranging from &#8722;80 to &#8722;100&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and latter from &#8722;260 to &#8722;279&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The X-ray crystal structures revealed Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C&lt;sub&gt;&#960;&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C short contacts between the silver(I) cation and flexible N-alkyl/N-aryl groups, which are the first of their kind in such precursor complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Bioluminescence of &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;Shaped Firefly Luciferin Analogues Based on A Novel Benzobisthiazole Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 4&#8201;new D&#8208;luciferin analogues based upon a &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped benzobisthiazole core, with structurally and electronically different amines is described. Their bioluminescence and photophysical characteristics were determined. With a variety of luciferases, the new &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins provided longer wavelengths than D&#8208;luciferin. The combination of luciferase PpyLuc and the pyrrolidine analogue showed the longest bioluminescence wavelength at 636&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The design of &#960;&#8208;extended conjugation &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped red shifted bioluminescent D&#8208;luciferin analogues based on a novel benzobisthiazole core is described. The divergent synthetic route allowed access to a range of amine donor substituents through an SNAr reaction. In spectroscopic studies, the &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;shaped luciferins exhibited narrower optical band gaps, more red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra than D&#8208;luciferin. Their bioluminescence characteristics were recorded against four different luciferases (PpyLuc, FlucRed, CBR2 and PLR3). With native luciferase PpyLuc, the &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;shaped luciferins demonstrated more red&#8208;shifted emissions than D&#8208;luciferin (&#955;bl=561&#8197;nm) by 60 to 80&#8197;nm. In addition, the benzobisthiazole luciferins showed a wide range of bioluminescence spectra from the visible light region (&#955;bl=500&#8197;nm) to the nIR window (&gt;650&#8197;nm). The computational results validate the design concept which can be used as a guide for further novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues based upon other &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;shaped heterocyclic cores.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of NiI from NiII with H2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiI complex directly from H2: This paper demonstrates for the first time that a NiI complex can be synthesized in single step from the reaction of a NiII complex with H2 at room temperature. The NiI complex can catalytically reduce N&#8208;methyl acridinium ions. The acridinium ion reduction, which demonstrates electron transfer from H2, rather than hydride transfer is discussed.







Abstract
Chemists have long sought to regulate the reactivity of H2, to yield hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, or electrons on demand. One source of inspiration for achieving this control is [NiFe]hydrogenase ([NiFe]H2ase), which reacts with H2 to form various hydrogen active species such as NiIII hydride species, NiII hydride species, and NiI low&#8208;valent species. Chemists have attempted to synthesize these hydrogen active species not only as models for the active species of [NiFe]H2ase, but also as electron transfer catalysts. However, the synthesis of NiI complex directly from H2 has not been reported. This paper reports the first example of a single&#8208;step synthesis of a NiI complex, via reaction of a NiII complex with H2, stable for over 3&#8197;months at room temperature and we further demonstrate a reductive coupling of acridinium ions as part of a reaction cycle.

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light Driven Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Oxy&#8208;phosphinylation of Activated Alkenes for &#946;&#8208;Ketophosphine Oxide Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A blue light driven iron&#8208;catalyzed oxy&#8208;phosphinylation of activated alkenes with secondary phosphine oxides under air at room temperature led to &#946;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides in 43&#8211;97&#8201;% isolated yields. The proposed mechanism involved a blue light promoted aerobic process catalyzed by iron which generated a phosphorus radical from the starting secondary phosphine oxide.







Abstract
We have developed an original blue&#8208;light mediated iron&#8208;catalyzed oxy&#8208;phosphinylation of activated alkenes by secondary phosphine oxides under air at room temperature. Various &#946;&#8208;ketophosphine oxides were then obtained in 43&#8211;97&#8201;% isolated yields. Control experiments revealed that radical process is involved in the mechanism.

         <title>Control and Transferability of Magnetic Interactions in Supramolecular Structures: Trimers of {Cr7Ni} Antiferromagnetic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical coupling of antiferromagnetic rings into hetero&#8208;spin supramolecular structures is reported by different routes: control of molecule&#8230;molecule magnetic interactions is demonstrated with transferability of parameters from simpler building blocks.







Abstract
A synthetic strategy is demonstrated to prepare two distinct trimers of antiferromagnetically coupled {Cr7Ni} rings, substantially varying the magnetic interactions between the spin centres. The interactions were studied using multi&#8208;frequency cw EPR: in a trimer linked via non&#8208;covalent H&#8208;bonding interactions no measurable interaction between rings was seen, while in a trimer linked via iso&#8208;nicotinate groups isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of +0.42 and &#8722;0.8&#8197;GHz, respectively, were observed. The latter are the same as those for a simpler hetero&#8208;dimer system, showing how the spin&#8208;spin interactions can be built in a predictable and modular manner in these systems.

         <title>Diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative (4+2) Cycloaddition Reactions of 4&#8208;Vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;Nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes</title>

The Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative (4+2) cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;H&#8208; and N&#8208;Ts&#8208;4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanones with 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enyne dipolarophiles gives valuable tetrahydroquinoline products in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities. These cycloaddition reactions constitute the first example of a dipolarophile with a single strong activating group (i.&#8201;e. 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes) reacting with 4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanone derived Pd&#8208;stabilized zwitterionic dipoles.







Abstract
A formal palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative (4+2) cycloaddition reaction between 4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes has been developed to produce highly valuable, densely functionalized tetrahydroquinolines in moderate to excellent yields with high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The optimised protocol tolerates a range of substituted 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes, which represent an under&#8208;utilized class of dipolarophile for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cycloadditions. The employed reaction methodology facilitates efficient cycloaddition with both N&#8208;H&#8208; and N&#8208;Ts&#8208;4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanone dipole precursors. The stereochemistry of the major and minor diastereomeric (4+2) cycloadducts was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. A mechanistic rationale for the high intrinsic diastereoselectivity and preliminary enantioselective experiments are also presented. The tetrahydroquinoline cycloadduct products feature numerous pendant functionalities, including a vinyl handle, an internal alkyne motif and a nitro functionality (which functions as a latent C&#8208;3 nitrogen substituent) for further synthetic manipulations.

         <title>Pioneering the Power of Twin Bonds in a Revolutionary Double Bond Formation. Unveiling the True Identity of o&#8208;Carboryne as o&#8208;Carborene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational evidence shows that despite the similarity of o&#8208;carboryne and o&#8208;benzyne, the nature of the C&#8722;C bond generated between two adjacent carbons that lose H atoms is different. While in o&#8208;benzyne the C&#8722;C bond behaves as a triple bond, in o&#8208;carboryne the C&#8722;C bond is a double bond.







Abstract
The homolytic elimination of two H atoms from two adjacent carbons in benzene results in the aromatic product o&#8208;benzyne. In a similar way, the homolytic elimination of two H atoms from the two adjacent carbons in 1,2&#8208;C2B10H12 results in the aromatic product o&#8208;carboryne. In this work, we provide experimental and computational evidences that despite the similarity of o&#8208;carboryne and o&#8208;benzyne, the nature of the C&#8722;C bond generated between two adjacent carbons that lose H atoms is different. While in o&#8208;benzyne the C&#8722;C bond behaves as a triple bond, in o&#8208;carboryne the C&#8722;C bond is a double bond. Therefore, we must stop naming 1,2&#8208;dehydro&#8208;o&#8208;carboryne as o&#8208;carboryne but instead call it o&#8208;carborene.

A solid&#8208;state generation method for diarylisonaphthofurans using 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydronaphthofuranols has been developed. The generated reactive molecules were stable in the solid state and could be stocked without any precaution. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a typical quinoidal structure. Furthermore, mechanochemical Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylisonaphthofurans with epoxynaphthalene gave synthetically attractive diepoxypentacenes.

         <title>Iron(II) Complexes of P3&#8208;Chain Ligands: Structural Diversity</title>

Iron(II) complexes containing a R2P&#8722;P&#8722;PR2 unit were synthetized. The binding modes of the triphosphane ligands can be changed by the size of the substituents. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Iron(II) complexes containing ligands with a R2P&#8722;P&#8722;PR2 unit were synthesized by metathesis reactions. With R=tBu, a mixture of two isomers is formed; in one of them, the terminal phosphorus binds to the Fe center (ylidic structure), while in the other one, the central P atom is linked to Fe. Starting from differently functionalized parent triphosphanes and corresponding functionalized Fe complexes, the ratio of isomers does not change. The outcome of the reaction and therefore the binding modes of the triphosphane ligands in the resulting compounds can be influenced by the size of the substituents. In the case of R=iPr a chelate complex is formed (both terminal P atoms are linked to the Fe center). Applying the mixed&#8208;substituted triphosphane, the ylidic structure of the resulting complex is preferred. The new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in solution and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in solid&#8208;state. The synthetic work was supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>The First Planar, Not Twisted, Distannene &#8722; A Structural Alkene Analog. Synthesis, Isolation and X&#8208;ray Crystallography Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the first planar non&#8208;twisted distannene 6 is reported. The X&#8208;ray molecular structure of 6 reveals a planar geometry of both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn=359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn bond of 2.599&#8197;&#197; among all known acyclic distannenes. Thus, 6 is the first distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene.







Abstract
The tetrasilyl&#8208;substituted distannene, (tBu2HSi)2Sn=Sn(SiHtBu2)2 6, was synthesized by mild thermolysis (70&#8201;&#176;C in hexane) of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydridosilyl)stannane 4. The X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of 6 reveals the following unusual structural properties: a planar geometry around both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn=359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn double bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn double bond of 2.599&#8197;&#197; among all acyclic distannenes. Thus, compound 6 is the first reported distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene. Reactions of 6 with CCl4 or with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene to produce 1,2&#8208;dichlorodistannane 9 and the [2+4] cycloadduct 10, respectively, are characteristic for a Sn=Sn double bond.

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>

NiCo2O4/CF maintains the flexibility of the carbon foam framework during a simple hydrothermal and annealing process. Applying foam carbon as a standalone electrode overcomes the limitation of low specific capacitance. It addresses the significant challenge of NiCo2O4 nanoparticle aggregation, achieving suitable specific capacitance and efficient microwave absorption performance.







Abstract
Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor&#8216;s electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5&#8197;F/g at 1&#8197;A/g. When the current density was set to 1&#8197;A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7&#8197;F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10&#8197;A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2&#8201;% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5&#8197;W/kg, an energy density of 22.1&#8197;Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material&#8216;s microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.

         <title>Fate of Oxidation States at Actinide Centers in Redox&#8208;Active Ligand Systems Governed by Energy Levels of 5&#8201;f Orbitals</title>

The direct reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV is facilitated by the interaction of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand H2(tBu&#8208;pdiop), while the complexation of UVIO22+ with H2(tBu&#8208;pdiop) did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+. The different reactivity can be explained by the decrease of the energy of the 5&#8201;f orbitals in Np compared to those in U.







Abstract
We report the formation of a NpIV complex from the complexation of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722;=2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)iminomethyl]pyridine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the direct complexation&#8208;induced chemical reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV. In contrast, the complexation of UVIO22+ with tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722; did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+, not even after the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reduction of [UVIO2(tBu&#8208;pdiop)]. This contrast between the Np and U systems may be ascribed to the decrease of the energy of the 5&#8201;f orbitals in Np compared to those in U. The present findings indicate that the redox chemistry between UVIO22+ and NpVIO22+ should be clearly differentiated in redox&#8208;active ligand systems.

The direct dearomatization of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with in&#8208;situ generated ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). The reported convergent method allows the use of readily available simple 1&#8208;naphthols without pre&#8208;functionalization, furnishing a variety of naphthopyran derivatives in good yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
We disclose a catalytic, enantioselective dearomative reaction of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols, which poses a synthetic challenge to organic chemists because of the relative ease of rearomatization via the elimination of a proton.

         <title>Utilising the Nanozymatic Activity of Copper&#8208;Functionalised Mesoporous C3N5 for Sensing Biomolecules</title>

Copper&#8208;functionalised mesoporous carbon nitride which has been synthesised with a higher nitrogen content (Cu&#8722;C3N5) and applied in the biosensing of various biomolecules, including glutathione and glucose.







Abstract
Designing unique nanomaterials for the selective sensing of biomolecules is of significant interest in the field of nanobiotechnology. In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of ordered Cu nanoparticle&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 that has unique peroxidase&#8208;like nanozymatic activity for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of glucose and glutathione. A nano hard&#8208;templating technique together with the in&#8208;situ polymerisation and self&#8208;assembly of Cu and high N&#8208;containing CN precursor was adopted to introduce mesoporosity as well as high N and Cu content in mesoporous C3N5. Due to the ordered structure and highly dispersed Cu in the mesoporous C3N5, a large enhancement of the peroxidase mimetic activity in the oxidation of a redox dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide could be obtained. Additionally, the optimised Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 exhibited excellent sensitivity to glutathione with a low detection limit of 2.0&#8197;ppm. The strong peroxidase activity of the Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 was also effectively used for the sensing of glucose with a detection limit of 0.4&#8197;mM through glucose oxidation with glucose oxidase. This unique Cu&#8208;functionalised mesoporous C3N5 has the potential for detecting various molecules in the environment as well as for next&#8208;generation glucose and glutathione diagnostic devices.

A cycloaddition&#8211;retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) click reaction using nitrogen end&#8208;capped oligoynes is demonstrated. The reaction with tetracyanoetylene (TCNE) is fully regioselective and leads to TCBD (tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) end&#8208;capped molecules. The optical and electronic properties of adducts were investigated and rationalized using DFT calculations.







Abstract
This study shows the first example of cycloaddition&#8211;retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) click reaction involving nitrogen end&#8208;capped push&#8208;pull oligoynes. The reported CA&#8208;RE reaction with TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) is fully regioselective and leads exclusively to the unprecedented TCBD (tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) end&#8208;capped carbon rods. The molecular structure of the products was unambiguously confirmed using X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction and their optical and electronic properties were investigated experimentally and rationalized using DFT (density functional theory) calculations.

         <title>Poly(arylene iminoborane)s, Analogues of Poly(arylene vinylene) with a BN&#8208;Doped Backbone: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers, copolymers, and oligomers from combinations of backbone&#8208;BN&#8208;doped poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and poly(thiophene vinylene) (PTV) with tailored properties have been prepared by a modular approach. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type backbone structure gives rise to efficient solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior.







Abstract
Despite the great success of the concept of doping organic compounds with BN units to access new materials with tailored properties, its use in polymer chemistry has only been realized quite recently. Herein, we present a comprehensive study of oligo&#8208; and poly(arylene iminoborane)s comprising a backbone of phenylene or thiophene moieties, as well as combinations thereof, linked via B=N units. The novel polymers can be regarded as BN analogues of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) or poly(thiophene vinylene) (PTV) or their copolymers. Our modular synthetic approach allowed us to prepare four polymers and 12 monodisperse oligomers with modulated electronic properties. Alternating electron&#8208;releasing diaminoarylene and electron&#8208;accepting diborylarylene building blocks gave rise to a pronounced donor&#8208;acceptor character. Effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the arylene iminoborane backbone is evidenced by systematic bathochromic shifts of the low&#8208;energy UV&#8208;vis absorption maximum with increasing chain length, which is furthermore supported by crystallographic and computational investigations. Furthermore, all compounds investigated show emission of visible light in the solid state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to the presence of partially flexible linear B=N linkages in the backbone.

         <title>Synergistic Activation of Inert Iron Oxide Basal Planes through Heterostructure Formation and Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs catalyst was synthesized via a facile solvothermal reaction and subsequent annealing process. The catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability and hydrogen evolution activity, which can be attributed to the synergistic activation of the basal planes of iron oxide through heterostructure engineering and nickel doping. Furthermore, the incorporation of nickel into the catalyst conferred low&#8208;temperature resistance, with high HER activity even at 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Iron oxides have emerged as a very promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to precious metal catalysts for hydrogen production. However, the inert basal plane of iron oxides needs to be activated to enhance their catalytic efficiency. In this study, we employed heterostructure engineering and doped nickel to cooperatively activate the basal planes of iron oxide (Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs) to achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent basic HER activity and stability, such as an extremely low overpotential of 43&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density and corresponding Tafel slope of 58.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The increase in electrocatalyst activity and acceleration of hydrogen precipitation kinetics arises from the dual modulation of Ni doping and heterostructure, which not only modulates the electrocatalyst&#8216;s electronic structure, but also increases the number and exposure of active sites. Remarkably, the generation of heterogeneous structure makes the catalyst se. The Ni&#8208;doped catalyst has not only increased HER activity but also low&#8208;temperature resistance. These results suggest that the synergistic activation of inert iron oxide basal planes through heterostructure formation and doping is a feasible strategy. Furthermore, for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, this technique can be extended to other non&#8208;noble metal oxides.

Selective tandem quinolines dearomatization/functionalization is a huge challenge. We show here that the low&#8208;valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 is able to catalyze such bis&#8208;borylation process. NMR and labelling studies prove a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration/Markovnikov hydroboration cascade, starting from an in&#8197;situ formed paramagnetic complex. DFT highlights the importance of a cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction, and bring rationalizations on the C4 selectivity.







Abstract
We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8722;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in&#8197;situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.

         <title>Cover Feature: An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations with Hydrogen Peroxide (Chem. Eur. J. 69/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
The depicted macrocyclic iron complex is a highly active, biomimetic oxidation catalyst in water at pH&#8197;7. The iron centre is coordinated by four unique, hybrid, pyridinium amidate/amidate nitrogen donors. Upon activation by the green oxidant hydrogen peroxide, the iron complex is converted to an aggressive intermediate (represented by the piranha) that very rapidly oxidises the surrogate pollutant orange&#8197;II to colourless products, with the iron returning to its FeIII resting state. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;J. Wright and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301548).

Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid polymers with a BN&#8208;doped backbone have been developed using a modular synthetic approach. By combining various building blocks (i.e., the puzzle pieces), p&#8208;conjugated polymers and monodisperse oligomers with modulated properties, including solid&#8208;state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) at tailored wavelengths, can be accessed. This is illustrated by the polymer sequence and the background color, depending on the incorporated building blocks that were put together. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Helten et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302767).

Introduction of monofluorocarbene synthons has emerged as an important strategy for the construction of fluorine&#8208;containing products. This review summarizes the recent advances in the synthetic applications of monofluorinated carbenes, carbenoids, ylides, and related species.







Abstract
The synthesis of monofluorinated compounds is of great interest because of the vast applications of organofluorine compounds. Recently, the introduction of monofluorocarbene synthons has emerged as an important strategy for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing products. In contrast to direct fluorination, in which C&#8722;F bonds are formed, the use of monofluorinated carbenes and related reactive species involves C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bond formation while delivering valuable fluorine atoms into the target structure. Owing to increased knowledge on carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formations, monofluorinated carbenes have enormous potential for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds, which, in our opinion, has not yet been fully exploited. This review summarizes the recent advances in the synthetic applications of monofluorinated carbenes, carbenoids, ylides, and related species.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis: Tellurium, the Last Frontier?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 69, December 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the importance of chalcogen bonding in organic synthesis through a compilation of tellurium derivatives used up&#8208;to&#8208;now in catalysis. These powerful chalcogen bond donors were shown to activate numerous kind of substrates by non&#8208;covalent interaction with functional groups such as chlorides, carbonyls, imines, epoxides, alcohols and nitro derivatives.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is the non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between chalcogen atoms as Lewis acid sites and atoms or groups of atoms able to behave as Lewis bases through their lone pair or &#960; electrons. Analogously to its sister halogen bonding, the high directionality of this interaction was implemented for precise structural organizations in the solid state and in solution. Regarding catalysis, ChB is now accepted as a new mode of activation as demonstrated by the increased number of examples in the last five years. In the family of ChB catalysts, those based on tellurium rapidly appeared to overcome their lighter sulfur and selenium counterparts.

     alt="Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis: Tellurium, the Last Frontier?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review highlights the importance of chalcogen bonding in organic synthesis through a compilation of tellurium derivatives used up-to-now in catalysis. These powerful chalcogen bond donors were shown to activate numerous kind of substrates by non-covalent interaction with functional groups such as chlorides, carbonyls, imines, epoxides, alcohols and nitro derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is the non-covalent interaction occurring between chalcogen atoms as Lewis acid sites and atoms or groups of atoms able to behave as Lewis bases through their lone pair or &#960; electrons. Analogously to its sister halogen bonding, the high directionality of this interaction was implemented for precise structural organizations in the solid state and in solution. Regarding catalysis, ChB is now accepted as a new mode of activation as demonstrated by the increased number of examples in the last five years. In the family of ChB catalysts, those based on tellurium rapidly appeared to overcome their lighter sulfur and selenium counterparts. In this review, we highlight the Lewis acid properties of tellurium-based derivatives in solution and summarize the start-of-the-art of their applications in catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of supramolecular templates in aligning atomically precise heterometal arrays is important for pursuing functional materials. Herein, we report that a bilayered supramolecular tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer functions as an effective template in the construction of a heterometallic gold(I)&#8208;silver(I) macrocyclic cluster [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8211;]2&#8211;AuI6AgI6. X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analysis showed that a crown&#8208;like AuI6AgI6 macrocycle is aligned around two parallelly stacked &#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8211; moieties hold together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Theoretical calculations revealed that the [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8211;]2 motif dominantly contributes to the near&#8208;occupied orbitals in the electronic structure, which is closely related to its luminescence properties. This work demonstrates that the supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites may present a facile approach in the construction of functional metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectricity and Related Properties of Nitratecadmate(II) Hybrid with Metal&#8208;Vacancy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6. The coordination twist of the Cd&#8208;vacancy leads to instability of the lattices, structural phase transitions and excellent ferroelectricity. This result reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectric complexes.







Abstract
All crystals are not ideal, and many of their properties are often determined not by the regular arrangement of atoms, but by the irregular arrangement of crystal defects. Many properties of materials can be controlled effectively by proper use of solid defects. By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure (H2dabco)(NH4)(NO3)3 (dabco=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1) with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6 (2). It exhibits a ferroelectric&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at 261&#8197;K. A comparison of the various&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structures indicates that the coordination twist of Cd2+ ion leads to instability of the lattices and excellent ferroelectricity. These findings reveal that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectricity and may start the chemistry of metal&#8208;vacancy coordination compounds. These findings reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an effective means to tune the symmetry and produce ferroelectricity.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;driven Distinct Nanomechanical, Optical, Photophysical, and Conducting Properties in a Benzothiophene&#8208;quinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphic forms of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinolone&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate with distinct packing arrangements and interactions, vary in their nanomechanical response, photophysical, optical waveguiding, and conducting properties, highlight the significant role of polymorphism in modulating the microstructures in molecular materials and thereby their functional properties. DFT calculations on the single molecule and crystal dimorphs corroborate the experimental photophysical and conductive findings.







Abstract
Polymorphic forms of organic conjugated small molecules, with their unique molecular shapes, packing arrangements, and interaction patterns, provide an excellent opportunity to uncover how their microstructures influence their observable properties. Ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate (BZQ) exists as dimorphs with distinct crystal habits &#8211; blocks (BZB) and needles (BZN). The crystal forms differ in their molecular arrangements &#8211; BZB has a slip&#8208;stacked column&#8208;like structure in contrast to a zig&#8208;zag crystal packing with limited &#960;&#8208;overlap in BZN. The BZB crystals characterized by extended &#960;&#8208;stacking along [100] demonstrated semiconductor behavior, whereas the BZN, with its zig&#8208;zag crystal packing and limited stacking characteristics, was reckoned as an insulator. Monotropically related crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties, with BZB crystals being considerably softer than BZN crystals. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties. Excitation of these crystals using a 532&#8197;nm laser confirmed the propagation of elastically scattered photons (green) and the subsequent generation of inelastically scattered (orange) photons by the crystals. Further, the dimorphs display dissimilar photoluminescence properties; they are both blue&#8208;emissive, but BZN displays twice the quantum yield of BZB. The study underscores the integral role of polymorphism in modulating the mechanical, photophysical, and conducting properties of functional molecular materials. Importantly, our findings reveal the existence of light&#8208;emitting crystal polymorphs with varying electric conductivity, a relatively scarce phenomenon in the literature.

         <title>Bisurea&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Tunable Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

2,4&#8208;Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) was used as starting material to obtain functional and desymmetrized supramolecular monomers that assemble into fibrous structures in water. The resulting supramolecular polymers are dynamic, biocompatible and stable in cellular media, which opens up the use of the UT motif to access tunable biomaterials.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea&#8208;based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8211;5 monomers in the cross&#8208;section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co&#8208;assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water&#8208;compatibility and no toxicity for different cell&#8208;lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea&#8208;based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.

         <title>Enzymatic Resolution and Decarboxylative Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic resolution of &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl esters gives recovered ester and &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl acid in high enantiomeric purity. Decarboxylative functionalization provides access to a wide range of optically active sulfoxides in both enantiomeric forms.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl esters can be readily prepared through thiol substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromo esters followed by oxidation to the sulfoxide. Enzymatic resolution with lipoprotein lipase provides both the unreacted esters and corresponding &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl carboxylic acids in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Subsequent decarboxylative halogenation, dihalogenation, trihalogenation and cross&#8208;coupling gives rise to functionalized sulfoxides. The method has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of a potent inhibitor of 15&#8208;prostaglandin dehydrogenase.

         <title>Cooperation between p&#8208;Block Elements and Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Stoichiometric and Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Ignoble&#8221; prized: The use of redox&#8208;active ligands that behave as electron reservoirs and are able to donate or accept electrons on demand during a catalytic cycle has emerged as a powerful approach to engage cheap early transition metals in catalytic transformations traditionally reserved for their &#8220;noble cousins&#8221;. This concept article explores the possibilities that are opened by the extrapolation of that strategy to the design of catalysts based on p&#8208;block elements.







Abstract
The relevance acquired by redox&#8208;active ligands in modern catalysis stems from their facile delivery and acceptance of electrons, either to the metal they coordinate to, or directly to an incoming substrate that also binds the central metal. Doing that, they generate coordinated radicals and provide access to more than one spin state during the catalytic cycle. As a consequence, the new reaction barriers are reduced when compared to similar processes that are restricted to a single spin surface. The principles that govern this genuine approach to catalyst design are well&#8208;established, and their implementation has allowed the development of synthetically useful catalytic transformations; however, the extension of the concept to species in which p&#8208;block elements take the role of central atoms remains largely underdeveloped. Through discussion of the key achievements and recent progress, this Concept Article highlights this original approach to designing (organo)catalysts, discloses the progress achieved, and also reveals the many shortcomings that still exist in the field.

         <title>Dihydroguaiazulenide Complexes and Catalysts of Group 8&#8211;12 Transition Metals: Ligands from Renewable Feedstock Replace, even Outmatch Petrochemical Based Cyclopentadienyl Chemistry</title>

Cyclopentadienyl synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from guaiazulene (Gua) and LiH is used in ligand transfer towards selected homo&#8208; and heteroleptic group&#8197;8&#8211;10 metal complexes. Replacement of classical petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry by this renewable resources based Cp anion is not only cheaper. A representative precatalyst, [(8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)PtMe3], has proven an even much higher activity in photoactivated hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;octene at only 5&#8197;ppm load and 96&#8201;% conversion compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst [(CpR)GuaPtMe3] (R=H, Me). The platinum consumption could be reduced by about 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
We present an in&#8208;depth study of the sterically demanding Cp&#8208;synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from natural product guaiazulene (Gua) as a ligand transfer reagent towards late transition metal complex precursors. The synthesis and full characterization of selected, essentially unexplored homo&#8208; and heteroleptic 8&#8208;H&#8208;guaiazulenide complexes of iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, platinum, copper and zinc are discussed in detail. In order to demonstrate their potential in catalytic applications, [(GuaH)PtMe3] was selected. The latter proved an even higher catalytic activity in light induced olefin hydrosilylation at catalyst loads as low as 5&#8197;ppm than classical [CpPtMe3] in a typical test reaction of silicone elastomer fabrication. Our results demonstrate that traditional petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry and catalysis can be replaced, sometimes even outmatched by superior catalysts based on cheap building blocks from renewable feedstock.

         <title>Multifunctional Photoelectroactive Materials for Optoelectronic Applications Based on Thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazines and Thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers containing electron donor units based on a carbazole&#8208;thiophene derivative and three different acceptor units (Bz, Pz, Tz) were synthesized and characterized. These structural modifications promote better &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization due to a progressive enhancement of the quinoidal character (Bz&lt;Pz&lt;Tz) and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel family of symmetrical thiophene&#8208;based small molecules with a Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor structure. These compounds feature three different acceptor units: benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Bz), thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazine (Pz), and thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazole (Tz), coupled with electron donor units based on a carbazole&#8208;thiophene derivative. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we investigate how the molecular geometry and strength of the central acceptor unit impact the redox and spectroscopic properties. Notably, the incorporation of Pz and Tz moieties induces a significant redshift in the absorption and emission spectra, which extend into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, simultaneously reducing their energy gaps (~1.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;eV). This shift is attributed to the increased coplanarity of the oligomeric inner core, both in the ground (S0) and excited (S1) states, due to the enhanced quinoidal character as supported by bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) analysis. These structural changes promote better &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices. Notably, we show that Pz&#8208; and Tz&#8208;containing molecules exhibit NIR electrochromic behavior and present ambivalent character in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Finally, theoretical calculations suggest that these molecules could serve as effective two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) probes, further expanding their potential in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Non&#8208;Solvated Dialkylalumanyl Anion and XPS Characterization of Al(I) and Al(II) Species
</title>

         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;solvated alkyl&#8208;substituted Al(I) anion dimer was synthesized by a reduction of haloalumane precursor using a mechanochemical method. The crystallographic and theoretical analysis revealed its structure and electronic properties. Experimental XPS analysis of the Al(I) anions with reference compounds revealed the lower Al&#8197;2p binding energy corresponds to the lower oxidation state of Al species. It should be emphasized that the experimentally obtained XPS binding energies were reproduced by delta SCF calculations and were linearly correlated with NPA charges and 2p orbital energies.

         <title>Barbier Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission towards Fully Substituted Polyethylene Analogues with Non&#8208;Traditional Intrinsic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radius than fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated.







Abstract
The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on the variety and quantity of substitutions. Generally, polyethylene can only be fully substituted with fluorine atoms, mainly e.&#8201;g., polytetrafluoroethylene and nafion, because atomic radius of fluorine atom is small enough. The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radii than a fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with intriguing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors. Through Barbier polymerization of diphenyldichloromethane and different peroxyesters in the presence of Mg in one pot, a series of FSPEAs, including polytriphenylethanol (PTPE), polydiphenylfurylethanol (PDPFE), polydiphenylthiophenylethanol (PDPTE) and polydiphenylnaphthylethanol (PDPNE) have been successfully prepared. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated. Therefore, this work opens up a new approach for the molecular design of FSPEA with non&#8208;conjugated luminescence, which may cause inspirations to different research fields like polyolefin and luminescent materials.

         <title>An Offset Patterned Cross&#8208;&#946; Structure in Assemblies of C3&#8208;Symmetric Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Offset patterned cross&#8208;&#946; architecture arises in C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphile assemblies as a result of spatial limitations of the &#946;&#8208;sheet dimensions.







Abstract
Developing peptide&#8208;based materials with controlled morphology is a critical theme of soft matter research. Herein, we report the formation of a novel, patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure formed by self&#8208;assembled C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles based on diphenylalanine and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA). The cross&#8208;&#946; motif is an abundant structural element in amyloid fibrils and aggregates of fibril&#8208;forming peptides, including diphenylalanine. The incorporation of topological constraints on one edge of the diphenylalanine fragment limits the number of &#946;&#8208;strands in &#946;&#8208;sheets and leads to the creation of an unconventional offset&#8208;patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure consisting of short 3&#215;2 parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets stabilized by phenylalanine zippers. In the reported assembly, two patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structures bind parallel arrays of BTA stacks in a superstructure within a single&#8208;molecule&#8208;thick nanoribbon. In addition to a threefold network of hydrogen bonds in the BTA stack, each molecule becomes simultaneously bound by hydrogen bonds from three &#946;&#8208;sheets and four phenylalanine zippers. The diffuse layer of alkyl chains with terminal polar groups prevents the nanoribbons from merging and stabilizes cross&#8208;&#946;&#8208;structure in water. Our results provide a simple approach to the incorporation of novel patterned cross&#8208;&#946; motifs into supramolecular superstructures and shed light on the general mechanism of &#946;&#8208;sheet formation in C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles.

         <title>Intramolecular Carboxyamidation of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered O&#8208;Acylhydroxamates through Formation of Fe(III)&#8208;Nitrenoids</title>

Zip and shift: The intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration can generate a wide variety of N,O&#8208;containing heterocycles. DFT study suggests the Fe&#8208;nitrenoid intermediate preferentially reacts in a radical manifold to mediates a stepwise C&#8722;N/C&#8722;O bond formation rather than a concerted [3+2] cycloaddition mechanism.







Abstract
We developed intramolecular carboxyamidations of alkyne&#8208;tethered O&#8208;acylhydroxamates followed by either thermally induced spontaneous or 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine&#8208;catalyzed O&#8594;O or O&#8594;N acyl group migration. Under iron&#8208;catalyzed conditions, the carboxyamidation products were generated in high yield from both Z&#8208;alkene and arene&#8208;tethered substrates. DFT calculations indicate that the iron&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation proceeds via a stepwise mechanism involving iron&#8208;imidyl radical cyclization followed by intramolecular acyloxy transfer from the iron center to the alkenyl radical center to furnish the cis&#8208;carboxyamidation product. Upon treatment with 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine, the Z&#8208;alkene&#8208;tethered carboxyamidation products underwent selective O&#8594;O acyl migration to generate 2&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;5&#8208;acyl pyrroles. Thermal O&#8594;N acyl migration occurs during carboxyamidation if the Z&#8208;alkene linker contains an alkyl or an aryl substituent at the &#946;&#8208;position of the carbonyl group. On the other hand, the arene linker&#8208;containing compounds selectively undergo O&#8594;N acyl migration to generate N&#8208;acyl&#8208;3&#8208;acylisoindolinones, and the corresponding O&#8594;O acyl migration forming isoindole derivatives was not observed.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping sunlight energy into chemical bonds has become an important method for storing renewable energy and releasing it on demand. To illustrate the new catalyst&#8208;testing protocol, a cyclic road shows the photoisomerization process trapping sunlight (top) and the back&#8208;conversion catalytic reaction releasing heat. The bottom wheel indicates that up to 27 different catalysts were studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Funes&#8208;Ardoiz, D. Sampedro and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303230).

To illustrate the new catalyst-testing protocol, a cyclic road shows the photoisomerization process trapping sunlight (top) and the back-conversion catalytic reaction releasing heat. The bottom wheel indicates that up to 27 different catalysts were studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Funes-Ardoiz, D.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular chemistry was successfully applied in highly flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs to gain control over structural dynamics and gas/vapor sorption properties. The reported materials display a rare continuous&#8208;breathing behaviour and an unprecedented gas/vapor trapping property, resembling the function of Venus&#8208;flytrap, and could be used for the selective removal of harmful gases and volatile organic compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;N. Trikalitis and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302709).

         <title>S&#8208;induced Phase Change Forming In2O3/In2S3 Heterostructure for Photoelectrochemical Glucose Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface construction through experimental control of the introduced anions allows the tuning of the energy bands of photoanode materials. The cooperative energy band and electronical structure of In2O3/In2S3 resulted in a photocurrent of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 when exposed to light irradiation. This strategy has practical significance for developing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance PEC sensors.







Abstract
In the past several decades, Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing still remains a great challenge to design highly&#8208;efficient semiconductor photocatalysts via a facile method. It is of much importance to design and synthesize various novel nanostructured sensing materials for further improving the response performance. Herein, we present an In2O3/In2S3 heterostructure obtained by combining microwave assisted hydrothermal method with S&#8208;induced phase change, whose energy band and electronic structure could be adjusted by changing the S content. Combining theoretical calculation and spectroscopic techniques, the introduction of sulfur was proved to produce multifunctional interfaces, inducing the change of phase, oxygen vacancies and band gap, which accelerates the separation of photoexcited carriers and reduces their recombination, improving the electronic injection efficiency around the interface of In2O3/In2S3. As anticipated, an enhanced glucose response performance with a photocurrent of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mM and a detection limit as low as 14.5&#8197;&#956;M has been achieved based on the In2O3/In2S3 heterostructure, which is significant superior over its pure In2O3 and S&#8208;doped In2O3 counterparts. This efficient interfacial strategy may open a new route to manipulate the electrical structure, and energy band structure regulation of sensing material to improve the performance of photoelectrodes for PEC.

         <title>Hydroamination of Triisopropylsilyl Acetylene Sulfur Pentafluoride &#8208; a Bench&#8208;top Route to Pentafluorosulfanylated Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic access to a variety of aliphatic and vinylic pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks remains a major challenge in contemporary organofluorine chemistry hampering its investigation in the context of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and functional materials. Herein, we report a bench&#8208;top protocol to access the virtually unknown class of &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;enamines under mild reaction conditions in good to excellent yields (up to 95%). This reaction combines the protodesilylation of the commercially available precursor TASP with the in&#8208;situ hydroamination of HC&#8801;C&#8208;SF5. The on&#8208;site use of highly toxic gases or corrosive reagents is avoided, making access to this motif applicable to a wide chemical audience. The excellent E&#8208;diastereoselectivity of this two&#8208;step cascade reaction is suggested to be the result of the convergence of the fast Z&#8208;/E&#8208; isomerization of a vinyl anion as well as the isomerization of the iminium ion. The remarkable thermal stability of these SF5&#8208;enamines encourages further studies of their synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles&#160;via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Morphology Evolution and Function Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystalline&#160;nanoparticles (LC NPs) are a kind&#160;of polymer&#160;NPs&#160;with LC mesogens, which can form special anisotropic morphologies due to the influence of LC ordering.&#160;Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the LC blocks,&#160;LC NPs show abundant&#160;morphology&#160;evolution behaviors in response to external regulation. LC NPs have&#160;great application&#160;potential in nano&#8208;devices, drug delivery, special fibers and other fields. Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) method can synthesize LC NPs at&#160;high solid content, reducing&#160;the harsh demand for reaction solvent of the LC monomers,&#160;being a better&#160;choice for large&#8208;scale production. In this review, we introduced&#160;recent research progress of PISA&#8208;LC NPs by dividing them into several parts according to the&#160;LC mesogen, and discussed&#160;the improvement of experimental conditions and the potential application of these&#160;polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization by Consecutive Paired Electrolysis: Dibromination of Aryl Amines with Dibromoethane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a facile and efficient electrochemical method for the dibromination of aryl amines by double functionalization of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H (both para and ortho) under metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions at room temperature for the first time. The reaction is demonstrated using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to dibrominate a wide range of N&#8208;substituted aryl amines in a simple setup with C(+)/Pt(&#8722;) electrodes under mild reaction conditions. This transformation proceeds smoothly with a broad substrate scope affording the valuable and versatile N&#8208;substituted 2,4dibromoanilines in moderate to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. In this convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The versatility of the electrochemical ortho&#8208;, paradibromination was reflected by unique regioselectivities for challenging aryl amines and gram&#8208;scale electrosynthesis without the use of a stoichiometric oxidant or an activating agent.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organoselenium compounds have shown an important role as intermediates in many areas, such as drug discovery, organic catalysis, and nanomaterials.

         <title>Photophysical Analysis of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Luminogens Based on Triphenylamine and Thiophene: Insights into Emission Behavior in Solution and PMMA Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5'&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via Locally Excited (LE) or Planar Intramolecular Charge Transfer (PICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The implacable rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere and acute water stress are one of the central challenges of our time. Present&#8208;day chemistry is strongly inclined towards more sustainable solutions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), attributable to their structural designability with atomic precision, functionalizable chemical environment and robust extended architectures, have demonstrated promising performances in CO2 trapping and water harvesting from air. In this Review, we discuss the major developments in this field as well as sketch out the opportunities and shortcomings that remain over large&#8208;scale COF synthesis, device engineering, and long&#8208;term performance in real environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Vicinal Intermolecular Annulations of Iodoarenes, Indoles, and Carbazoles with Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodobenzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with 1,6&#8208;enynes is described. The relay involved 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which were readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which a challenging benzylic monooxygenation was showcased.







Abstract
Reaching the formidable C&#8722;H corners has been one of the top priorities of organic chemists in the recent past. This prompted us to disclose herein a vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodo benzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with N&#8208;embedded 1,6&#8208;enynes through 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles. The relay does not require the assistance of any directing group, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which are readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which we showcase a rare benzylic mono&#8208;oxygenation.

         <title>Revealing the Unique Role of Water in the Formation of Benzothiazoles: an Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of benzothiazoles catalyzed by water is studied using both experimental and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods. Free energy calculations from DFT&#8208;metadynamics suggest water as the sole catalyst at room temperature. The influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on the chemical reactivity is discussed.







Abstract
We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthuss mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80&#8197;kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250&#8197;kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Pyranthiones/Pyrones: &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Donors for Subcellular Hydrogen Sulfide Delivery and Labeling

Click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN), features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs) for tunable H2S delivery and imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the most important gasotransmitters, plays a critical role in endogenous signaling pathways of many diseases. However, developing H2S donors with both tunable release kinetics and high release efficiency for subcellular delivery has been challenging. Here, we describe a click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN). This reaction features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs). Interestingly, pyranthiones showed enhanced reaction rates compared to their pyrone counterparts. We investigated pyrone biorthogonality and demonstrated their utility in protein labeling applications. Moreover, we synthesized substituted pyranthiones with H2S release kinetics that can address the range of physiologically relevant H2S dynamics in cells and achieved quantitative H2S release efficiency in&#8197;vitro. Finally, we explored the potential of pyranthiones as H2S/COS donors for mitochondrial&#8208;targeted H2S delivery in living cells.

         <title>Polar covalent apex&#8208;base bonding in borapyramidanes probed by solid&#8208;state NMR and DFT calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyramidane molecules have attracted chemists for many decades due to their regular shape, high symmetry and their correspondence in the macroscopic world. Recently, experimental access to a number of examples has been reported, in particular the rarely reported square pyramidal bora[4]pyramidanes. To describe the bonding situation of the nonclassical structure of pyramidanes, we present solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a versatile tool for deciphering such bonding properties for three now accessible bora[4]pyramidane and dibora[5]pyramidane molecules. 11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectra indicate that the apical boron nuclei in these compounds are strongly shielded (around &#8208;50 ppm vs. BF3&#8208;Et2O complex) and possess quadrupolar coupling constants of less than 0.9 MHz pointing to a rather high local symmetry. 13C&#8208;11B spin&#8208;spin coupling constants have been explored as a measure of the bond covalency in the borapyramidanes. While the carbon&#8208;boron bond to the &#8211;B(C6F5)2 substituents of the base serves as an example for a classical covalent 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;sp2&#8208;boron &#963;&#8208;bond with 1J(13C&#8208;11B) coupling constants in the order of 75 Hz, those of the boron(apical)&#8208;carbon(basal) bonds in the pyramid are too small to measure. These results suggest that these bonds have a strongly ionic character, which is also supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.</dc:description>

To describe the bonding situation of the nonclassical structure of pyramidanes, we present solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a versatile tool for deciphering such bonding properties for three now accessible bora[4]pyramidane and dibora[5]pyramidane molecules. 11B solid-state NMR spectra indicate that the apical boron nuclei in these compounds are strongly shielded (around -50 ppm vs. BF3-Et2O complex) and possess quadrupolar coupling constants of less than 0.9 MHz pointing to a rather high local symmetry. 13C-11B spin-spin coupling constants have been explored as a measure of the bond covalency in the borapyramidanes. While the carbon-boron bond to the &#8211;B(C6F5)2 substituents of the base serves as an example for a classical covalent 2-center-2-electron (2c-2e) sp2-carbon-sp2-boron &#963;-bond with 1J(13C-11B) coupling constants in the order of 75 Hz, those of the boron(apical)-carbon(basal) bonds in the pyramid are too small to measure.

         <title>Unlocking same&#8208;sign CPL: solvent effects on spectral form and racemisation kinetics in nine&#8208;coordinate chiral europium(III) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the factors that shape the circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) emission profiles of europium(III)&#8208;based CPL emitters to have specific sign properties, e.g. monosignate individual CPL transitions, is key to design novel complexes for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging. In order to correlate structure and spectral characteristics, a photophysical and kinetic investigation has been conducted on a series of coordinatively saturated nine&#8208;coordinate europium(III) systems based on 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane. 
We highlight that lanthanide emission is sensitive to changes in the ligand field by showing the linear dependence of total emission intensity ratios as a function of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying an internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state. This sensitivity increases by a factor of 20 when studying changes in CPL spectra, rendering these complexes accurate probes of local polarity. Solvent polarity, solvent&#8208;specific effects, and the nature of the chromophores&#8217; coordinating donor atoms strongly influence the kinetic stability of europium(III) complexes with respect to enantiomer interconversion. Notably, we show that the choice of donor groups to coordinating to europium(III) and the nature and polarity of the solvent affects the rate of racemisation, leading to very long half&#8208;lives at room temperature in non&#8208;polar media.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling pH&#8208;Sensitive Chemical Reactions Pathways with Light &#8208; a Tale of Two Photobases: an Arrhenius and a Br&#248;nsted</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;gated chemical reactions allow spatial and temporal control of chemical processes. Here, we suggest a new system for controlling pH&#8208;sensitive processes with light using two photobases of Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted types. Only after light excitation do Arrhenius photobases undergo hydroxide ion dissociation, while Br&#248;nsted photobases capture a proton. However, none can be used alone to reversibly control pH due to the limitations arising from excessively fast or overly slow photoreaction timescales. We show here that combining the two types of photobases allows light&#8208;triggered and reversible pH control. We show an application of this method in directing the pH&#8208;dependent reaction pathways of the organic dye Alizarin Red S simply by switching between different wavelengths of light, i.e., irradiating each photobase separately. The concept of a light&#8208;controlled system shown here of a sophisticated interplay between two photobases can be integrated into various smart functional and dynamic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of Activated Carboxylic Acids (ACAs) allows the time&#8208;controlled operation of dissipative chemical systems based on the acid&#8208;base reaction by providing both the stimulus that temporarily drives a physicochemical change and, subsequently, the counter&#8208;stimulus with a single reagent addition. However, their application is inherently limited to acid&#8208;sensitive systems. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop a straightforward device for the transduction of the acid&#8208;base stimuli delivered by an ACA into a voltage signal that, in turn, is used to control voltage&#8209;sensitive circuits that are not pH&#8209;responsive by themselves. The signal transductor can be easily assembled from common laboratory equipment and employs aqueous solutions of readily available chemicals. Furthermore, the operator can simply and intuitively tune the amplitude of the voltage signal, as well as its duration and offset by varying the concentration of the chemical species involved in the transduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8208;C to C&#8208;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#183;&#183;&#183;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this concept, we showcase the upsurge in the studies of dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials containing inorganic and/or organic components as versatile photo&#8208;responsive platforms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of photo&#8208;controllable RTP, and meanwhile delve into the underlying RTP properties of various classes of photochromic materials including metal&#8211;organic complexes, organic&#8208;inorganic co&#8208;crystals, purely organic small molecules and organic polymers. In particular, the design principles governing the integration of the photochromic and RTP moieties within a single material system, and the tuning of dynamic RTP in response to light are emphasized. As such, this concept sheds light on the challenges and opportunities of using these tunable RTP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics, particularly highlighting their use of reversible information encryption, erasable light printing and rewritable smart paper.</dc:description>

         <title>Ca(II) and Yb(II) complexes featuring M(C&#8801;C)4 structural motif: enforced proximity or genuine &#951;2&#8208;bonding?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis(carbazolide) complexes M[3,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;1,8&#8208;(RC&#8801;C)2Carb]2(THF)n (R = SiMe3, n = 0, M = Ca, Yb; R = Ph, n = 1, M = Ca, Yb; n = 0, M = Yb) were synthesized through transamination reaction of M[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 with two molar equivalents of carbazoles. The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution.

The complexes feature M(&#951;2-C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline- and rare-earth metals &#951;2-interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond.

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;O, C&#8208;S, and C&#8208;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiolabelled&#160;177Lu&#8208;Bispidine&#8208;Trastuzumab for Targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Cancers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radioimmunotherapy (TRIT) is a promising alternative to conventional treatment options. Here,&#160;we present experimental work on the synthesis, radiochemistry, and&#160;in vivo&#160;performance of a lanthanide&#8208;selective nonadentate bispidine ligand suitable for&#160;177Lu3+&#160;ion complexation. The ligand (bisp,1) was derivatised with a photoactivatable aryl azide (ArN3) group as a bioconjugation handle for light&#8208;induced labelling of proteins. Quantitative radiosynthesis of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;was accomplished in 10 minutes at 40oC. Subsequent incubation [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;with trastuzumab, followed by irradiation with light at 365 nm for 15 min, at room temperature and pH8.0&#8211;8.3, gave the radiolabelled mAb, [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;azepin&#8208;trastuzumab ([177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb) in a decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of 14%, and radiochemical purity (RCP)&gt;90%. Stability studies and cellular binding assays&#160;in vitro&#160;using the SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 human ovarian cancer cells confirmed that [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb remained biological active and displayed specific binding to HER2/neu. Experiments in immunocompromised female athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft models of SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 tumours revealed significantly higher tumour uptake in the normal group compared with the control block group (29.8&#177;11.4%ID g&#8208;1&#160;vs. 14.8&#177;6.1%ID g&#8208;1, respectively;&#160;P&#8208;value=0.037). The data indicate that bispidine&#8208;based ligand systems are suitable starting points for constructing novel, high&#8208;denticity chelators for specific complexation of larger radiotheranostic metal ion nuclides.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Novel Redox&#8208;Active Organic Materials Based on Benzimidazole, Benzoxazole, and Benzothiazole: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining theory and experiment allows the screening of new active materials. Electrochemical properties of the redox moieties can be predicted accurately. Out of three classes of molecule (benzo&#8208;thiazole, &#8208;oxazole, &#8208;imidazole), benzoxazoles exhibit the best electrochemical properties and can be further introduced into or onto a polymeric backbone, with the aim of being used in organic polymer batteries.







Abstract
Sustainability is one of the hot topics of today's research, in particular when it comes to energy&#8208;storage systems such as batteries. Redox&#8208;active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which partially rely on non&#8208;sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, &#8208;oxazole and &#8208;imidazole derivatives as redox&#8208;active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target molecules were identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical characterization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and used in organic polymer batteries.

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work azotriptycenes are presented as light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. Their mechanism of motion and changed kinetics upon isomerization are studied by theory and variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8722;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8722;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.

Reversible &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent material: The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive due to the ordered and long&#8208;range &#960; stacking. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed owing to the formation of pyrene dimer structure. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material.







Abstract
It is always a challenge to achieve &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; luminescent switch by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions. Herein, we report a unique strategy for constructing high performance &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; tunable luminescent materials utilizing a novel molecule (TFPA) consist of pyrene and cyanostilbene. The pristine crystal of TFPA is almost non&#8208;emissive. Upon grinding/UV irradiation, an obvious luminescence enhancement is observed. Theoretical and experimental results revealed the underlying mechanism of this intriguing &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8220; switching behavior. The non&#8208;emissive crystal consists of ordered H&#8208;aggregates, with adjacent two molecules stacked in an anti&#8208;parallel manner and no overlapped area in pyrene moieties. When external force is applied by grinding or internal force is introduced through the photoisomerization, the dimer structures are facilitated with shorter intermolecular distances and better overlapping of pyrene moieties. In addition, the &#8220;on&#8221; state can recover to &#8220;off&#8221; state under thermal annealing, showing good reversibility and applicability in intelligence material. The present results promote an in&#8208;depth insight between packing structure and photophysical property, and offer an effective strategy for the construction of luminescence &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching materials, toward the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Are &#8220;Carbon Dots&#8221; Always Carbon Dots? Evidence for their Supramolecular Nature from Structural and Dynamic Studies in Solution and in the Pure Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model unraveling the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, in which small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species present in dilute solution dynamically assemble into supramolecular organized structures when highly concentrated or in the solid state. (HR&#8208;TEM: high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, PFG&#8208;NMR: pulsed field gradient&#8208;NMR, TRFA: time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy).







Abstract
A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in the solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is proposed herein. Overwhelming evidence has been collected that links the data coming from solid&#8208;state analysis (high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG)&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species when the solvent is removed to give the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. This study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).

         <title>Access to NHC&#8211;Boryl Mono&#8208; and Bis&#8208;Selenide and Utility as Mild Selenium Transfer Reagent including to the C&#8722;F Bond</title>

Access to NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;boryl mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;selenides from NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 has been achieved. The boryl mono selenide has been demonstrated to function as a selenium transfer reagent, enabling the synthesis of selenoethers from benzyl bromide. Additionally, it can also facilitate the conversion of the challenging aromatic C&#8722;F bond to a C&#8722;Se bond, resulting in concomitant ring expansion of NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;haloborane.







Abstract
Reactions of 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 (5&#8208;SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) (1) with diphenyldiselenide provide access to 5&#8208;SIDipp&#8211;boryl mono&#8208; (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2SePh) (2) and bis&#8208;selenide (5&#8208;SIDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH(SePh)2) (3). The facile cleavage of the B&#8722;Se bond makes 2 a neutral source of selenium nucleophiles in substitutions reactions with benzyl bromides, and provide access to the corresponding selenoethers. The direct transformations of one of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bonds of C5F5N and C6F5CF3 to C&#8722;Se bonds have also been achieved by the use of 2 without employing transition&#8208;metal catalysts. While it was previously established that C6F6 could undergo complete defluoroselenation under harsh conditions, we successfully achieved partial defluorination of C6F6 by employing 2 as a mild selenide transfer reagent. During the formation of C&#8722;Se bonds through the cleavage of C&#8722;F bonds, the potential by&#8208;product NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2F undergoes ring expansion of the NHC, leading to the formation of the six&#8208;membered diaazafluoroborinane (7).

         <title>Cyclic Azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic hybrids of azobenzene and BODIPY 2B&#8211;8B were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction and following BF2 insertion. The structures of the representative hybrids were unambiguously revealed by single crystal diffraction analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation, and ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays depend upon the ring size and connectivity.







Abstract
Cyclic azobenzene&#8208;BODIPY hybrids were synthesized via cyclization by 1) acid&#8208;catalysed condensation of azobenzene&#8208;bridged dipyrroles with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzaldehyde, 2) oxidation with DDQ, and 3) metalation with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O. The structures of many cyclic hybrids have been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The absorption spectra of the hybrids reveal the effective cyclic conjugation. The ultrafast measurements reveal that the photoexcited decays of these cyclic hybrids depend upon the ring size and connectivity.

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Heteronuclear Fe&#8722;Mo Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) denoted as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) immobilized within the pores of g&#8208;C3N4 was designed by density functional theory computations, aiming to explore the nitrogen fixation activity of the Fe&#8722;Mo center and the influence of the coordination environment.







Abstract
Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8722;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6&#8722;aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g&#8208;C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6&#8722;aXa DACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of &#8722;0.11&#8197;V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1&#8242;s high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments.

         <title>Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8722;H Sulfonylation and Thiocyanation of Fused Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;Ones in an All&#8208;Green Electrolytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical oxidative method for forming C&#8722;S bonds at the C3 position in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones using sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate has been developed. This method does not require any of the additional reagents or hazardous solvents, such as supporting electrolytes, HFIP, additives, or catalysts.







Abstract
An electrooxidative C&#8722;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non&#8208;recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and an electrolyte&#8208;free process has yet to be developed. This work demonstrates that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all&#8208;green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8722;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be selectively converted into C3&#8208;sulfonylated and &#8208;thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Understanding the Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals Formation Process: The Conversion from Heptazine to Triazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium chloride is a decisive factor in converting heptazine&#8208;based Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 into triazine&#8208;based PTI, thereby leads to a drastic change in physicochemical properties and achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) (PTI) generally obtained via ionothermal synthesis features extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhanced crystallinity. However, in&#8208;depth investigation of the polycondensation process for PTI is an onerous task due to multiple influencing factors and limited characterization techniques. Herein, to simplify the polymerization route and exclude non&#8208;essential factors, PTI was prepared by calcining only melamine and LiCl. This study aims to identify the pivotal role of LiCl in PTI formation, which can convert heptazine&#8208;based intermediates into more stable triazine&#8208;based PTI framework. Based on this discovery, we demonstrate the transformation process of the prepared samples from amorphous Bulk g&#8208;C3N4 to regular PTI, and further prove that the reaction with LiCl causes disruption of heptazine covalent organic frameworks. Additionally, the PTI exhibits higher photocatalytic water splitting performance due to efficient charge carrier mobility and separation, as well as faster reaction kinetics. This discovery deepens understanding of the polycondensation process of PTI crystals and provides insights toward the rational design of crystalline carbon nitride&#8208;based semiconductors.

         <title>The impact of stoichiometry on the initial steps of crystal formation: Stability and lifetime of charged triple&#8208;ion complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minerals form in nature from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion&#8208;ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically, Ba(SO4)22&#8208; had higher association constants and its lifetime was twofold longer than Ba2SO42+. Similar trends were observed for BaCO3 and CaSO4. Contrastingly, for CaCO3, Ca(CO3)22&#8208; had lower association constants and its lifetime was shorter than Ca2CO32+. These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Air&#8208;Stable [3]Radialene Anion Radicals as Environmentally Switchable Catholytes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ester&#8208;substituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize in solutions of water. The dimerization mode is structure specific and can be controlled by using heat, solvent, and salt. These results provide guidance for increasing the capacity of aqueous redox flow batteries containing radialene catholytes. A buildup of &#963;&#8208;dimer prevents stable charge&#8211;discharge cycling. The formation of &#960;&#8208;dimers through the addition of salt increases the stability of the charged species.







Abstract
The hexacyano[3]radialene radical anion (1) is an attractive catholyte material for use in redox flow battery (RFB) applications. The substitution of cyano groups with ester moieties enhances solubility while maintaining redox reversibility and favorable redox potentials. Here we show that these ester&#8208;functionalized, hexasubstituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in water. The dimerization mode is dependent on the substitution pattern and can be switched in solution. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved by exploiting an unprecedented tristate switching mechanism, wherein the radical can be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a &#963;&#8208;dimer&#8208;each with dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties&#8208;by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity. The symmetric, triester&#8208;tricyano[3]radialene (3) forms a solvent&#8208;responsive, &#963;&#8208;dimer in water that converts to the radical anion with the addition of organic solvents or to a &#960;&#8208;dimer in brine solutions. Diester&#8208;tetracyano[3]radialene (2) exists primarily as a &#960;&#8208;dimer in aqueous solutions and a radical anion in organic solvents. The dimerization behavior of both 2 and 3 is temperature dependent in methanol solutions. Dimerization equilibrium has a direct impact on catholyte stability during galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling in static H&#8208;cells. Specifically, conditions that favor the free radical anion or &#960;&#8208;dimer exhibit significantly enhanced cycling profiles.

         <title>10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Level TiNb2O7 Secondary Particles for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Fast charging: 10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;level TiNb2O7 secondary particle consisting of initial 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;m TiNb2O7 active particle with high crystallinity was successfully fabricated. The small number of particle&#8208;stacking layers with high conductivity could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance within the electrode, which enabled the outstanding fast&#8208;charging performance of 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level full cells.







Abstract
TiNb2O7 with Wadsley&#8211;Roth phase delivers double theoretical specific capacity and similar working potential in comparison to spinel Li4Ti5O12, the commercial high&#8208;rate anode material, and thus can enable much higher energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the inter&#8208;particle resistance within the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading TiNb2O7 electrode would impede the capacity release for practical application, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Herein, 10&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;size carbon&#8208;coated TiNb2O7 secondary particle (SP&#8208;TiNb2O7) consisting of initial micro&#8208;scale TiNb2O7 particles (MP&#8208;TiNb2O7) was fabricated. The high crystallinity of active material could enable fast&#8208;charge diffusion and electrochemical reaction rate within particles, and the small number of stacking layers of SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance that regular particle electrode often possess and achieve high compaction density of electrodes with high mass loading. The investigation on materials structure and electrochemical reaction kinetics verified the advances of the as&#8208;fabricated SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 in achieving superior electrochemical performance. The SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 exhibited high reversible capacity of 292.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the potential range of 1&#8211;3&#8197;V (Li+/Li) at 0.1&#8197;C, delivering high&#8208;capacity release of 94.3&#8201;%, and high capacity retention of 86&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C for 250&#8197;cycles in half cell configuration. Particularly, the advances of such an anode were verified in practical 5&#8197;Ah&#8208;level laminated full pouch cell. The as&#8208;assembled LiFePO4||TiNb2O7 full cell exhibited a high capacity of 5.08&#8197;Ah at high charging rate of 6&#8197;C (77.9&#8201;% of that at 0.2&#8197;C of 6.52&#8197;Ah), as well as an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0352&#8201;% for 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C, suggesting the great potential for practical fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cyclometalatedgold(III)&#8208;hydride under oriented external electric fields: a new strategy to modulate its reactivity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selected gold complexes have been regarded as promising anti&#8208;cancer agents because they can bind with protein targets containing thiol or selenol moieties, but their clinical applications were hindered by the unbiased binding towards off&#8208;target thiol&#8208;proteins. Recently, a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex (abbreviated as 1) with visible light&#8208;induced thiol reactivity has been reported as potent photo&#8208;activated anticancer agents (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 132, 11139). To explore new strategies to stimuli this potential antitumor drug, the effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on its geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity was systematically investigated. Results reveal that imposing external electric fields along the Au&#8208;H bond of 1 can effectively activate this bond, which is conducive to its dissociation and the binding of Au site to potential targets. Hence, this study provides a new OEEF&#8208;strategy to activate this reported gold(III)&#8208;hydride, revealing its potential application in electrochemical therapy. We anticipate this work could promote the development of more electric field&#8208;activated anticancer agents. However, further experimental research should be conducted to verify the conclusions obtained in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biphenyl&#8208;Bridged &#1013;&#8208;Sultams by Organocatalytic Mannich Reactions of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylimines with Unactivated Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
Biphenyl&#8208;bridged &#1013;&#8208;sultams with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were synthesized through organocatalytic Mannich reactions of seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with unactivated methyl alkyl ketones. Unactivated ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates will gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective Mannich reaction of biphenyl&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with methyl alkyl ketones is disclosed in this study. The reaction was performed under organocatalysis by using a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine as the catalyst in combination with a Br&#248;nsted acid as the co&#8208;catalyst. High yields (up to 89&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were observed. For methyl alkyl ketones containing a larger alkyl substituent, specific regioselective addition to the C=N bond is favored at the methyl group. On the contrary, ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Starbons&#174;: Methodology Development and Carbon Dioxide Capture Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen doping: Glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide are used as sustainable nitrogen sources in the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174;. Doping using microwave heating more effectively incorporates nitrogen than thermal heating in vacuo. The nitrogen&#8208;doped materials have superior carbon dioxide adsorption capacities and enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen selectivities compared to undoped Starbon&#174;.







Abstract
Five nitrogen sources (glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide) and three heating methods (thermal, monomodal microwave and multimodal microwave) are used to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; derived from starch. The materials are initially produced at 250&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C (SNx300y), then heated in vacuo to 800&#8201;&#176;C to produce nitrogen&#8208;doped SNx800y&#8217;s. Melamine gives the highest nitrogen incorporation without destroying the Starbon&#174; pore structure and the microwave heating methods give higher nitrogen incorporations than thermal heating. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; determined gravimetrically, in many cases exceed those of S300 and S800. The carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane adsorption isotherms of the most promising materials are measured volumetrically. Most of the nitrogen&#8208;doped materials show higher carbon dioxide adsorption capacities than S800, but lower methane and nitrogen adsorption capacities. As a result, the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; exhibit significantly enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen and methane versus nitrogen selectivities compared to S800.

         <title>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes: Strategies for Syntheses of Configurationally Stable, Electronically and Sterically Tunable Ambiphiles with Multiple Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic strategies to the rigid, multiple reactive, tunable and versatile applicable title compounds are reviewed, including various o&#8208;metalation procedures followed by direct P&#8722;C coupling or phospho&#8208;Fries rearrangements, UV&#8208; or transition&#8208;metal mediated couplings, addition reactions of PH&#8208;reactants at quinones or intermediate arynes, and thermal or photo&#8208;induced decomposition of &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketophosphonates.







Abstract
o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes are fascinating compounds by their multiple&#8208;reactivity features, attributed to the ambident hard and soft Lewis&#8208; and also Br&#248;nstedt acid&#8208;base properties, wide tuning opportunities via backbone substituents with &#177;mesomeric and inductive, at P and in o&#8208;position to P and O also steric effects, and in addition, the configurational stability at three&#8208;valent phosphorus. Air sensitivity may be overcome by reversible protection with BH3, but the easy oxidation to P(V)&#8208;compounds may also be used. Since the first reports on the title compounds ca. 50&#8197;years ago the multiple reactivity has led to versatile applications. This includes various P&#8722;E&#8722;O and P=C&#8722;O heterocycles, a multitude of O&#8208;substituted derivatives including acyl derivatives for traceless Staudinger couplings of biomolecules with labels or functional substituents, phosphane&#8208;phosphite ligands, which like the o&#8208;phosphanylphenols itself form a range of transition metal complexes and catalysts. Also main group metal complexes and (bi)arylphosphonium&#8208;organocatalysts are derived. Within this review the various strategies for the access of the starting materials are illuminated, including few hints to selected applications.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Highly Crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333) was synthesized through a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis. With this crystalline product, it was possible for the first time to elucidate the crystal structure of LiMoS2 by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The arrangement of Mo atoms in the b&#8208;c plane confirms a predicted Peierls distortion.







Abstract
LixMoS2 is not only a lithium battery material, but is also an important precursor for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials. Current syntheses of MoS2, such as in n&#8208;butyllithium/LiBH4 or electrochemically, are not satisfying in terms of defined stoichiometry and crystallinity, so an accurate experimental crystal structure determination of this important and widely used material has been long awaited. A high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis yielded highly crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333). 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LiMoS2 crystallizes in the space group P
 with a=6.2482(3)&#8197;&#197;, b=6.6336(3)&#8197;&#197;, c=6.7480(3)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=119.321(2)&#176;, &#946;=90.010(2)&#176; and &#947;=90.077(2)&#176;. The arrangement of Mo atoms within the b&#8208;c&#8208;plane confirmed a predicted Peierls distortion. A similar atom distribution pattern to that of Mo is also observed for the lithium atoms. Calculation of bond valence site energies gave an activation barrier of 1.244&#8197;eV for 2D lithium&#8208;ion migration. For x=1.333, a phase&#8208;pure synthesis was achieved.

         <title>Copper&#8208;mediated N&#8208;Trifluoromethylation of O&#8208;Benzoylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;mediated electrophilic amination methodology has been developed to provide access to a range of structurally diverse N&#8722;CF3 amines in good to moderate yields. The method proceeds under mild reaction conditions utilizing inexpensive reagents in an operationally simple manner.







Abstract
The use of trifluoromethyl containing compounds is well established within medicinal chemistry, with a range of approved drugs containing C&#8722;CF3 and O&#8722;CF3 moieties. However, the utilisation of the N&#8722;CF3 functional group remains relatively unexplored. This may be attributed to the challenging synthesis of this unit, with many current methods employing harsh conditions or less accessible reagents. A robust methodology for the N&#8208;trifluoromethylation of secondary amines has been developed, which employs an umpolung strategy in the form of a copper&#8208;catalysed electrophilic amination. The method is operationally simple, uses mild, inexpensive reagents, and has been used to synthesise a range of novel, structurally complex N&#8722;CF3 containing compounds.

The detection of perchlorate is necessary for monitoring environmental pollution. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302968), E. Keinan, J. Huskens, O. Reany and co&#8208;workers show that self&#8208;assembled monolayers of semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils show excellent sensitivity and selectivity in the electrochemical impedimetric detection of the perchlorate anion in comparison to other anions.

         <title>An Investigation of Allyl&#8208;Substituted Bis(Diphosphine) Iron Complexes: Towards Precursors for Cooperative CO2 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the development of homogenous catalysts capable of selective CO2 reduction, factors that impact CO2 coordination mode and downstream reactivity are of interest. This work presents the synthesis of novel Fe compounds bearing unsaturated diphosphine ligands, their reactivity with CO2, and a theoretical exploration of cooperative CO2 activation using a boron&#8208;rich secondary coordination sphere.







Abstract
In developing homogenous catalysts capable of CO2 activation, interaction with a metal center is often imperative. This work provides primary efforts towards the cooperative activation of CO2 using a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and iron via a paired theoretical/experimental approach. Specifically, this study reports efforts towards [Fe(diphosphine)2(N2)] as a CO2&#8208;coordinated synthon where diphosphine=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;cyclohexylboranyl)propylphosphino)ethane) (P2BCy4) or its precursor, 1,2&#8208;bis(diallylphosphino)ethane (tape). Initial efforts toward the {Fe(0)&#8208;N2} complex were focused on deprotonation reactions of [Fe(diphosphine)2(H)(NCCH3)]+ and reduction of [Fe(tape)2Cl2]. In the latter case, a mixture of intramolecularly &#960;&#8208;bonded alkene and associated metallacyclic Fe(II)&#8212;H species were produced &#8211; heating this mixture provided the hydride as the major product. Notably, the interconversion of this pair counters that of related intermolecular reactions between [Fe(depe)2] (depe=1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) and ethylene, where hydride formation occurs subsequent to &#960;&#8208;coordination; this has been probed by theoretical calculations. Finally, reactivity of the metallacyclic {Fe(II)&#8212;H} complex with CO2 was probed, resulting in a pair of isomeric ferra(II)lactones.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Mn(II)&#8208;complex Catalyzed Switchable De(hydrogenative) Csp3&#8208;H Functionalization of Methyl Heteroarenes: A Sustainable Approach for Diversification of Heterocyclic Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of methyl heteroarenes employing one single air, moisture stable and cost effective Mn(II) bridge complex has been demonstrated. Seven different types of heteroarenes are functionalized using various aromatic and aliphatic primary alcohols with good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Catalytic activities of Mn(I) complexes derived from expensive MnBr(CO)5 salt have been explored in various dehydrogenative transformations. However, the reactivity and selectivity of inexpensive high spin Mn(II) complexes are uncommon. Herein, we have synthesized four new Mn(II) complexes and explored switchable alkenylation and alkylation of methyl heteroarenes employing a single Mn(II)catalyst. The developed protocol selectively furnishes a series of functionalized E&#8208;heteroarenes and C&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes with good to excellent yields. Various medicinally and synthetically useful compounds are successfully synthesized using our developed protocol. Various controls and kinetics experiments were executed to shed light on the mechaism,which reveals that &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond breaking of alcohol is the slowest step.

         <title>Understanding the Electronic Structure of Magnetic Trinuclear Complexes Based on the Tris&#8208;dioxolene Triphenylene Non&#8208;innocent Bridging Ligand, a Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic properties of trinuclear complexes based on the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8722; is independent from both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions, when it is in the full semiquinone state. They are governed only by the electronic structure of HHTP3&#8722; that can be qualitatively inferred from the analysis of the X&#8208;ray structure of the related complexes.







Abstract
A complete theoretical analysis using first the simple H&#252;ckel model followed by more sophisticated multi&#8208;reference calculations on a trinuclear Ni(II) complex (Tp#Ni3HHTP), bearing the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8722;, is carried out. The three semiquinone moieties of HHTP3&#8722; couple antiferromagnetically and lead to a single unpaired electron localized on one of the moieties. The calculated exchange coupling integrals together with the zero&#8208;field parameters allow, when varied within a certain range, reproducing the experimental data. These results are generalized for two similar other trinuclear complexes containing Ni(II) and Cu(II). The electronic structure of HHTP3&#8722; turns out to be independent of both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions. We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non&#8208;innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X&#8208;ray structure.

Mimicking nature's efficient nanomotors: The ability to perform mechanical work far away from the rotation axes of light&#8208;driven molecular motors is a key component of future synthetic molecular machinery. The center of the cover image shows a molecular photogear with this ability, with the spiralling arrow indicating the direction of a full photogearing cycle. In the background, the gearing process is represented by cogwheels. More information can be found in the Research Article by E.&#8197;M. Arpa, S.

         <title>Diversification of Simple Arenes into Complex (Amino)cyclitols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic approach for accessing complex natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes. A key feature includes the application of a dearomative functionalization with arenophiles and subsequent diversification, generating a widespread library of compounds spanning far into underexplored chemical space.







Abstract
Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. This work reports the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations. Practical guidelines were developed for the synthesis of natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes through a series of strategic functionalization events.

         <title>Reductive Metallation of Dendralenes and Myrcene using Dimagnesium(I) Compounds: A Facile Route to Unsaturated Organomagnesium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing dendralenes: The reduction of [4]dendralene and related substituted butadienes with dimagnesium(I) compounds has given a series of unsaturated organo&#8208;magnesium complexes (see picture, L=bulky N,N&#8208;chelating amide). Reaction of two of these with H2 and/or CO leads to the assembly of the substrates, affording value&#8208;added organic products.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron reduction of 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (DMB) with &#946;&#8208;diketiminate and guanidinate substituted dimagnesium(I) compounds has given complexes in which two bidentate amido&#8208;magnesium fragments are bridged through the &#960;&#8208;system of the DMB dianion, viz. [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] (L=XylNacnac, [HC(MeCNXyl)2]&#8722;, Xyl=2,6&#8208;xylyl; or Priso=[(DipN)2CNPri2]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Similar double reductions of [4]dendralene (4dend) have afforded the complexes, [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (L=ArNacnac, Ar=Xyl or mesityl (Mes); or Priso) in which the 4dend dianion is &#960;&#8208;coordinated to the bidentate amido&#8208;magnesium fragments. Treatment of several such complexes with THF leads to Z&#8208; to E&#8208;isomerization of the dendralene fragment, and formation of purely &#963;&#8208;bonded Mg&#8722;C interactions in the THF coordinated products [{(ArNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;4dend)] (Ar=Xyl, Mes or Dip). Reaction of myrcene (Myr) with [{(XylNacnac)Mg}2] proceeds via reductive coupling of Myr to give a previously unknown acyclic, branched C20 tetra&#8208;olefin dianion complex [{(XylNacnac)(THF)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;Myr)2]. Preliminary reactions of [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;DMB)] with H2 and/or CO yielded a series of products, including novel magnesium hydride compounds, products derived from couplings of CO with the reduced DMB fragment (viz. magnesium dimethylcyclohexadienediolates), and one magnesium cyclopropanetriolate complex from the magnesium(I) induced coupling of DMB with H2 and CO.

         <title>Rebound or Cage Escape? The Role of the Rebound Barrier for the Reactivity of Non&#8208;Heme High&#8208;Valent FeIV=O species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of ligand design to modulate rebound barriers in order to achieve efficient and selective hydroxylation reactions with high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species is revealed.







Abstract
Owing to their high reactivity and selectivity, variations in the spin ground state and a range of possible pathways, high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species are popular models with potential bioinspired applications. An interesting example of a structure&#8211;reactivity pattern is the detailed study with five nonheme amine&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand FeIV=O species, including N4py: [(L1)FeIV=O]2+ (1), bntpen: [(L2)FeIV=O]2+ (2), py2tacn: [(L3)FeIV=O]2+ (3), and two isomeric bispidine derivatives: [(L4)FeIV=O]2+ (4) and [(L5)FeIV=O]2+ (5). In this set, the order of increasing reactivity in the hydroxylation of cyclohexane differs from that with cyclohexadiene as substrate. A comprehensive DFT, ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) study is presented to untangle the observed patterns. These are well reproduced when both activation barriers for the C&#8722;H abstraction and the OH rebound are taken into account. An MO, NBO and deformation energy analysis reveals the importance of &#960;(pyr) &#8594; &#960;*xz(FeIII&#8208;OH) electron donation for weakening the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and thus reducing the rebound barrier. This requires that pyridine rings are oriented perpendicularly to the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and this is a subtle but crucial point in ligand design for non&#8208;heme iron alkane hydroxylation.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogs of Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite its great potential for the synthesis of 1&#8208;chiral phosphonates, the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) and deuteration (ATD) of 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates are poorly studied reactions. Like in a pinball machine, one can aim at a variety of different target structures and combine many different pathways in a robust and reliable way. The bonuses to be collected on this synthetic high&#8208;speed line towards 1&#8208;aminophosphonic acids include high enantiomeric excesses, yields and degrees of deuteration. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Pallitsch and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302171).

         <dc:description>Red luminescent materials are essential components for full color display and white lightening based on organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, but the extension of emission color towards red or deep red region generally leads to decreased photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies. Herein, we wish to report two new luminescent molecules (2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA) consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors. As the increase of cyano substituents, the emission wavelength is greatly red&#8208;shifted and the reverse intersystem crossing process is promoted, resulting in strong red delayed fluorescence. Meanwhile, due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the molecular structures become rigidified and planarized, which brings about large horizontal dipole ratios. As a result, 2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA can perform as emitters efficiently in OLEDs, furnishing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8% at 616 nm and 20.4% at 648 nm, which are significantly improved in comparison with that of the control molecule without cyano substituents. The findings in this work demonstrate that the introduction of cyano substituents to the acceptors of delayed fluorescence molecules could be a facile and effective approach to explore high&#8208;efficiency red or deep red delayed fluorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Studies of &#946;&#8208;Azapeptoid Foldamers: A New Class of Peptidomimetics with Confined Dihedrals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids with confined backbone dihedrals were synthesized. These molecules adopted trans amide geometries (&#969; ~180&#176;) with their &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions confined in narrow ranges (170&#8211;180&#176;). Their &#981;(C&#946;&#8208;N) can also be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the &#946;&#8208;carbon, which provide control over their backbone dihedrals.







Abstract
Controlling amide bond geometries and the secondary structures of &#946;&#8208;peptoids is a challenging task as they contain several rotatable single bonds in their backbone. Herein, we describe the synthesis and conformational properties of novel &#8220;&#946;&#8208;azapeptoids&#8221; with confined dihedrals. We discuss how the acylhydrazide sidechains in these molecules enforce trans amide geometries (&#969; ~180&#176;) via steric and stereoelectronic effects. We also show that the &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids occupy a narrow range (170&#8211;180&#176;) that can be rationalized by the staggered conformational preference of the backbone methylene carbons and a novel backbone nO&#8594;&#963;*C&#946;&#8208;N interaction discovered in this study. However, the &#981; (C&#946;&#8208;N) torsion remains freely rotatable and, depending on &#981;, the sidechains can be parallel, perpendicular, and anti&#8208;parallel relative to each other. In fact, we observed parallel and perpendicular relative orientations of sidechains in the crystal geometries of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoid dimers. We show that &#981; of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids can be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the backbone &#946;&#8208;carbon, which could provide complete control over all the backbone dihedrals. Finally, we show that the &#981; and &#936; dihedrals of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids resemble that of a PPII helix and they retain PPII structure when incorporated in Host&#8211;guest proline peptides.

&lt;p&gt;Novel &#946;-azapeptoids with confined backbone dihedrals were synthesized. These molecules adopted trans amide geometries (&#969; ~180&#176;) with their &#920;(C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt;) and &#936;(OC-C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;) backbone torsions confined in narrow ranges (170&#8211;180&#176;). Their &#981;(C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt;-N) can also be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the &#946;-carbon, which provide control over their backbone dihedrals.

         <title>[3+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates and in&#160;situ Generated&#160;Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable [3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in situ generated unstabilized azomethine ylide is reported for the first time. The selective formation of either 1:1 or 1:2 cycloaddition products was achieved by carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, mainly by controlling the reactant stoichiometry, catalyst loading, and internal temperature. The developed protocol tolerated many valuable functional groups, including TMS, protected alcohol (as ether or THP derivatives), or aldehyde (as acetal). Further common C&#8211;C and C &#8211; heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, as well as scaled&#8208;up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting the Antifungal Activity of Carbon Dots against Candida albicans&#160;Biofilm Formation by Tailoring Their Surface Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging class of carbon nanoparticles, which for their characteristics have found applications in many fields such as catalysis, materials and biomedicine. Within this context, the application of CDs as antibacterial agents has received much attention in very recent years, while their use as antifungal nanoparticles has been scarcely investigated. Here we report a systematic investigation of the surface functional groups of CDs to study their influence on these nanoparticles&#8217; against Candida albicans. Three classes of CDs have been synthesised and fully characterized. A thorough in vitro and in vivo biological screening against C. albicans was performed to test their antifungal, antiadhesion and antibiofilm formation activities. Moreover, the interaction with C. albicans cells was investigated by microscopic analysis. Our results evidence how the presence of a positively polarised surface results crucial for the internalization into COS&#8208;7 cells. Positively charged nanoparticles were also able to inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation, to interact with the cellular membrane of C. albicans, and to increase the survival of G. mellonella infected larvae after the injection with positive nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of CDs and their extremely low toxicity may represent a new strategy to combat infections sustained by C.albicans.</dc:description>

         <title>Scaffold Editing of Cubanes into Homocubanes; Homocuneanes via Cuneanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of cage&#8208;type hydrocarbons through the editing of the highly symmetric molecule cubane can be anticipated as one of the efficient approaches. In this paper, we identify a catalyst that facilitates the efficient scaffold isomerization of cubanes into homocubanes. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;diacyloxymethylcubane results in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. The same catalyst was also applied to the isomerization of acyloxymethylcuneanes, producing homocuneanol esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Alkyl&#8208;Locked Axial Chirality Scaffold by Restriction of Molecular Motions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure&#8208;property relationship studies on a newly&#8208;developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl&#8208;chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10&#8208;4 to 10&#8208;1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)&#8208;4C in solution to (R)&#8208;1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though&#8208;out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high&#8208;performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#183;4H2O (Ir&#8208;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 400 nm) reached 99.5%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8208;SiW.</dc:description>

To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions within a pseudo double&#8208;network system. The pseudo first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris&#8208;modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8208;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non&#8208;covalent interactions between Tris&#8208;LDHs and poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;propanesulfonate) (p&#8208;(AM&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9 wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90 % of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self&#8208;recovery and self&#8208;strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Hydroxyl Adsorption in Ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures for Efficient Alkaline Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple topotactic transformation strategy is presented to construct ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures as a desired platform for tailoring the d band centers and further electrocatalytic performance of catalysts. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterointerface is more active toward alkaline methanol oxidation, which may hold great promise in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge transfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#8197;V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.

         <dc:description>
A direct allylic sulfonylation reaction: Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds.

Abstract
Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism for radical sulfonylation is proposed from the control experiments.

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Furanol&#8208;PAHs via Straightforward Ni&#8208;Catalysed Csp2&#8722;F Functionalization: Mechanistic Insights into the Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization afforded aromatic homologation compounds as valid precursors for nanographene and PAH synthesis through the Scholl reaction. By using low acid/oxidant ratios, an unprecedented furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs are obtained and fully characterized, which sheds light into the intricate mechanism of Scholl reaction. Enantiomeric separation of a racemic curved furanol&#8208;PAH is performed.







Abstract
Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographenes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one&#8208;step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization. The latter are rapidly accessed valid precursors for the Scholl reaction, and screening of experimental conditions allowed us to describe for the first time furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs. Mechanistic insights are obtained by DFT to rationalize the formation of the furanol PAHs under moderately acidic conditions. All PAHs and NGs synthesized show moderate/weak fluorescent properties, and all PAHs crystallized show some degree of curvature and are obtained as racemic mixtures. Enantiomeric separation by chiral HPLC of one furanol&#8208;bearing PAH allowed the study of their chiroptical CD properties.

Herein, we present an efficient enantioselective amination of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones utilizing non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The process is applicable to various functionalized substrates and it is found to be scalable. Mechanistic investigations based on control experimental and DFT studies suggest that the reaction operates via non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of 2&#8208;benzofuranones with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is reported. The process is based on non&#8208;covalent interaction of NHC with substrate, facilitating the formation of a chiral ion&#8208;pair that encompasses enolate and azolium salt. The activated enolate adds to an electrophilic amine source with sufficient facial control to furnish an enantioenriched product having an amine substituted quaternary stereocenter. The process displays a broad substrate scope. A preparative scale synthesis has been achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations based on experimental and DFT studies suggest a reaction pathway that involves non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions and essentially implicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in diastereomeric transition states for stereo&#8208;chemical discrimination.

         <title>Cu(II) promoted C(sp3)&#8208;H activation in unactivated cycloalkanes: Oxo&#8208;alkylation of styrenes to synthesize &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones</title>

         <dc:description>We report the Cu(II) catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from styrene via oxo&#8208;alkylation with unactivated cycloalkanes as the alkylating agent in presence of tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and 1&#8208;methylimidazole as oxidant and base respectively. &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones are known to be synthesized by using either expensive Ru/Ir complexes, or low&#8208;cost metal complexes (e.g., Fe, Mn) with activated species like aldehyde, acid, alcohol, or phthalimide derivatives as the alkylating agent, however, use of unactivated cycloalkanes directly as the alkylating agent remains challenging. A wide range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates as well as various olefinic arenes and heteroarene (35 substrates including 14 new substrates) are well&#8208;tolerated in this method. Hammett analysis shed more light on the substitution effect in the olefinic part on the overall mechanism. Furthermore, the controlled experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, and theoretical calculations (DFT) enable us to gain deeper insight of mechanistic intricacies of this new simple and atom&#8208;economic methodology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: N&#8208;Selective carbamoylation reaction of oximes with isocyanates generates nitrones, which undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles to afford diverse isoxazolidines. Notably, combinations of highly electron&#8208;rich oxime and highly electron&#8208;deficient dipolarophile exhibited high reactivity, with product yields of up to 94%. The substituent on the isoxazolidine&#8208;nitrogen atom could be successfully removed without loss of the cyclic structure. Computational studies have also elucidated the mechanism of the reaction and origin of stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethyl group&#160;relishes a privileged position in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into organic molecules often enhances the bioactivity by altering pharmacological profile of molecule. Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls have emerged as pivotal building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry due to their facile accessibility, stability and remarkable versatility. Owing to presence of nucleophilic and electrophilic&#160;sites, they offer multifunctional sites for the reaction. This review covers a meticulous exploration of their multifaceted role, encompassing an in&#8208;depth analysis of mechanism, extensive scope, limitations and wide&#8208;ranging applications in diverse organic synthesis, covering the literature from the 21st century. This comprehensive review encapsulates the applications of trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls and their synthetic equivalents as precursors of complex and diverse heterocyclic scaffolds, fused heterocycles and spirocyclic compounds having medicinal and material importance. Their potent synthetic utility in cyclocondenation reactions with binucleophiles, cycloaddition reactions, C&#8208;C bond formations, asymmetric multicomponent reactions using classical/solvent&#8208;free/catalytic synthesis have been presented. Influence of unsymmetrical trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketones on regioselectivity of transformation is also reviewed. This review will benefit the synthetic and pharmaceutical communities to explore trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls as trifluoromethyl building blocks for fabrication of heterocyclic scaffolds having implementation into drug discovery programs in the imminent future.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Efficient Polymeric Binders for Transition Metal Oxides&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxide cathodes&#160;(TMOCs) such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 have been widely employed in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to superior operating voltages, high reversible capacities and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, despite significant advancements in practical application, TMOC&#8208;based LIBs face great challenges such as transition metal dissolution and volume expansion during cycling, which jeopardizes the future advance of high&#8208;voltage TMOCs. As a critical component of cathode, polymeric binder acts as a crucial part in maintaining the mechanical and ion/electron conductive integrity between active particles, carbon additives, and the aluminum collector, hence minimizing cathode pulverization during battery cycling. Moreover, Polymeric binder with specialized functions is thought to offer a new solution to enhancing the electrochemical stability of the TMOCs. Therefore, this review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8208;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2:1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating excited states by varying different acceptors of D&#8210;&#960;&#8210;A emitters for efficient non&#8208;doped blue electroluminescence with high luminance and low efficiency roll&#8208;off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chromophores with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state are promising for the realization of high performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The rational manipulation of HLCT excited state for efficient emitters remains challenging. Herein, we present three donor&#8210;&#960;&#8210;acceptor (D&#8210;&#960;&#8210;A) molecules (mPAN, mPANPH, and mPNAPH) with phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole (PI) and pyridinyl as donor and &#960;&#8208;bridge respectively. Changes in various kinds of polycyclic aromatic derivative acceptors (anthracene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 1&#8208;phenylnaphthalene) could manipulate the excited states and optoelectronic properties. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S1 state of mPNAPH exhibits HLCT nature while the other two molecules show local excited (LE) state dominated feature. The photophysical properties also demonstrate this characteristic. Therefore, compared with mPAN and mPANPH, mPNAPH has higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) whether in solutions or neat films.&#160;Ultimately, the non&#8208;doped devices based on these emitters show high luminance larger than 35000 cd m&#8208;2, and high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) larger than 5% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the mPNAPH&#8208;based device displays an excellent performance of pure blue emission at 456 nm with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage coordinate of (0.15, 0.16) and EQEmax of 6.13% that benefited from the HLCT state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Powerful P&#8211;N Connection: Preparative Approaches, Reactivity, and Applications of P&#8208;Stereogenic Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For more than five decades, P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal&#8208;based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long&#8208;known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8211;P+&#8211;X&#8208; (X&#160;=&#160;O,&#160;S,&#160;BH3) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than five decades, P-stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research.

         <dc:description>Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8211;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8211;chromophore&#8211;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements.

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200 ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2.THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While smaller polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes TnRn (POSS) are readily accessible or even commercially available, unambiguously authenticated larger systems (n &gt; 12) have barely been reported. Synthesis and isolation procedures are lengthy, and yields are often very low. Herein, we present the surprisingly straightforward and high&#8208;yielding access to the phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative of a so far only postulated second D3h&#8208;symmetric T14 isomer and with that the largest crystallographically characterized POSS cage with organic substituents. Treatment of the commercially available incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxane with catalytic amounts of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid results in high yields of the T14Ph14 framework, which is isolated in crystalline form by a simple work&#8208;up. D3h&#8208;T14Ph14 was analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The relative energies of all four theoretically possible T14Ph14 isomers were determined by optimization of the corresponding structure using DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>The impact of ortho&#8208;substituents on Bonding in Silver(I) and Halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridines: An In&#8208;depth Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

         <dc:description>The coordination nature of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen and electron&#8208;donating methyl groups for [N&#8211;X&#8211;N]&#8314; (X =I, Br) complexations have been studied using 15N NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 15N NMR chemical shifts reveal iodine(I) and bromine(I) prefer to form complexes with 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and only 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine. The crystalline halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines were characterized by using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, but 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines were unable to form stable crystalline halogen(I) complexes due to the lower nucleophilicity of the pyridinic nitrogen. In contrast, the halogen(I) complexes of 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine, which has a more basic nitrogen, are characterized by X&#8208;crystallography, which complements the 15N NMR studies. DFT calculations reveal that the bond energies for iodine(I) complexes vary between &#8208;291 and &#8208;351 kJmol&#8208;1 and for bromine between &#8208;370 and &#8208;427 kJmol&#8208;1. The bond energies of halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;halopyridines with more nucleophilic nitrogen are 66 &#8208; 76 kJmol&#8208;1 larger than those of analogous 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines with less nucleophilic nitrogen. The experimental and DFT results show that the electronic influence of ortho&#8208;halogen substituents on pyridinic nitrogen leads to a completely different preference for the coordination bonding of halogen(I) ions, providing new insights into bonding in halogen(I) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing&#160;Sialyl&#8208;glycan on Live Cancer Cells by Tailored Boronopeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronic acid&#8208;containing molecules are substantially popularized in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry due to the broad spectrum of covalent conjugations as well as interaction modules offered by the versatile boron atom. Apparently, the WGA peptide (wheat germ agglutinin, 62&#8208;73), which shows a considerably low binding affinity to sialic acid, turned into a selective and &gt;5 folds potent binder with the aid of a suitable boronic acid probe installed chemoselectively. In silico studies prompted us to install BA probes on the cysteine residue, supposedly located in close proximity to the bound sialic acid. In vitro studies revealed that the tailored boronopeptides show enhanced binding ability due to the synergistic recognition governed by selective non&#8208;covalent interactions and cis&#8208;diol boronic acid conjugation. The intense binding is observed even in 10% serum, thus enabling profiling of sialyl&#8208;glycan on cancer cells, as compared with the widely used lectin, Sambucus nigra. The synergistic binding mode between the best boronopeptide (P3) binder and sialic acid was analyzed via 1H and 11B NMR.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;Containing Cycloparaphenylenes and Their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of donor&#8211;acceptor cycloparaphenylenes by incorporating fluorenone is presented, the process yields a selection of four nanohoops that vary in ring size and acceptor strength. Their donor&#8211;acceptor characters were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies as well as electrochemical and computational studies, and the geometries were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring size. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalization or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8211;acceptor chromophores were obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, which revealed that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8211;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.

         <title>Bromine Substitution Improves the Photothermal Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phototheranostic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine substitution enhances the photothermal properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic molecules; this is the outcome of a combination of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The results demonstrate that bromine substitution is promising for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal agents.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8211;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet clinical requirements. In this work, we developed a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#1013;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two times more heat (&#1013;808&#8197;nm&#215;PCE) than their unsubstituted counterpart. We disclose that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR&#8208;II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine substitution is a promising strategy for developing future high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided PTT agents.

         <title>Application of MXene&#8208;based materials for cathode in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 and become the most promising high energy storage system in the future. However, their applications are hindered by insulated feature and volume expansion of sulfur, as well as the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong ability of polysulfides adsorption. Besides, their unique two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, abundant functional groups and adjustability are beneficial to overcome the drawbacks of sulfur cathode. In this review, different mainstream preparation methods and excellent properties of MXenes are summarized. Important achievements and recent progress of MXene&#8208;based cathodes and interlayers applied to cathodes are concluded later. Finally, there are also provided the difficulties and potential uses of MXenes for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Study on the Theranostic Potential of 177Lu&#8208;labeled Biocompatible Covalent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Targeted Radionuclide Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation &#160;for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90 days. The outcome of this work can provide new hints for traditional nanomedicines and promote clinical translation of 177Lu radiolabeled compounds efficiently.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte.&#160; Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation by a Multicomponent Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical bioconjugation of proteins has seen tremendous applications in the past decades, with the booming of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and their use in oncology. While genetic engineering has permitted to produce bespoke proteins featuring key (un&#8208;)natural amino acid residues poised for site&#8208;selective modifications, the conjugation of native proteins is riddled with selectivity issues. Chemoselective strategies are plentiful and enable the precise modification of virtually any residue with a reactive side&#8208;chain; site&#8208;selective methods are less common and usually most effective on small and medium&#8208;sized proteins. In this context, we studied the application of the Ugi multicomponent reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of amine and carboxylate groups on proteins, and antibodies in particular. Through an in&#8208;depth mechanistic methodology work supported by peptide mapping studies, we managed to develop a set of conditions allowing the highly selective modification of antibodies bearing N&#8208;terminal glutamate and aspartate residues. We demonstrated that this strategy did not alter their affinity toward their target antigen and produced an antibody&#8208;drug conjugate with subnanomolar potency. Excitingly, we showed that the high site selectivity of our strategy was maintained on other protein formats, especially on anticalins, for which directed mutagenesis helped to highlight the key importance of a single lysine residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with an unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure&#8208;based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;QZVPP//r2SCAN&#8208;3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100 &#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures are formed via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat&#8208;like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten&#8208;membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder&#8208;ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Juggling Optoelectronics and Catalysis: The Dual Talents of Bench Stable 1,4&#8208;Azaborinines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs) have established a strong foothold in the realm of organic electronics. However, their catalytic potential remains largely untapped. In this study, we synthesise and characterise two bench stable B,N&#8208;doped PAH derivatives based on a 1,4&#8208;azaborinine motif. Most importantly, the anthracene derived structure is an efficient catalyst in the reduction of various carbonyls and imines. These results underscore the potential of B,N&#8208;PAHs in catalytic transformations, setting the stage for deeper exploration in this chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic "self&#8208;activated" precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed [4+3]/[4+1] Cycloaddition of Diene&#8208;Vinylcyclopropanes and Carbon Monoxide to Access Angular 5/7/5 Tricycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected [4+3]/[4+1] reaction of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access challenging 5/7/5 tricycles was developed, together with its mechanistic study by using ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Report here is a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [4+3]/[4+1] cycloaddition of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access compounds with angular 5/7/5 tricyclic skeleton found in natural products. The reaction has broad scope and further transformation of the [4+3]/[4+1] cycloadduct was also investigated. How this [4+3]/[4+1] reaction occurs and why its competing [4+3] reaction is disfavored have been investigated computationally.

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Complexes of Tc and Re for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their favorable chemical features, Re and Tc complexes have been widely used for the development of new therapeutic agents and imaging probes to solve problems of biomedical relevance. This review provides an update of the most relevant research efforts towards the development of novel cancer theranostic agents using Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds interacting with specific DNA structures. This includes a variety of homometallic complexes, namely those containing M(CO)3 (M = Re, Tc) moieties, that exhibit different modes of interaction with DNA, such as covalent binding, intercalation, groove binding or G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding. Additionally, heterometallic complexes, designed to potentiate synergistic effects of different metal centers to improve DNA&#8208;targeting, cytotoxicity and fluorescence properties, are also reviewed. Particular attention is also given to 99mTc&#8208; and 188Re&#8208;labeled oligonucleotides that have been widely explored to develop imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through the in vivo hybridization with a specific complementary DNA or RNA target sequence to provide useful molecular tools in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the need for further improvement of DNA&#8208;targeted Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds as potential therapeutic and diagnostic agents is highlighted, and future directions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes&#160;and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel&#8217;s and Baird&#8217;s rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the thiophene rings. To reduce T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work; in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring(s); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.</dc:description>

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green and environmental protection has been of particular concern in modern chemistry research. In this work, we report a visible&#8208;light photocatalytic molecular reactor based on a novel zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) for the aerobic oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide in water. The Zr&#8208;MOF is constructed from perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand and [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters, and features a 3D (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topological structure with triangular channels of ~5 &#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26 &#197; along c&#8208;axis. Interestingly, this Zr&#8208;MOF exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor in water. When it is used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light in water, the Zr&#8208;MOF could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield, selectivity and superior recyclability. Furthermore, the mechanism studies revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#183;&#8208;) are the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique dynamic configuration&#160;of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99:1.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of a Common&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketiminate NacNac Framework via Sequential Lithiation and Small Molecule Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2&#160;Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2&#160;to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R = isopropyl &gt; adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS = trimethylsilyl, R = p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.</dc:description>
