         <title>Photoredox Catalysis by 21&#8208;Thiaporphyrins: A Green and Efficient Approach for C&#8722;N Borylation and C&#8722;H Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines is reported using 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins. The method is versatile and a series of heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters are prepared in decent yields (up to 88&#8201;%) with only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light. DFT studies suggest that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin donates electron to the substrate and undergo oxidative quenching pathway during the reaction.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis provides a green and sustainable alternative for C&#8722;H activation of organic molecules that eludes harsh conditions and use of transition metals. The photocatalytic C&#8722;N borylation and C&#8722;H arylation mostly depend on the ruthenium and iridium complexes or eosin Y and the use of porphyrin catalysts is still in infancy. A series of novel 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins (A2B2 and A3B type) were synthesized having carbazole/phenothiazine moieties at their meso&#8208;positions and screened as catalysts for C&#8722;N borylation and C&#8722;H arylation. This paper demonstrates the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyzed C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation of anilines under visible light. The method utilizes only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst under blue light for the direct C&#8722;N borylation and het&#8208;arylation reactions. A variety of substituted anilines were used as source for expensive and unstable aryl diazonium salts in the reactions. The heterobiaryls and aryl boronic esters were obtained in decent yields (up to 88&#8197;%). Versatility of the 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin catalyst was tested by thiolation and selenylation of anilines under similar conditions. Mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT studies, suggesting that 21&#8208;thiaporphyrin undergo an oxidative quenching pathway. The photoredox process catalyzed by 21&#8208;thiaporphyrins offers a mild, efficient and metal&#8208;free alternative for the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;Se bonds in aryl compounds; it can also be extended to borylation reaction.

         <title>Transition Behaviors of Isostructural Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Naphthalene, Quinoxaline, and Pyrazinopyrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks based on naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores, have been constructed. Upon removal of guest molecules, these three solvated HOFs underwent transformations through rearrangement of hydrogen bonds. Each transformed structure possesses different intermolecular interactions contributed from atom in the molecular core.







Abstract
A series of isostructural reticular frameworks with systematic differences on chemical structures allows us to disclose correlations between specific structural factors and properties, providing insights for designing novel porous materials. However, even slight differences in the molecular structure often lead to non&#8208;isostructural polymorphic frameworks particularly in the case of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) because the structures of HOFs are based on a subtle balance of reversible interactions. In this study, we found that three simple analogues of tetracarboxylic acids with naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores (NT, QX, and PP, respectively) yielded isostructural solvated HOFs (NT&#8208;1, QX&#8208;1, and PP&#8208;1, respectively), where hydrogen&#8208;bonded sql&#8208;networked sheets were slip&#8208;stacked with closely similar manners. More importantly, these isostructural HOFs underwent structural transformations in different manners upon removal of the guest solvents. Comparison of the crystal structures of the HOFs before and after the transformation revealed that intermolecular interactions of the core significantly affected on rearrangements of hydrogen bonds in the transformation. The results suggest the potential to control the properties and functions of isostructural HOFs by elements in the core.

         <title>Exploiting Nitroreductases for the Tailored Photoenzymatic Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have a broad range of applications and their selective synthesis is very appealing for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Herein we report the usage of the flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductase BaNTR1 for the photoenzymatic synthesis of various anthranils and quinolines from retro&#8208;synthetically designed o&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted carbonyl substrates, achieving high conversions (up to &gt;99%) and good product yields (up to 96%). Whereas the effective production of anthranils required the inclusion of H2O2 in the reaction mixtures to accumulate the needed hydroxylamine intermediates, the formation of quinolines required the use of anaerobic or reducing conditions to efficiently generate the essential amine intermediates. Critical to our success was the high chemoselectivity of BaNTR1, performing selective reduction of the nitro group without reduction of the carbonyl moiety or the activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. The results highlight the usefulness of an innocuous chlorophyll&#8208; and nitroreductase&#8208;based photoenzymatic system for the tailored synthesis of diverse N&#8208;heterocycles from simple nitro compounds.</dc:description>

Their triplet energies were estimated by DFT calculations to be in the range of 52&#8208;57 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1 suggesting their suitability for the [2+2] photocycloaddition of unsaturated acyl imidazoles with styrene derivatives. Experimental studies have shown that 2&#8209;(2&#8209;aminophenyl)benzothiazoles comprising alkylamino groups (NHMe, NHiPr) or the native amino group provide the best photocatalytic results in these visible&#8208;light mediated [2+2] reactions without the need of any additives yielding a range of cyclobutane derivatives. A combined experimental and theoretical approach has provided insights into the underlying triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer process.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization and a Retro&#8208;Ene Reaction Enable the Rapid Fragmentation of a Vitamin B1&#8208;derived Breslow Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solution, analogues of the Breslow intermediate formed during catalysis by benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC) undergo rapid, irreversible fragmentation. The ability of BFDC to prevent this reaction and preserve its&#8217; cofactor is a striking example of an enzyme &#8216;steering&#8217; a reactive intermediate towards a productive pathway. To understand how BFDC suppresses the off&#8208;pathway reactivity of this Breslow intermediate, a clear mechanistic understanding of the fragmentation reaction is required. Here, DFT calculations reveal an unexpected mechanism for the solution&#8208;phase fragmentation that involves an intramolecular cyclization and a subsequent retro&#8208;ene reaction to release the final products. Free energy profiles demonstrate that this pathway is significantly more facile than the previously proposed mechanism that invoked Breslow intermediate enolates as intermediates. Additional computations have been performed to understand why related Breslow intermediates do not undergo analogous fragmentation reactions. Calculations performed with two closely related Breslow intermediates suggest that subtle differences in the relative values of &#8710;G&#8225; for protonation and fragmentation dictate whether a given intermediate will fragment or not. These differences and the fragmentation mechanism unveiled in this work may have ramifications for the mechanism of BFDC and other thiamin&#8208;dependent enzymes and could provide general lessons related to the control of reactive intermediates by enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Ligands: Evaluating the Role of Acidic Protons in the Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To evaluate bifunctional ligand reactivity involving NH acidic sites in the secondary coordination sphere of metal complexes, complexes where the proton has been substituted with a methyl group (NMe) are often investigated. An alternative strategy would involve substitution of the NH group for an O. This contribution considers and compares the merits of these approaches; the synthesis and characterization of cationic square planar Rh carbonyl complexes bearing diprotic bispyrazole pyridine ligand L1, and the bis&#8208;methylated pyrazole pyridine ligand L1Me are described. The syntheses and characterization of the novel monoprotic pyrazole isoxazole pyridine ligand L2 and aprotic bisisoxazole pyridine ligand L3, and their corresponding Rh carbonyl complexes are also described. The different CO stretching frequencies of all four Rh&#8208;complexes suggest that substitutions of NH with NMe, as well as O, lead to significant electronic differences, and these differences are further demonstrated to lead to different ligand addition/substitution reactivities of the four isoelectronic Rh&#8208;complexes. Overall, the results suggest that the electronic differences arising due to NH substitutions can be significant and must be accounted for prior to invoking the participation of the proton.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Fluorenyl&#8208;Based Copolyimines with Adjustable Mechanical Properties, Recyclability and Friction Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and evaluation of Cardo&#8208;DPIs films have been successfully completed. The presence of the fluorenyl effect, along with ether linkages and a high cross&#8208;linking density of dynamic polyimines, has resulted in films that not only demonstrated superior mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing capabilities but also enabled closed&#8208;loop recycling. Furthermore, the friction and wear characteristics of Cardo&#8208;DPIs have been systematically analyzed.







Abstract
Dynamic polyimines are a class of fascinating dynamic polymers with recyclability and reparability owing to their reversible Schiff&#8208;base reactions. However, balancing the dynamic properties and mechanical strength of dynamic polyimines presents a major challenge due to the dissociative and associative nature of the imine bonds. Herein, we introduced bulky fluorene groups and polyether amine into the skeleton of polyimine networks to achieve a tradeoff in comprehensive properties. The resulting dynamic polyimines with fluorene groups (Cardo&#8208;DPIs) were successfully synthesized by combining the rigid diamine 9,9&#8208;bis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)fluorene and the flexible polyether amine, demonstrating a high tensile strength of 64.7&#8197;MPa. Additionally, Cardo&#8208;DPIs films with more content of rigid fluorene groups exhibited higher water resistance, glass transition temperature and wear&#8208;resisting ability. Moreover, the Cardo&#8208;DPIs films not only efficiently underwent thermal reshaping, but also exhibited excellent self&#8208;healing capabilities and chemical degradation in acidic solutions. Furthermore, the resulting films can achieve fully closed&#8208;loop recovery by free amine solution for 2&#8197;h at room temperature. This study broadens the scope of dynamic polyimine materials and promotes the balanced development of their functional and mechanical properties.

         <title>The Structure of Carbon Dioxide at the Air&#8208;Water Interface and its Chemical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to first&#8208;principles simulations, the ability of carbon dioxide to capture an electron at the air&#8208;water interface should be larger than in bulk solution, which opens interesting perspectives for developing more efficient reduction processes.







Abstract
The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air&#8208;water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggest that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface&#8208;rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Metal&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free Multicomponent Radical Sulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of radical sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation) under metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent systems, along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Vinyl sulfones are crucial building blocks in synthetic chemistry and core structural units of pharmaceutically active molecules, thus extensive investigations have been conducted on the construction of these skeletons. In contrast to the classical synthetic approaches, the radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Radical sulfonation of alkynes typically begins with the sulfonyl radical attacking the alkynes, followed by further functionalization. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. However, there is no comprehensive review summarizing the advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation), along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Recyclable Homogeneous Catalysis Enabled by Dynamic Coordination on Rhodium(II) Axial Sites of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;synthetic coordinative functionalization of Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) is employed to engineer homogeneous catalysts for styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions. This dynamic coordinative functionalization does not hinder the catalytic activity of the Rh(II) sites and it can be coupled to ligand&#8208;exchange reactions to precipitate the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating its recovery and reuse.







Abstract
The activity of catalytic nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their surface chemistry, which controls colloidal stability and substrate diffusion toward catalytic sites. In this work, we studied how the outer surface chemistry of nanostructured Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) impacts their performance in homogeneous catalysis. Specifically, through post&#8208;synthetic coordination of aliphatic imidazole ligands onto the exohedral Rh(II) axial sites of Rh&#8208;MOPs, we solubilized a cuboctahedral Rh&#8208;MOP in dichloromethane, thereby enabling its use as a homogeneous catalyst. We demonstrated that the presence of the coordinating ligand on the surface of the Rh&#8208;MOP does not hinder its catalytic activity in styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions, thanks to the dynamic Rh&#8208;imidazole coordination bond. Finally, we used similar ligand exchange post&#8208;synthetic reactions to develop a ligand&#8208;mediated approach for precipitating the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating the recovery and reuse of Rh&#8208;MOPs as homogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linking Networks as Durable Bifunctional Coating for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional AT network coating on Zn anode has been constructed via the reversible dynamic cross&#8208;linking interactions, which not only acts as a solid isolation layer to hinder H2O&#8208;induced side reactions but also induces Zn2+ ion flux and lastingly suppresses the Zn dendrites. As a result, the symmetric cell can maintain a significantly prolonged cycle life of 1087&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The serious dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions on the Zn electrode lead to a significant fading in the cycling performance, hindering the development of commercial applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel bifunctional network coating of dynamically cross&#8208;linking sodium alginate with trehalose has been rationally constructed on the Zn anode (Zn@AT). Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross&#8208;linking, AT network coating is endowed with self&#8208;healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087&#8197;h at large charge/discharge depths of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.

By harnessing the electrophilic intermediates of benzofuryl radical cations supported by DFT calculations, we attain exceptional regioselectivity while eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants. Mechanistic investigations reveal a sequence of events involving the benzofuran radical cation, encompassing the capture of H2O, nucleophilic arene attack, and subsequent deprotonation, ultimately yielding the final benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrocarbon radical, peri&#8208;benzo&#8208;diindenotetracenyl, is described. The helical &#960;&#8208;radical has no peripheral substituents but shows high stability. According to the XRD and theoretical studies, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar's sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |gCD| of 2.4&#215;10&#8722;4. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9&#8197;kJ/mol at 298&#8197;K.







Abstract
Here is described the synthesis and characterization of a stable hydrocarbon radical, peri&#8208;benzo&#8208;diindenotetracenyl, with a helical structure. Although the helical &#960;&#8208;radical has no peripheral substituents, it was stable in the solid and solutions. According to the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar's sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |gCD| of 2.4&#215;10&#8722;4 at 522&#8197;nm. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9&#8197;kJ/mol at 298&#8197;K, which is compatible with that of [5]helicene (108&#8197;kJ/mol).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is described the synthesis and characterization of a stable hydrocarbon radical, &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-benzo-diindenotetracenyl, with a helical structure. Although the helical &#960;-radical has no peripheral substituents, it was stable in the solid and solutions. According to the X-ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations, the radical was best described as an allyl radical fused by five Clar's sextets. The optically resolved enantiomers exhibited mirror image CD spectra with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CD&lt;/sub&gt;| of 2.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; at 522&#8197;nm. The racemization barrier was determined to be 95.9&#8197;kJ/mol at 298&#8197;K, which is compatible with that of &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;helicene (108&#8197;kJ/mol).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Asymmetric Ionic Hybrid Detergents enables Micelles with Scalable Properties including Cell Compatibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric modularity is the new kid on the block that drives the diversification of the detergentome. Modular ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents deliver a new chemical space and design modalities to switch ionic detergent species toxic to cells from monomers to mixtures of monomers and micellar assemblies.







Abstract
Ionic detergents enable applications and cause harm in biospheres due to cell toxicity. The utility of covalent combinations between ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergent headgroups in modulating cell toxicity remains speculative due to the yet rarely explored synthesis. We close this gap and establish the modular synthesis of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. We restructure a combinatorial methallyl dichloride one&#8208;pot coupling into a two&#8208;step coupling, which reduces by&#8208;products, improves product yields, and enables the gram&#8208;scale preparation of asymmetric, cationic/non&#8208;ionic and anionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. Our modular synthesis delivers new modalities for the design of ionic detergents, including an unprecedented scaling of properties that determine applications, such as charge, critical micelle concentration, solubilizing properties, hard water tolerance, and cell compatibility. We uncover that shielding the charge in ionic headgroups can switch the detergent species that is toxic to cells from monomers to mixtures of monomers and micellar assemblies. Establishing the chemistry of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents provides a missing evolutionary link in the structural comparison of ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergents, enables an easy synthesis access to yet unexplored chemical spaces of asymmetric hybrid materials, and delivers new modalities for designing the toxicity of supramolecular nanomaterials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Bis&#8208;Acridinium Tweezer Equilibria Controlled by Multi&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria of multi&#8208;responsive entwined dimers is controlled by both chemical and physical stimuli. Chemical switching allows phase transfer experiments whereas electrochemical switching allows a fine understanding of stabilizing and repulsive forces in these systems. A double mutant analysis exploiting electrochemical data gives a good estimate of the energetic contribution brought by methoxy groups.







Abstract
Protonated and methylated bis&#8208;acridinium tweezers built around a 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridyl and an electron enriched 2,6&#8208;di(p&#8208;anisyl)pyridyl spacer have been synthesized. These tweezers can self&#8208;assemble in their corresponding homodimers and the associated thermodynamic parameters have been probed in organic solvents. The switching properties of the tweezers have been exploited in biphasic transfer experiments showing the shift of the equilibria towards the homodimers. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters of the formation of the reduced methylated homodimers investigated by electrochemical experiments revealed the dissociation of the dimers. Thus, in addition to solvent and temperature, the pH and redox responsiveness of the acridinium units of the tweezers make it possible to modulate to a larger extent the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria.

         <title>Gaining Insights into the Interplay between Optical and Magnetic Properties in Photoexcited Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature depicts the interaction of laser light (here, a red laser) with single&#8208;molecule magnets (here, a Fe10Ln10 ring) which can show altered magnetic behaviour after photoexcitation (as suggested by the perpendicular magnetic field lines). Detection of such phenomena should be performed on different timescales with a multitechnique approach. This allows the relative contributions of interactions of electronic and magnetic states to be elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Braun, A.&#8197;K. Powell and A.&#8208;N. Unterreiner (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400977).

         <title>Fluorination/Dearomatization of C6F5 Groups: An FLP Route to an Electrophilic Borane and Non&#8208;coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature highlights our finding that treatment of B(C6F5)3 adducts and related anions with XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations affords the fluorination of arene rings to give the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L = MeCN, OPEt3) and the anions [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;. These fluorinations proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair, with an exceptionally strong electrophilic cation and a nucleophilic anion. These findings suggest a route to unprecedented boranes and weakly coordinating anions. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z.&#8208;W. Qu, D.&#8197;W. Stephan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401776).

         <title>Asymmetric Kinetic Resolution Polymerization of Racemic Lactide Mediated by Axial&#8208;Chiral Thiourea/Phosphazene Binary Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric kinetic resolution polymerization (AKRP) provides an ideal way to obtain highly isotactic polylactide (PLA) with superior thermal&#8208;mechanical properties from racemic lactide (rac&#8208;LA). However, the development of a new catalytic system with concurrent high activity and selectivity at ambient temperature remains a great challenge. Here, a series of simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs containing axial&#8208;chiral thioureas and commercially available phosphazene bases were designed. These chiral binary organocatalytic pairs allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity for AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186 &#176;C. The highest kinetic resolution coefficient (krel) of 8.5 at 47% conversion was obtained, and D&#8208;LA was preferentially polymerized via kinetic resolution with a maximum selectivity factor (kD/kL) of 18.1, indicating that an enantiomorphic site control mechanism (ESC) was involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Topological Supramolecular Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers (SPs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The dynamic or reversible nature of SPs endows them unique physical and chemical properties, such as self&#8208;adaptive and stimuli&#8208;response abilities. The topological structures of SPs play an important role in determining the physicochemical properties and functionality. Hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) are highly branched 3D macromolecules with linear, dendritic, and terminal units, which makes them versatile candidates for the construction of SPs with fascinating architectures.  The resultant HBP&#8208;based SPs perfectly integrated the dynamic/reversible nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. To date, various types of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies have been constructed, and their potential applications have been explored as well. This article overviews the current progress on self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs. The strategies for construction of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies are discussed. Typical potential applications of the assemblies of HBP&#8208;based SPs are also introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Active Lone Pairs Induced Second Harmonic Generation Responses and Electrocatalytic Activity in Hybrid Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lone pair electrons in the electronic structure of molecules have been a prominent research focus in chemistry for more than a century. Stable s2lone pair electrons significantly influence material properties, including thermoelectric properties, nonlinear optical properties, ferroelectricity, and electro(photo)catalysis.While major advances have been achieved in understanding the influence of lone pair electrons on material characteristics, research on this effect in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials is in its initial stage. In this work, we successfully obtained a novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material incorporating Ge with 4s2 lone pair electrons, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8208;H2O (MeHDabco = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (1). Driven by the stereochemically active lone pair electrons on the Ge2+,&#160;1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21 at room temperature and exhibits good second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Interestingly,&#160;1 also shows electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction due to the existence of lone pair electrons on Ge2+ cations. The electrochemical experiment combined with the DFT&#160;calculations revealed the lone pair electrons act as both an active site for proton adsorption and facilitate the ionization of water. This work not only emphasizes the important role of lone pair electrons in material properties and functions but also provides new insight for designing novel Ge&#8208;based hybrid materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Ordered Mesoporous Polymer as a Versatile, Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light active heterogeneous organophotocatalysts have recently gained considerable interest in organic synthetic community. Ordered mesoporous polymers (OMPs) are highly promising as heterogeneous alternative to traditional precious metal/organic dyes&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of a benzothiadiazole functionalized OMPs (BT&#8208;MPs) through a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; strategy. High ordered periodic porosity, large surface area, excellent stability and rational energy&#8208;band structures guarantee the high catalytic activity of BT&#8208;MPs. As a result, at least six conversions, e.g., the [3+2] cycloaddition of phenols with olefins, the selective oxidation of sulfides, the C&#8208;3 thiocyanation of indole and the aminothiocyanation of &#946;&#8208;keto ester, could be promoted smoothly by BT&#8208;MPs. In addition, BT&#8208;MPs was readily recovered with well maintaining its photocatalytic activity and could be reused for at least eight times. This study highlights the potential of exploiting photoactive OMPs as recyclable, robust and metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Flexible Lewis Pair Ligands: Spectroscopic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new luminescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes with stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible Lewis pair (FlexLP) ligands are described. The FlexLP ligands consist of a dimesitylboron Lewis acid and diphenylphosphine oxide Lewis base which are in equilibrium between the unbound open form and the Lewis adduct, controlled by the hydrogen bond donating strength of the solvent. Spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to interpret the photophysics of the platinum(II) complexes. All complexes exhibit tunable absorption in the region of 300&#8211;500 nm and green to orange photoluminescence, depending on the ratio of weak (THF) to strong (MeOH) hydrogen bond donating solvent employed. Spectroscopic and computational data shows that phosphine and peripheral acetylide ligands on the platinum(II) centers have limited influence on the emission energy, indicating the emission originates from the FlexLP&#8208;dominated fluorescence. Using time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy it is shown that the complexes undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet&#8208;excited state upon photoexcitation, and the ISC efficiency is affected by the peripheral acetylide ligands. The triplet&#8208;excited state lifetime can also be manipulated by the state of the FlexLP ligand, with the closed form complexes having longer lifetimes than the open form complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight from Electrochemical Analysis in the Radical Cation State of a Monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene Based [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules are a class of compounds used for controlling directional movement when barriers can be raised and lowered using external stimuli. Applied voltages can turn on redox states to alter electrostatic barriers but their use for directing motion requires knowledge of their impact on the kinetics. Herein, we make the first measurements on the movement of cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) across the radical&#8208;cation state of monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) in a [2]rotaxane using variable scan&#8208;rate electrochemistry. The [2]rotaxane is designed in a way that directs CBPQT4+ to a high&#8208;energy co&#8208;conformation upon oxidation of MPTTF to either the radical cation (MPTTF&#8226;+) or the dication (MPTTF2+). 1H NMR spectroscopic investigations carried out in acetonitrile at 298 K showed direct interconversion to the thermodynamically more stable ground&#8208;state co&#8208;conformation with CBPQT4+ moving across the oxidized MPTTF2+ electrostatic barrier. The electrochemical studies revealed that interconversion takes place by movement of CBPQT4+ across both the MPTTF&#8226;+ (19.3 kcal mol&#8722;1) and MPTTF2+ (18.7 kcal mol&#8722;1) barriers. The outcome of our studies shows that MPTTF has three accessible redox states that can be used to kinetically control the movement of the ring component in mechanically interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding in Selective Recognition and Liquid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of Perrhenate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient recognition and extraction of hazardous anionic pollutants from water medium is of great significance for environmental concerns, representing a challenging area of research in supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive demonstration of the ability of chalcogen bonding (ChB) to recognize and remove the ReO4&#8208; from 100% water medium. The anion recognition ability is well elucidated through solution phase NMR and ITC studies, which clearly reveal the selective binding of ReO4&#8208; over other oxo&#8208;anions. Moreover, the selenoimidazolium scaffold effectively engages in Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O ChB interaction with ReO4&#8208; as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure and XPS analysis. More importantly, the binding of ReO4&#8208; with different prolongations of the &#963;&#8211;holes, along with Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Se chalcogen bonding interactions, lead to the formation of a 1D supramolecular assembly. Eventually, ChB receptor Se4Me&#8208;Br exhibits ~62% ReO4&#8208; extraction efficiency through precipitation as the extraction method. Furthermore, in efforts to enhance efficiency, a hydrophobic ChB receptor Se4Do&#8208;PF6 has been prepared, achieving an efficiency of up to ~93% at a very low concentration (~5ppm) by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Vacancy Enriched Porous BN Fibers for Enhanced Polysulfides Adsorption and Conversion in High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one&#8208;dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N&#8208;vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as&#8208;prepared S/Nv&#8208;BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347 mAh g&#8208;1 at 200 mA g&#8208;1, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1600 mA g&#8208;1. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect&#8208;engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;Redox Transformations of the OX063 Radical in Biological Media: Oxidative Decay of Initial Trityl with Further Formation of Structurally&#8208;Modified TAM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Being a low&#8208;toxic and hydrophilic representative of TAM, OX063 has shown its suitability for in&#8208;vivo and in&#8208;cell EPR experiments and design of spin labels. Using 13C labeling, we investigated the course of oxidative degradation of OX063 into quinone&#8208;methide (QM) under the influence of superoxide as well as further thiol&#8208;promoted reduction of QM into TAM radical, which formally corresponds to substitution of a carboxyl function by a hydroxyl group. We found these transformations being quantitative in model reactions mimicking specific features of biological media and confirmed the presence of these reactions in the blood and liver homogenate of mice in vitro. The emergence of the trityl with the hydroxyl group can be masked by an initial TAM in EPR spectra and may introduce distortions into EPR&#8208;derived oximetry data if they have been obtained for objects under hypoxia. 13C labeling allows one to detect its presence, considering its different hyperfine splitting constant on 13C1 (2.04 mT) as compared to OX063 (2.30 mT). The potential involvement of these reactions should be considered when using TAM in spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers intended for subsequent EPR experiments, as well as in the successful application of TAM in experiments in vivo and in cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunning Energetics of 2e&#8315;/2H+ PCET Properties with Model Ru&#8208;bisamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most redox processes that break/form bonds involve net 2e&#8722; changes, and many are coupled to protons. Yet most proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) studies focus on 1e&#8211;/1H+ reactions. Reported here is a family of molecular models that undergo tunable 2e&#8211;/2H+ redox changes. Complexes [(X2bpy)RuII(en*)2](PF6)2 and [(X2bpy)RuIV(en*&#8208;H)2](PF6)2 have been synthesized with bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;subtitutions X = &#8208;NMe2, &#8208;OMe, &#8208;Me, &#8208;H, &#8208;CF3; and en* = 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butanediamine. They have been characterized by IR, UV&#8208;vis, and NMR spectroscopies, XRD, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, DFT and (TD)DFT computations. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating groups at the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;position of the bpy ligand affects the complexes&#8217; redox potentials, pKa&#8217;s, and Bond Dissociation Free Energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8208;H bonds in the en* ligands. The average BDFEs for the overall 2e&#8722;/2H+ PCET span over 5 kcal/mol. Notably, these complexes all show marked potential inversion over an extended range, &#916;pKa &gt; 25 units and &#916;E0 &gt; 1.4 V. Potential inversion remains despite the electronic influence of bpy&#8217;s substitutions which regulate N&#8208;H properties several bonds apart by trans&#8208;effect over d&#960;&#8208;molecular orbitals at Ru&#8208;center.&#160;The experimental and computational results presented in this work support the presence of strong coupling between electrons and protons, for modelling&#160;insights&#160;of 2e&#8722;/2H+ transfer reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Selective Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Thyroid Hormone Transporter Activity in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a trans&#8208;membrane transporter, which mediates the cellular delivery of thyroid hormones, L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3  '&#8208;triiodo&#8208;L&#8208;thyronine (T3). In humans, the MCT8 protein is encoded by the SLC16A2 gene and mutations in the transporter cause a genetic neurological disorder known as Allan&#8208;Herndon&#8208;Dudley syndrome (AHDS). MCT8 deficiency leads to impaired transport of thyroid hormones in the brain. Radiolabelled T4 and T3 or LC/MS&#8208;MS methods have been used to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. Herein, we developed a fluorescent based assay to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. A dansyl&#8208;based fluorescent probe having L&#8208;thyroxine moiety is found to be highly selective towards MCT8 in living cells. The high selectivity of the probe towards MCT8 can be attributed to the halogen bond&#8208;mediated recognition by the transporter protein. The presence of a free carboxylic acid group is essential for the specificity of the probe towards MCT8. Additionally, the selectivity of the probe for MCT8 is abolished upon esterification of the carboxylic group. Similarly, MCT8 does not recognize the probe when it contains a free amine group.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Current Density Induced by Uniform Magnetic Fields in Clarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations of the magnetic response are reported for few selected clarenes, the most stable isomers among cycloarenes, as identified by maximization of the number of Clar sextets, and tested computationally. Only some of the rings endowed with a Clar sextet show an exaltation of the diatropic ring current, as could have been expected based on previous calculations on different polycyclics.







Abstract
Some planar and non&#8208;planar clarenes have been studied using maps of magnetically induced quantum&#8208;mechanical current density and tools from differential topology to assess their magnetic response in connection with recent results by Du and Wang. Bond current strengths have been computed to estimate quantitative measures. Isosurfaces of the divergence of induced Lorentz force density have been shown to provide useful additional criteria, especially in the case of non&#8208;planar clarenes.

A sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI)&#8208;based multifunctional electrolyte is developed by partially replacing NaPF6 salt in the electrolyte to improve the wide temperature range working capability of NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2/hard carbon (NNFM111/HC) sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The capacity retention of the SIBs with NaFSI&#8208;NaPF6 dual salt electrolyte increases from 47.2&#8201;% to 75.5&#8201;% after 250 cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and from 51.0&#8201;% to 82.3&#8201;% after 80 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C, and the 1&#8197;C discharge capacity retention at the low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C also increases 26.8&#8201;%. In the single salt system, NaPF6 effectively passivate the aluminum foil and NaFSI passivate the electrode/electrolyte interface. The synergistic effect of NaPF6 and NaFSI greatly improves the battery performance in a wide temperature range. This NaFSI&#8208;based dual salt electrolyte also effectively overcomes the flaws when the SIBs using NaFSI or NaPF6 independently, and makes it more suitable for SIBs, indicating promising prospects in the commercial application of NNFM111/HC SIBs.

         <title>Systems and Methods for Continuous Evolution of Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review underscores possibilities and limitations in applications of continuous gene diversification systems for evolution of enzyme function by showcasing successful evolution campaigns.







Abstract
Directed evolution generates novel biomolecules with desired functions by iteratively diversifying the genetic sequence of wildtype biomolecules, relaying the genetic information to the molecule with function, and selecting the variants that progresses towards the properties of interest. While traditional directed evolution consumes significant labor and time for each step, continuous evolution seeks to automate all steps so directed evolution can proceed with minimum human intervention and dramatically shortened time. A major application of continuous evolution is the generation of novel enzymes, which catalyze reactions under conditions that are not favorable to their wildtype counterparts, or on altered substrates. The challenge to continuously evolve enzymes lies in automating sufficient, unbiased gene diversification, providing selection for a wide array of reaction types, and linking the genetic information to the phenotypic function. Over years of development, continuous evolution has accumulated versatile strategies to address these challenges, enabling its use as a general tool for enzyme engineering. As the capability of continuous evolution continues to expand, its impact will increase across various industries. In this review, we summarize the working mechanisms of recently developed continuous evolution strategies, discuss examples of their applications focusing on enzyme evolution, and point out their limitations and future directions.

         <title>Thermochromic Vanadium Dioxide Nanostructures for Smart Windows and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise summary was provided on the synthesis of VO2 nanostructures based on nanoparticles and thin films. The review covered modulation strategies for the optical properties of VO2, specifically highlighting doping, thermal processing, and structure manipulation to enhance and regulate the thermochromic and emissivity performance of VO2. Finally, representative works showcasing smart window and radiative cooling applications were introduced.







Abstract
The pursuit of energy&#8208;saving materials and technologies has garnered significant attention for their pivotal role in mitigating both energy consumption and carbon emissions. In particular, thermochromic windows in buildings offer energy&#8208;saving potential by adjusting the transmittance of solar irradiation in response to temperature changes. Radiative cooling (RC), radiating thermal heat from an object surface to the cold outer space, also offers a potential way for cooling without energy consumption. Accordingly, smart window and RC technologies based on thermochromic materials can play a crucial role in improving energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption in buildings in response to the surrounding temperature. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a promising thermochromic material for energy&#8208;saving smart windows and RC due to its reversible metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, accompanying large changes in its optical properties. This review provides a brief summary of synthesis methods of VO2 nanostructures based on nanoparticles and thin films. Moreover, this review emphasizes and summarizes modulation strategies focusing on doping, thermal processing, and structure manipulation to improve and regulate the thermochromic and emissivity performance of VO2 for smart window and RC applications. In last, the challenges and recent advances of VO2&#8208;based smart window and RC applications are briefly presented.

         <title>Dead Lithium in Lithium Metal Batteries: Formation, Characterization and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dead lithium in lithium metal batteries plays a negative effect on battery life and capacity retention, however, interface and electrolyte engineering are believed to be effective routes to reduce and/or reuse the dead lithium, which can boost the practical use of lithium metal anode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) replacing graphite anode for developing Li metal batteries (LMB) with the higher energy density has attracted much attention. However, LMA faces many issues, e.&#8201;g., Li dendrites, dead Li and the side reactions, which causes the safety hazards and low coulomb efficiency (CE) of battery, therefore, LMB still cannot replace the current Li ion battery for practical use. Among those issues, dead Li is one of the decisive factors affecting the CE of LMB. To better understand dead Li, we summarize the recent work about the generation of dead Li, its impact on batteries performance, and the strategies to reuse and eliminate dead Li. Finally, the prospect of the future LMA and resultant LMB is also put forward.

Polyionic complexes were used as chemical reservoirs for obtaining a highly efficient cerium&#8208;based catalyst in the photo&#8208;Fenton reaction







Abstract
Hybrid poly&#8208;ion complexes were synthesized through the complexation of a double hydrophilic copolymer with Ce(III) ions. These colloids act as reservoirs for cerium ions, enabling the synthesis of cerium&#8208;based Prussian blue nanoparticles with a cubic structure, a narrow size distribution around 100&#8197;nm, and good colloidal stability in water. Upon high&#8208;temperature calcination, these nanoparticles are transformed into a cerium/iron&#8208;based metal oxide catalyst (CeO2/Fe2O3). The resultant composite catalyst demonstrates superior performance in the photo&#8208;Fenton oxidation of methylene blue pollutants, achieving a conversion efficiency that rivals other metal&#8208;based oxides and cerium&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>A Practical and Modular Method for Direct C&#8722;H Functionalization of the BODIPY Core via Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and modular photochemical method for the direct C&#8722;H functionalization of the BODIPY core with versatile thianthrenium salts to prepare diverse aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY dyes was developed. This mild protocol proceeds with high site&#8208;selectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance, and enabled the synthesis of sophisticated disubstituted BODIPY dyes and the late&#8208;stage BODIPY modification of complex drug molecules.







Abstract
Direct structural modification of small&#8208;molecule fluorophores represents a straightforward and appealing strategy for accessing new fluorescent dyes with desired functionalities. We report herein a general and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated method for the direct C&#8722;H functionalization of BODIPY, an important fluorescent chromophore, using readily accessible and bench&#8208;stable aryl and alkenylthianthrenium salts. This practical approach operates at room temperature with extraordinary site&#8208;selectivity, providing a step&#8208;economical means to construct various valuable aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY dyes. Remarkably, this protocol encompasses a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and allows for the modular synthesis of sophisticated symmetrical and asymmetrical disubstituted BODIPYs by simply employing different combinations of thianthrenium salts. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage BODIPY modification of complex drug molecules further highlights the potential of this novel methodology in the synthesis of fluorophore&#8208;drug conjugates.

         <title>Optimizing Photocatalytic H2 Production by Introduction of Pyrazinyls to WRCs and a New tris&#8208;Rhenium Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polypyridyl&#8208;based cobalt catalysts for the hydrogen evolving reaction were optimized by the introduction of electron&#8208;poor pyrazine in place of pyridine. Photocatalysis experiments with a new tris&#8208;rhenium photosensitizer and detailed electrochemical studies showed trends in turnover numbers and H2 evolution rates and gave grounds for hypotheses on the mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
The replacement of pyridyl by pyrazinyl in ligands of polypyridyl&#8208;based cobalt water reducing catalysts (WRC) shifts reduction potentials anodically. Together with a new, trinuclear ReI photosensitizer, these WRCs show strongly improved photocatalytic performances in turnover numbers (TONs) and maximal H2 evolution rate. Depending on the catalyst structure, up to 65&#8197;kTONs at 1&#8197;&#956;M WRC concentration were reached. Under electrocatalytic conditions in both DMF and H2O, one of the reported WRCs displays remarkable stability, producing H2 steadily over 21 and 14&#8197;d, respectively.

         <title>Quantitative Characterization of RCA&#8208;based DNA Hydrogels &#8211; Towards Rational Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking. This study varied template sequences and reagent concentrations, evaluating RCA synthesis efficiency and hydrogel mechanical properties through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and indentation measurements, respectively. Primer concentration and stabilizing additives showed minimal impact on RCA efficiency, while changes in polymerase and nucleotide concentrations had a stronger effect. Concentration of the circular template exerted the greatest influence on RCA productivity. An exponential correlation between hydrogel viscosity and DNA amplicon concentration was observed, with nucleobase sequence significantly affecting both amplification efficiency and material properties, particularly through secondary structures. This study suggests that combining high&#8208;throughput experimental methods with structural folding prediction offers a viable approach for systematically establishing structure&#8208;property relationships, aiding the rational design of DNA hydrogel material systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimethylene&#8208;Cyclopropanide Units as Building Blocks for Fluorescence Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many organic dyes are fluorescent in solution. In the solid state, however, quenching processes often dominate, hampering material science applications such as light filters, light&#8208;emitting devices, or coding tags. We show that the dimethylene&#8208;cyclopropanide scaffold can be used to form two structurally different types of chromophores, which feature fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.65 in dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.53 in solids. The increased fluorescence in the solid state for compounds bearing malonate substituents instead of dicyanomethid ones is rationalized by the induced twist between the planes of the cyclopropanide core and a pyridine ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen Fixation by Manganese Complexes &#8211; Waiting for the Rush?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of nitrogen fixation, manganese complexes seem to be set back when compared to other early&#8208;to&#8208;mid transition metals. This does not reflect the rush this metal has experienced in homogeneous hydrogenation catalysis and related processes. Giving an overview of the relevant literature, the authors attempt to answer why this metal has not yet made its breakthrough in N2 activation.







Abstract
Manganese is currently experiencing a great deal of attention in homogeneous catalysis as a sustainable alternative to platinum group metals due to its abundance, affordable price and low toxicity. While homogeneous nitrogen fixation employing well&#8208;defined transition metal complexes has been an important part of coordination chemistry, manganese derivatives have been only sporadically used in this research area. In this contribution, the authors systematically cover manganese organometallic chemistry related to N2 activation spanning almost 60&#8197;years, identify apparent pitfalls and outline encouraging perspectives for its future development.

         <title>Zn promoted GaZrOx Ternary Solid Solution Oxide Combined with SAPO&#8208;34 Effectively Converts CO2 to Light Olefins with Low CO Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, Zn was introduced into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. The ZnGaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2, thereby the ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 bifunctional catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance.

We proposed a new strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to prepare light olefins by introducing Zn into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 to prepare a high&#8211;performance ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. By optimizing the Zn doping content, the ratio and mode of the two&#8211;phase composite, and the process conditions, the 3.5&#8201;%ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance and good high&#8211;temperature inhibition of the reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The catalyst achieved 26.6&#8201;% CO2 conversion, 82.1&#8201;% C2=&#8722;C4= selectivity and 11.8&#8201;% light olefins yield. The ZnGaZrOx formed by introducing an appropriate amount of Zn into GaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2. Importantly, the RWGS reaction was also significantly suppressed at high temperatures, with the CO selectivity being only 46.1&#8201;% at 390&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Homochiral and Heterochiral Self&#8208;Sorting Assemblies of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that covalently linked norcorrole dimers formed closely stacked assemblies based on the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems. The supramolecular assembling event of the norcorrole dimers occurred through high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting. The subtle modification in the linking position and peripheral substituents resulted in complete change both in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode.







Abstract
Recently, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems have received considerable attention because they can exhibit stacked&#8208;ring aromaticity due to substantial intermolecular orbital interactions. Here, we report three antiaromatic norcorrole dimers that self&#8208;assemble to form supramolecular architectures through chiral self&#8208;sorting. A 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimer with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups forms a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer both in solid and solution states via homochiral self&#8208;sorting. Its association constant in solution is (3.6&#177;1.7)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 at 20&#8201;&#176;C. In the solid state, 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimers with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Conformational Analysis of (+)&#8208;Germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol Using the Crystalline Sponge Method to Elucidate the Origin of its Instability</title>

The crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a relatively unstable terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol. The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of this terpene, in which two double bonds are in proximity.







Abstract
Unsaturated cyclic terpenes often exhibit instability due to the proximation of C=C bonds in the cyclic skeleton, leading to nonenzymatic degradation. In this study, the crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a minute amount of oily and cyclic terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol, which was produced by a terpene synthase OILTS under in&#8197;vitro conditions. The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of the cyclic terpene with proximal double bonds. Under weakly acidic in&#8197;vivo conditions, OILTS gave four pseudo&#8208;natural products or artifacts. The CS method also elucidated the structures of these degraded compounds, proposing a degradation mechanism triggered by the transannular reactions.

         <dc:description>
The merge of anion&#8208;binding and photoredox catalysis for the modular, in&#8197;situ photocatalytic activation of acridinium salts is reported. This approach leads to an enhancement of the stability and selectivity of the photoactive ion pair species, which proved effective to promote several visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox reactions.







Abstract
The in&#8197;situ generation of active photoredox organic catalysts upon anion&#8208;binding co&#8208;catalysis by making use of the ionic nature of common photosensitizers is reported. Hence, the merge of anion&#8208;binding and photocatalysis permitted the modulation of the photocatalytic activity of simple acridinium halide salts, building an effective anion&#8208;binding &#8211; photoredox ion pair complex able to promote a variety of visible light driven transformations, such as anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to olefins, Diels&#8208;Alder and the desilylative C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Anion&#8208;binding studies, together with steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy analysis, supported the postulated ion pair formation between the thiourea hydrogen&#8208;bond donor organocatalyst and the acridinium salt, which proved essential for unlocking the photocatalytic activity of the photosensitizer.

This study describes the synthesis of Ni single atom containing N&#8208;doped porous hollow carbon nanospheres and explores its supercapacitive properties. An optimized Ni doping, surface area and graphitization improves its electrical conductivity leading to superior charge storage performance. It displays remarkable capacitance with outstanding energy and power density and long cycle life.







Abstract
Ni single atom containing hollow carbon nanospheres with nitrogen doping has been synthesized by carbonization of Ni(NO3)2/phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde polymer/silica composite. The samples have been characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, electron microscopic, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The microstructure and surface area vary with the amount of Ni(NO3)2 employed in the syntheses and the carbonization environment. An optimized amount of nickel and argon as the carbonization gas afford Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar which possesses overall superior features. The uniformly dispersed Ni single atoms within the hollow porous carbon framework fully utilize all the electroactive sites thereby improving the supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar reaches 777&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;% and excellent recyclability.

&lt;p&gt;This study describes the synthesis of Ni single atom containing N-doped porous hollow carbon nanospheres and explores its supercapacitive properties. An optimized Ni doping, surface area and graphitization improves its electrical conductivity leading to superior charge storage performance. It displays remarkable capacitance with outstanding energy and power density and long cycle life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni single atom containing hollow carbon nanospheres with nitrogen doping has been synthesized by carbonization of Ni(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/phloroglucinol-formaldehyde polymer/silica composite. The samples have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, electron microscopic, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The microstructure and surface area vary with the amount of Ni(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; employed in the syntheses and the carbonization environment. An optimized amount of nickel and argon as the carbonization gas afford &lt;b&gt;Ni-1.0@N@HCN-Ar&lt;/b&gt; which possesses overall superior features. The uniformly dispersed Ni single atoms within the hollow porous carbon framework fully utilize all the electroactive sites thereby improving the supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of &lt;b&gt;Ni-1.0@N@HCN-Ar&lt;/b&gt; reaches 777&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;% and excellent recyclability. The energy and power density of &lt;b&gt;Ni-1.0@N@HCN-Ar&lt;/b&gt; are found to be high; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; its energy density is 155.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a power density of 600.3&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. At a high current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; the material shows a high energy density of 118.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with excellent power density of 6003.4&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Photoexcitation of Aqueous Urea Forms Carbamic Acid/Carbamate in Less Than One Picosecond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the photochemistry of aqueous urea under 200&#8197;nm UV irradiation. Besides a low extinction coefficient &#8211; intramolecular vibrational coupling and effective energy dissipation through the water network significantly reduce photodissociation probabilities in contrast to the results of UV photolysis of anhydrous urea in noble gas matrices. The reults underscore the protective role of water in prebiotic chemistry and suggest a unique pathway for the formation of key feedstock molecules in the absence of biological catalysts like urease.







Abstract
Urea is believed to have been essential to the synthesis of prebiotic nucleotides and thereby the RNA or DNA of the first lifeforms. Models suggesting that life began in wet&#8208;dry cycles around shallow aquatic ponds imply that reactants such as urea were exposed to deep ultraviolet irradiation from the young sun. Detrimental photodissociation of urea induced by deep UV excitation potentially challenges these models. We here follow the primary deep ultraviolet photochemistry of aqueous urea. The data show that urea is barely excited at 200&#8197;nm due to weak ultraviolet absorption. The likelihood of photodissociation is further reduced by strong intra&#8208;molecular coupling of the CN and CO stretch vibrations accompanied by an efficient dissipation of the excitation energy to the surrounding water molecules mitigated by urea&#8208;water hydrogen bonds. We find that 54&#177;5&#8201;% of the excited urea molecules dissociate. Reactions between the photoproducts and surrounding solvent molecules form carbamic acid or the carbamate anions within 0.6&#8197;ps. The molecules that do not dissociate return to the electronic ground state in 2&#8197;ps. Interestingly, the photodissociation processes of urea in the aqueous phase is different from earlier reported reactions observed following the VUV photolysis of urea in noble gas matrices and highlight the potential influence of water on the prebiotic photochemistry.

         <title>Thio and Seleno&#8208;Psoralens as Efficient Triplet Harvesting Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the role of exocyclic replacement of carbonyl oxygen of psoralen with sulfur and selenium. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies revealed a significant red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased oscillator strength, and spin&#8208;orbit coupling values, along with reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps in thio and seleno derivatives of psoralen. These factors led to efficient triplet harvesting, enabling them as promising photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The Psoralen (Pso) molecule finds extensive applications in photo&#8208;chemotherapy, courtesy of its triplet state forming ability. Sulfur and selenium replacement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen of organic chromophores foster efficient triplet harvesting with near unity triplet quantum yield. These triplet&#8208;forming photosensitizers are useful in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) applications for selective apoptosis of cancer cells. In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin&#8208;orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&#8722;5&#8197;s for Pso to 10&#8722;8&#8197;s for TPso and 10&#8722;9&#8197;s for SePso. The intramolecular photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115&#8197;GM of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8211;1050&#8197;nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lanthanide&#8211;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Cycloaddition of CO2 with Epoxides and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8211;organic framework (HE&#8208;LnMOF) heterogeneous catalyst toward sustainable CO2 conversion reactions. The five rare earth metals were well&#8208;dispersed and randomly distributed in the structure. The HE&#8208;LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, abundant Lewis acid and base interaction sites at the same time. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;metallic Ln3+ ions endow it with outstanding catalytic performance.







Abstract
Multimetallic synergistic effects have the potential to improve CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reaction processes, outperforming monometallic MOFs. The results demonstrate superior performance in these processes. To investigate this, we created and characterized a selection of single&#8208;component Ln(III)&#8208;MOFs (Ln=Eu, Tb, Gd, Dy, Ho) and high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8208;organic framework (HE&#8208;LnMOF) using solvent&#8208;thermal conditions. The experiments revealed that HE&#8208;LnMOF exhibited heightened catalytic efficiency in CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reactions compared to single&#8208;component Ln(III) MOFs. Moreover, the HE&#8208;LnMOF displayed significant stability, maintaining their structural integrity after five cycles while sustaining elevated conversion and selectivity rates. The feasible mechanisms of catalytic reactions were also discussed. HE&#8208;LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, acting as Lewis acid sites, with oxygen atoms connecting the metal, and hydroxyl groups on the ligand serving as base sites. This study introduces a novel method for synthesizing HE&#8208;LnMOF and presents a fresh application of HE&#8208;LnMOF for converting CO2.

         <title>Unusual Photochemistry in Aromatic Dithioimides: Quantitative Thione Reduction Promoted by Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the photochemical reaction of dithioimide (2SS) in ether&#8208;containing solvents. While 2SS undergoes photooxidation in the presence of oxygen (forming 2OO), under glove&#8208;box conditions it undergoes an unusual but efficient photoreduction to form 2SH2. Reaction product studies and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving the THF radical.

We report a mechanistic investigation of an aromatic dithioimide (2SS) displaying puzzling yet efficient photochemistry in ether solvents. Perplexingly, 2SS dissolved in ether solvents in a sealed and degassed vial was photochemically converted to the corresponding diimide (2OO), as determined by 1H NMR following product extraction. With no external sources of oxygen in the sample, could the oxygen in 2OO be from the ether itself? To study this unprecedented proposition, we attempt to uncover the ether's involvement in this reaction. As seen by laser&#8208;flash photolysis, 2SS appears to first react with the solvent from its singlet excited state. Following the reaction by NMR under rigorously oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;free conditions led to the identification of a photoreductive pathway that quantitatively transformed one thione into a methylene to yield 2SH2. Subsequent oxidation of 2SH2 or irradiation of 2SS under air proved that molecular oxygen was indeed necessary to observe an oxidative pathway leading to 2OO, ruling out the initially proposed involvement of an ether oxygen. An explanation of 2SS desulfurization was further revealed through the study of solvent by&#8208;products by GC&#8208;MS analysis. Supported by DFT calculations, a mechanism is proposed to involve a chain reaction initiated by photochemically generated ether radical.

&lt;p&gt;Here we report the photochemical reaction of dithioimide (&lt;b&gt;2SS&lt;/b&gt;) in ether-containing solvents. While &lt;b&gt;2SS&lt;/b&gt; undergoes photooxidation in the presence of oxygen (forming &lt;b&gt;2OO&lt;/b&gt;), under glove-box conditions it undergoes an unusual but efficient photoreduction to form &lt;b&gt;2SH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Reaction product studies and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving the THF radical.

         <title>Classification and Identification of Perfume Scents by an Enantioselective Colorimetric Sensor Array of Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Films</title>

         <dc:description>
A colorimetric sensor array made of Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot films based on different chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks is presented. The color changes as response to analyte vapor molecules. The sensors respond enantioselectively for chiral vapor molecules. In combination with a common smartphone camera, the sensor array is used as simple and cost&#8208;efficient system to detect and identify a large number of perfume samples.







Abstract
Many odors, like perfumes, are complex mixtures of chiral and achiral molecules where the cost&#8208;efficient (enantio&#8722;)selective sensing represents a major technical challenge. Here, we present a colorimetric sensor array of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (SURMOF) films in Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities. The optical properties of the FP&#8208;SURMOF films with different chiral and achiral structures are affected by the (enantio&#8722;)selective adsorption of the analytes in the SURMOF pores, resulting in different responses to the analyte molecules. The read&#8208;out of the sensor array is performed by the digital camera of a common smartphone, where the RGB values are determined. By analyzing the sensor array data with simple machine learning algorithms, the analytes are discriminated. After demonstrating the enantioselective response for a pair of pure chiral odor molecules, we apply the sensor array to detect and discriminate a large number (16) of common commercial perfumes and eau de toilettes. While our untrained human nose is not able to discriminate all perfumes, the presented colorimetric sensor array can classify all perfumes with great classification accuracy. Moreover, the sensor array was used to identify unlabeled samples correctly. We foresee such an FP&#8208;chiral&#8208;SURMOF&#8208;based sensor array as a powerful approach toward inexpensive selective odors sensing applications.

         <title>Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Resistance of Lithium&#8208;Metal Rechargeable Batteries Based on Electrolyte Including Ethyl Acetate and LiDFOB Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the solvent structure and reducing the desolvation energy enables the electrolyte to withstand high voltages and low temperatures. Li//LCO and HC//LCO batteries using this electrolyte can still operate within the voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5&#8197;V at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, exhibiting high discharge specific capacities and long cycling performance.







Abstract
To meet the demand for higher energy density in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and expand their application range, coupling lithium metal anodes with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is an ideal solution. However, the compatibility between lithium metal batteries and electrolytes affects their applicability. In this study, proposes a locally concentrated electrolyte based on ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the lithium salt, and lithium difluorooxoborate (LiDFOB) as a sacrificial agent to enhance the low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage endurance of Li//Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) batteries. The Li//LCO battery can operate within the voltage range of 3 to 4.5&#8197;V, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 174.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8201;&#176;C. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 87.7&#8201;%. It can operate under extreme conditions of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C, with a discharge specific capacity of 112.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, LCO//HC batteries using this electrolyte demonstrate excellent performance. Present work provides a new perspective for the optimization of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Keplerate&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Higher Performance via the Morphology Modulation of Blackberry Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>

Keplerate&#8208;type Polyoxometalates (POMs) can self&#8208;assemble to form larger black strawberry structures. We prepare the larger roughness and higher surface potential of film through spin&#8208;coating, which is first used as the positive tribe&#8208;material in the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The TENG has a higher heat resistance and stability and has been applied in the wearable era with better output performance.







Abstract
The tribe&#8208;material is the key factor affecting the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Inorganic materials have higher heat resistance and stability than widely used organic materials. However, the weaker tribe&#8208;property limits the application of TENGs. Modulating surface roughness by changing particle shape and size is a simple way to increase performance for TENGs. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have unrivalled structural diversity and can self&#8208;assemble to form different nanostructures. In this study, we propose [{(NH4)42[Mo72VIMo60VO372(CH3COO)30 (H2O)72]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ca.300H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ca.CH3COONH4)}&#8208;Mo132] and [{Na8K14(VO)2[{(MoVI) (Mo5VIO21)(H2O)3]}10{(MoVI)Mo5VIO21(H2O)3 (SO4)}2{VIVO(H2O)20} {VIVO}10({KSO4}5)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;150H2O)}&#8208;Mo72V30] with blackberry structure which are cured and prepared into film by spin&#8208;coating technique, are used as positive tribe&#8208;materials for the first time in the field of TENGs. Keplerate&#8208;type POMs can form blackberry structures with higher dispersibility and flexibility, which can be used to control surface roughness by regulating the size of particles. The discovery proves that the particle size influences the surface roughness, which adjusts the output of TENGs. According to our findings, Mo132&#8208;h&#8208;TENG generates an output voltage of 29.3&#8197;V, an output charge of 8 Nc, which is 2&#8211;3 folds higher than Mo132&#8208;TENG, and a maximum power density of 6.25&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2 at 300&#8197;M&#937;. Our research provides that altering the dimensional size can be an available way to raise the output of TENGs.

         <title>Robust Radicals Featuring B&#8208; and N&#8208;Embedded Dioxygen&#8208;Bridged Units: Synthesis, Structures, and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged units with special electronic effect are introduced to the TTM unit to construct stable luminescent radicals (BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM). NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm, while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) group has been widely used for constructing organic radicals, but the poor optical stabilities limit the application prospects of the TTM radicals. In this work, the rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged (BO and NO) units were attached to the TTM skeleton as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups, respectively. The rigidity and strong electronic effect of the BO and NO units contribute to the high chemical and optical stability of BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM radicals. Notably, NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm (100&#8197;meV), while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm (130&#8197;meV). This study has developed a methodology to produce highly efficient and enduring luminescent radicals, which could tune emission properties such as wavelength and FWHM.

         <title>Crystalline CdS/Amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibits a highest CO Faradaic efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. Meanwhile, the CO Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90&#8201;% can be obtained in a wide potential window of 1000&#8197;mV with the maximum CO partial current density of 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90&#8201;%) under a wide potential window of 1.0&#8197;V, with the highest value reaching ~100&#8201;% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.

         <title>Tandem Four&#8208;Component Reaction to Access Fused Polycycles Exhibiting Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of fused polycyclic compounds were synthesized efficiently through tandem four&#8208;component reactions that incorporated a chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based dicarbaldehyde, malonitrile and two carbonyl acetonitriles. Notably, Aggregation&#8208;enhanced through&#8208;space charge transfer emission could be observed based on the polycyclic spacer. Theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication.







Abstract
Rapid construction of new fluorescence emitters is essential in advancing synthetic luminescent materials. This study illustrated a piperidine&#8208;promoted reaction of chiral dialdehyde with benzoylacetonitrile and malonitrile, leading to the formation of the 6/6/7 fused cyclic product in good yield. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a dual condensation/cyclization process, achieving the formation of up to six bonds for fused polycycles. The single crystal structure analysis revealed that the fused cyclic skeleton contains face&#8208;to&#8208;face naphthyl and cyanoalkenyl motifs, which act as the electronic donor and acceptor, respectively, potentially resulting in through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emission. While the TSCT emissions were weak in solution, a notable increase in luminescence intensity was observed upon aggregation, indicating bright fluorescent light. A series of theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication based on frontier molecular orbitals, the distance of charge transfer, and reduced density gradient analysis. This work not only provides guidance for the one&#8208;step synthesis of complex polycycles, but also offers valuable insights into the design of aggregation&#8208;enhanced TSCT emission materials.

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of S&#8208;protected cysteine and the corresponding cysteine sulfoxide with increasing acidity of the reaction allowed one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide formation for insulin synthesis. The stepwise disulfide bonding system employed is unprecedented. In addition, the sulfoxide&#8208;mediated protocol enabled one&#8208;pot synthesis of a lipidated insulin analogue.







Abstract
An advanced insulin synthesis is presented that utilizes one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide bond formation enabled by acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxides in the presence of chloride anion. S&#8208;chlorocysteine generated from cysteine sulfoxides reacts with an S&#8208;protected cysteine to afford S&#8208;sulfenylsulfonium cation, which then furnishes the disulfide or reversely returns to the starting materials depending on the S&#8208;protection employed and the reaction conditions. Use of S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys(Acm)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) selectively give the disulfide under weak acid conditions in the presence of MgCl2 even if S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine (Cys(MBzl)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) are also present. In contrast, the S&#8208;MBzl pair yields the disulfide under more acidic conditions in the presence of a chloride anion source. These reaction conditions allowed a one&#8208;pot insulin synthesis. Additionally, lipidated insulin was prepared by a one&#8208;pot disulfide&#8208;bonding/lipidation sequence.

         <title>Direct Comparative Studies Revealing the Contribution of TADF Activity of Organic Emitters Towards Efficient Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented four Carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile molecules possessing similar properties to facilitate a fairer comparison, thereby highlighting the influence of TADF on improving ECL. Intense ECL emission was observed from 4CzBN, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties has attracted considerable interest, showcasing their potential for 100&#8201;% exciton harvesting, which marks a significant advancement in the realm of organic ECL. However, the challenge of elucidating the precise contribution of TADF to the enhanced ECL efficiency arises due to the lack of comparative studies of organic compounds with or without efficient TADF properties. In this study, we present four carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile molecules possessing similar chemical structures and comparable exchange energy (&#916;EST). Despite their comparable properties, these compounds exhibited varying TADF efficiencies, warranting a closer examination of their underlying structural and electronic characteristics governing the optical properties. Consequently, intense ECL emission was only observed from 4CzBN with a remarkable TADF efficiency, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL signal among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.

         <title>Tridentate Lewis Acids Based on Tribenzotriquinacene Chalices</title>

Dedicated to Professor Lothar Weber on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday.Chalice&#8208;type tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the C3v symmetric tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) have been synthesised and were studied regarding their complexation behaviour with (poly&#8208;)Lewis bases, that led to the synthesis of a tridentate base with a TBTQ backbone. The host&#8208;guest adducts were studied in more detail by DOSY NMR experiments to gain information about the size of the aggregates in solution.







Abstract
Chalice&#8208;shaped tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) scaffold have been synthesised. Stannylation of the alkyne units, attached via phenyl&#8208;spacers to the benzhydrylic positions to the TBTQ scaffold, with Me2NSnMe3 afforded the trimethyltin substituted TBTQ derivative. Replacement of these tin functions with other elements resulted in rigid boron&#8208; and aluminium&#8208;functionalised PLAs. More flexible PLAs were obtained by hydrometallation reactions of the terminal alkyne groups of 4b,8b,12b&#8208;tris((ethynyl)phenyl)tribenzotriquinacene. The resulting poly&#8208;Lewis acids were tested for their acceptor abilities in host&#8208;guest experiments with suitable bases. Preliminary tests with pyridine led to the synthesis of a large tridentate base with three pyridyl groups attached to a TBTQ backbone. Complexation of this Lewis base with the PLAs resulted in the formation of aggregates, which were studied in solution in more detail by 1H DOSY NMR experiments regarding their size. Further experiments were performed with the tridentate bases 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane and tris((dimethylphosphino)methyl)phenylsilane.

         <title>Rational Design of Coumarin&#8208;Based Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Blue Emitters for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarins were employed as new acceptors to construct HLCT emitters, namely pPh&#8208;7M, pPh&#8208;7P, and pPh&#8208;6M. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by the connection site and substituent of coumarins. The solution&#8208;processed OLED devices based on pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components realized the champion EQEmax of 6.54&#8201;%, and deep&#8208;blue emission wavelength at 446&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the &#8220;hot excitons&#8221; channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7P), 7&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7M), and 6&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7&#8208;position and the substituent at C3&#8208;position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh&#8208;7P, pPh&#8208;7M, and pPh&#8208;6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution&#8208;processed doped OLEDs based on pPh&#8208;6M exhibited deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446&#8197;nm, maximum luminance of 8755&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, maximum current efficiency of 5.83&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54&#8201;%. The results reveal that pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components has better OLED performance.

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Mediated Electronic Structure Modulation in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise and multiple modifications toward linkage lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8208;A effect, thus boosting photogenerated carrier separation and migration, enabling remarkably promoted photoctalytic HER performance, which highlights the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.







Abstract
Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene&#8208;based COFs with abundant donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well&#8208;modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 by the protonated quinoline&#8208;linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that multiple modifications toward linkage synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8722;A effect, making TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3 a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration. This study provides important guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.

&lt;p&gt;Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF-based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene-based COFs with abundant donor-acceptor (D&#8722;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well-modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; by the protonated quinoline-linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT-PQCOF-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that multiple modifications toward linkage synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;-conjugation and reinforced D&#8722;A effect, making TT-PQCOF-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration. This study provides important guidance for the design of high-performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage-mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational modeling approach is applied to rationalize the impact of streptavidin mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura synthesis of binaphthyls by means of an Artificial Metalloenzyme built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology. The integrative computational approach includes DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.

         <title>Ytterbium(II) Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Single and Double Hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>

Ytterbium and calcium amides supported by hemilabile silaimine&#8208;functionalized cyclopentadienyl ligands (C5Me4&#8208;Si(L)=NR) enabled catalytic single and double hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphines, producing homoallenyl phosphines and (E)&#8208;propenylene diphosphines selectively under mild conditions.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Enynes with conjugated alkene and alkyne moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry. However, neither 4,1&#8208;hydrophosphination nor dihydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes has been reported. In this paper, the divalent ytterbium and calcium amide complexes supported by silaimine&#8208;functionalized cyclopentadienyl ligands (C5Me4&#8208;Si(L)=NR) were developed, which successfully catalyzed the efficient single and double hydrophosphination of 1,3&#8208;enynes with diarylphosphines. The hydrophosphination reactions selectively produced homoallenyl phosphines and (E)&#8208;propenylene diphosphines, respectively. This work demonstrated the potential of hemilabile silaimine&#8208;Cp ligands in the supporting the efficient and selective rare&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth catalysts.

         <title>Stable Axially Chiral Cyclohexylidenes from Catalytic Asymmetric Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic asymmetric Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones with N&#8208;protected oxindoles and benzofuranones catalyzed by a bispidine&#8208;based chiral amine was reported. A series of cyclohexylidenes with stable axial chirality were obtained in good yields and fairly good er.







Abstract
Axially chiral cycloalkylidenes are interesting but less developed axially chiral molecules. Here, a bispidine&#8208;based chiral amine catalytic system was developed to promote efficiently the asymmetric Knoevenagel condensation of N&#8208;protected oxindoles and benzofuranones with 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones. A variety of alkylidenecycloalkanes with stable axial chirality were obtained in good yields and fairly good er (enantiomeric ratio). Based on the absolute configuration determination of product and DFT calculations, a possible mechanism of stereoselective induction was proposed.

The outstanding rate performance, stability and high capacity of aqueous proton batteries has attracted numerous attentions. We development a new aqueous proton battery system with organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials (WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI).

It can play a certain enlightening role in the research and development of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries have received increasing attention due to their outstanding rate performance, stability and high capacity. However, the selection of anode materials in strongly acidic electrolytes poses a challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous proton batteries. This study optimized the proton reaction kinetics of layered metal oxide WO3 by introducing interlayer structural water and coating polyaniline (PANI) on its surface to prepare organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material (WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI). We constructed an aqueous proton battery with WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI anode and MnO2@GF cathode. After 1500 cycles at a current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacity retention rate can still reach 80.2&#8201;%. These results can inspire the development of new aqueous proton batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling Exhibiting Unexpectedly Small Primary Kinetic Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model reaction occurring exclusively via H&#8208;atom QMT at cryogenic temperatures shows unexpectedly small primary H/D KIEs. Evidence suggests that these surprising results arise due to the coupling of the migrating H/D tunneling particle with the N2 matrix medium. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.







Abstract
Probing quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in chemical reactions is crucial to understanding and developing new transformations. Primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) beyond the semiclassical maximum values of 7&#8211;10 (room temperature) are commonly used to assess substantial QMT contributions in one&#8208;step hydrogen transfer reactions, because of the much greater QMT probability of protium vs. deuterium. Nevertheless, we report here the discovery of a reaction model occurring exclusively by H&#8208;atom QMT with residual primary H/D KIEs. 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenylnitrene, generated in N2 matrix, was found to isomerize to an imino&#8208;ketone via sequential (domino) QMT involving anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization (rate determining step) and [1,4]&#8208;H shift reactions. These sequential QMT transformations were also observed in the OD&#8208;deuterated sample, and unexpected primary H/D KIEs between 3 and 4 were measured at 3 to 20&#8197;K. Analogous residual primary H/D KIEs were found in the anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization QMT of 2&#8208;cyanophenol in a N2 matrix. Evidence strongly indicates that these intriguing isotope&#8208;insensitive QMT reactivities arise due to the solvation effects of the N2 matrix medium, putatively through coupling with the moving H/D tunneling particle. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A model reaction occurring exclusively via H-atom QMT at cryogenic temperatures shows unexpectedly small primary H/D KIEs. Evidence suggests that these surprising results arise due to the coupling of the migrating H/D tunneling particle with the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix medium. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probing quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in chemical reactions is crucial to understanding and developing new transformations. Primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) beyond the semiclassical maximum values of 7&#8211;10 (room temperature) are commonly used to assess substantial QMT contributions in one-step hydrogen transfer reactions, because of the much greater QMT probability of protium vs. deuterium. Nevertheless, we report here the discovery of a reaction model occurring exclusively by H-atom QMT with residual primary H/D KIEs. 2-Hydroxyphenylnitrene, generated in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix, was found to isomerize to an imino-ketone via sequential (domino) QMT involving &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; OH-rotamerization (rate determining step) and [1,4]-H shift reactions. These sequential QMT transformations were also observed in the OD-deuterated sample, and unexpected primary H/D KIEs between 3 and 4 were measured at 3 to 20&#8197;K. Analogous residual primary H/D KIEs were found in the &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; OH-rotamerization QMT of 2-cyanophenol in a N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix. Evidence strongly indicates that these intriguing isotope-insensitive QMT reactivities arise due to the solvation effects of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrix medium, putatively through coupling with the moving H/D tunneling particle. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric and Chemoselective Iridium Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Conjugated Unsaturated Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxime ethers is described. The hydrogenation reaction proceeded smoothly at (20&#8211;50&#8197;bar) room temperature. The generated chiral oxime ethers showed good isolated yields and excellent enantioselectivity (84&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, &gt;97&#8201;% ee). The hydrogenation products could be further hydrolysed to chiral ketones.







Abstract
Research on the chemoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of conjugated &#960;&#8208;systems has mostly been focussed on enones. Herein, we communicate the understudied asymmetric hydrogenation of enimines catalyzed by N,P&#8208;iridium complexes and chemoselective toward the alkene. A number of enoxime ethers underwent hydrogenation smoothly to yield the desired products in high yield and stereopurity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;% ee). No hydrogenation of the C=N &#960;&#8208;bond was observed under the applied reaction conditions (20&#8197;bar H2, rt, DCM). It was demonstrated that the chiral oxime ether could be hydrolyzed into the ketone with complete preservation of the installed stereogenity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon. At last, a binding mode of the substrate to the active iridium catalyst and the consequence for the stereoselective outcome was proposed.

A practical method for the preparation of a wide range of 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters using Pd&#8208;catalysis is described that combines typically high yields, high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereocontrol under mild operating conditions. The target compounds find application in the synthesis of a range of bifunctional scaffolds that have potential in complex molecule synthesis.







Abstract
(Z)&#8208;alkenes are useful synthons but thermodynamically less stable than their (E)&#8208;isomers and typically more difficult to prepare. The synthesis of 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;bifunctionalized (Z)&#8208;alkenes is particularly challenging due to the inherent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues. Herein we demonstrate a general, chemoselective and direct synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters. The protocol operates within a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acyloxylation regime involving vinyl ethylene carbonates (VECs) and various carboxylic acids as the reaction partners under mild and operationally attractive conditions. The newly developed process allows access to a structurally diverse pool of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters in good yields and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Various synthetic transformations of the obtained (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters demonstrate how these synthons are of great use to rapidly diversify the portfolio of these formal desymmetrized (Z)&#8208;alkenes.

         <title>Spectroscopy and Photochemistry of [Al, N, C, O, H]: Connectivity to Aluminium&#8208;Bearing Species in the Universe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Al&#8208;bearing molecules consisting of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] have been prepared and characterized in cryogenic argon matrix. The photochemistry of these candidate interstellar species, along with their dissociation reactions to the astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules, has been disclosed.







Abstract
Aluminium is one of the most abundant metals in the universe and impacts the evolution of various astrophysical environments. Currently detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules represent only a small fraction of the aluminium budget, suggesting that aluminium may reside in other species. AlO and AlOH molecules are abundant in the oxygen&#8208;rich supergiant stars such as VY Canis Majoris, a stellar molecular factory with 60+ molecules including the prebiotic NC&#8208;bearing species. Additional Al&#8208;bearing molecules with N, C, O, and H may form in O&#8208;rich environments with radiation&#8208;accelerated chemistry. Here, we present spectroscopic identification of novel aluminium&#8208;bearing molecules composed of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] from the reactions of Al atoms and HNCO in solid argon matrix, which are potential Al&#8208;bearing molecules in space. Photoinduced transformations among six [Al, N, C, O, H] isomers and three [Al, N, C, O] isomers, along with their dissociation reactions forming the known interstellar species, have been disclosed. These results provide new insight into the chemical network of astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing species in space.

Electrosynthesis of dihydroxycoumestan and its application as topoisomerase I poison.







Abstract
Coumestan represents a biologically relevant structural motif distributed in a number of natural products, and the rapid construction of related derivatives as well as the characterization of targets would accelerate lead compound discovery in medicinal chemistry. In this work, a general and scalable approach to 8,9&#8208;dihydroxycoumestans via two&#8208;electrode constant current electrolysis was developed. The application of a two&#8208;phase (aqueous/organic) system plays a crucial role for success, protecting the sensitive o&#8208;benzoquinone intermediates from over&#8208;oxidation. Based on the structurally diverse products, a primary SAR study on coumestan scaffold was completed, and compound 3&#8201;r exhibited potent antiproliferative activities and a robust topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitory activity. Further mechanism studies demonstrates that compound 3&#8201;r was a novel Top1 poison, which might open an avenue for the development of Top1&#8208;targeted antitumor agent.

         <title>Controlling the Uptake and Release of Semiochemicals in Channel&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Through Pore Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of Zr(IV)&#8208; and Al(III)&#8208;based MOFs containing sequentially expanded 1D&#8208;channel pores were investigated for the uptake and controlled release of semiochemicals. Through pore expansion, control over the degree of uptake and release dynamics of these biological messenger molecules was achieved, with the stability of these frameworks allowing for regeneration and re&#8208;use with near identical re&#8208;release profiles.







Abstract
Semiochemicals can be used to manipulate insect behaviour for sustainable pest management strategies, but their high volatility is a major issue for their practical implementation. Inclusion of these molecules within porous materials is a potential solution to this issue, as it can allow for a slower and more controlled release. In this work, we demonstrate that a series of Zr(IV) and Al(III) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with channel&#8208;type pores enable controlled release of three semiochemicals over 100&#8197;days by pore size design, with the uptake and rate of release highly dependent on the pore size. Insight from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations indicates that this is due to weaker MOF&#8208;guest interactions per guest molecule as the pore size increases. These MOFs are all stable post&#8208;release and can be reloaded to show near&#8208;identical re&#8208;release profiles. These results provide valuable insight on the diffusion behaviour of volatile guests in MOFs, and for the further development of porous materials for sustainable agriculture applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Styrylbenzazole Photoswitches and Evaluation of their Photochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches, which exhibit interesting properties, such as high thermal stabilities of the Z isomers, high quantum yields and negative photochromism. Furthermore, we found that the thermal stability, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelength and photostationary state distributions can be tuned by modifying the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring.







Abstract
Styrylbenzazoles form a promising yet under&#8208;represented class of photoswitches that can perform a light&#8208;driven E&#8208;Z isomerization of the central alkene double bond without undergoing irreversible photocyclization, typical of the parent stilbene. In this work, we report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches. Their thermal stabilities, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelengths and photostationary state (PSS) distributions can be tuned by changing the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring. In particular, we found that push&#8208;pull systems show large redshifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths and the highest quantum yields, whereas ortho&#8208;substituted styrylbenzazole photoswitches exhibit the most favorable PSS ratios. Taking advantage of both design principles, we produced 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;styrylbenzothiazole, a thermally stable and efficient P&#8208;type photoswitch which displays negative photochromism upon irradiation with visible light up to 470&#8197;nm to obtain a near&#8208;quantitative isomerization with a very high quantum yield of 59&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4&#8208;hydroxystyrylbenzoxazole was demonstrated to be a pH&#8208;sensitive switch which exhibits a 100&#8197;nm redshift upon deprotonation. Ortho&#8208;methylation of its benzothiazole analogue improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from E&#8201;:&#8201;Z=53&#8201;:&#8201;47 to E&#8201;:&#8201;Z=18&#8201;:&#8201;82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.

         <title>A Catalytic Approach for the Synthesis of Peptide&#8722;Oligonucleotides Conjugates in Aqueous Solution or On&#8208;Column</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 39, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the preparation of peptide&#8722;oligonucleotide conjugates is presented herein. A catalytic DABCO/chlorotriazine system allowed the synthesis both on solid support in anhydrous media and in aqueous solution. More than 35 examples showcased the utility of the method with wide varieties of acid partners, peptides, and oligonucleotides, as well as an iterative process for DEL application.







Abstract
Peptide&#8722;oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs) are covalent architectures composed of a DNA or RNA molecules linked to a peptide. These constructs have found widespread applications ranging from hybrid nanomaterials to gene&#8208;targeted therapies. Considering the important role of POCs, a new catalytic approach for their preparation is reported here, that could be applied either on solid support in anhydrous media, or post&#8208;synthetically in aqueous buffer. Single amino acids, peptides and cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) were conjugated to various oligo(ribo)nucleotides with high conversions and good isolated yields. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on more than 35 examples including an analogue of a commercial therapeutic oligonucleotide. Other conjugation partners, such as deoxycholic acid and biotin were also successfully conjugated to oligonucleotides. To highlight the potential of this catalytic approach, these conditions have been applied to iterative processes, which is of high interest for the development of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries.

         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Protected cysteine and its sulfoxide pairs allow stepwise disulfide bond formation, with the reaction increasing in acidity. This system enables an unprecedented synthesis of insulin possessing three disulfides and its lipidated analog. Stepwise formation of three disulfides generally requires three independent oxidation steps; however, the presented method has a single oxidation step. More information can be found in the Research by et al. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Otaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401003).

A heavy pickup truck carries its load through a tunnel regardless of its molecular driver (H or D), thereby illustrating unexpectedly small primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects. These surprising results arise from the coupling of the tunneling H/D atoms with the N2 medium, thus highlighting a potential systematic oversight of quantum tunneling in many chemical reactions.

         <title>Macromolecular Nano&#8208;Assemblies for Enhancing the Effect of Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Photodynamic Therapy Against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the recent progress achieved by macromolecular nano&#8208;assemblies (MNAs) in addressing the challenges encountered in the oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT) against hypoxic tumors. The well&#8208;designed MNAs can relieve hypoxia, utilize hypoxia, or improve the utilization efficiency of singlet oxygen (1O2) by targeted PDT and the storage and reuse of 1O2, thereby enhancing the PDT effect.







Abstract
In oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT), photosensitizers absorb light energy, which is then transferred to ambient O2 and subsequently generates cytotoxic singlet oxygen (1O2). Therefore, the availability of O2 and the utilization efficiency of generated 1O2 are two significant factors that influence the effectiveness of PDT. However, tumor microenvironments (TMEs) characterized by hypoxia and limited utilization efficiency of 1O2 resulting from its short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance significantly restrict the applicability of PDT for hypoxic tumors. To address these challenges, numerous macromolecular nano&#8208;assemblies (MNAs) have been designed to relieve hypoxia, utilize hypoxia or enhance the utilization efficiency of 1O2. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on recent advancements achieved with MNAs in enhancing the effectiveness of O2&#8208;dependent PDT against hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Constrution of Quinazoline&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Multicomponent Reaction for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel quinazoline&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks were synthesized via a multiple&#8208;component reaction. These COFs possessed enhanced chemical stability and showed high activity for catalysing the photooxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Quinazoline (Qz)&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been constructed via a three&#8208;component reaction of ortho&#8208;acylanilines, benzaldehydes and NH4OAc. The structure of Qz&#8208;COFs has been confirmed by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. The Qz&#8208;COFs possess high chemical stability, showing good endurance to strong acid, strong base, oxidant, reductant and other conditions. Particularly, Qz&#8208;COF&#8208;3 can catalyze the aerobic photooxidation of toluene and other compounds containing C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Redox Properties of Mn(III)porphyrins in Hyaluronan Oxidative Degradation: Single Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2O2 is decomposed by para Mn(III)porphyrins, so the initiation of hyaluronan degradation is inhibited. The complexed Mn(III) ion is reduced to Mn(II) ions by H2O2, which oxidizes to oxygen. The propagation phase of hyaluronan degradation is stopped since the intermediate peroxyl&#8208;type of hyaluronan molecules are reduced to alcohol&#8208;type products, while the complexed Mn(III) ions oxidize to the oxidation state +4.







Abstract
Cationic Mn(III)&#8208;meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin derivatives, substituted in para position with different size alkyl chains, were investigated to function as antioxidants in free&#8208;radical degradation of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass hyaluronan by the methods of rotational viscometry and oximetry. The results of rotational viscometry showed that MnTM&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ showed high efficiency in decomposing H2O2, and reducing of peroxidized hyaluronan. When using oxygen electrode, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ applied to function as protective antioxidants in hyaluronan degradation, the uptake of dissolved oxygen from the reaction milieu was rapid, followed by continual increase in oxygen concentration up to the end of the measurement. However, when especially MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ were examined as hyaluronan chain&#8208;breaking antioxidants, after short&#8208;term dissolved oxygen uptake, almost no increase in oxygen concentration was shown.

However, when especially MnTE-4-PyP&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;, MnTPr-4-PyP&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;, and MnTPen-4-PyP&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; were examined as hyaluronan chain-breaking antioxidants, after short-term dissolved oxygen uptake, almost no increase in oxygen concentration was shown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Systematic Study of Nonionic Di&#8208; and Multiborane Catalysts for the Oligomerization and Polymerization of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screening of 13 different di&#8208; and multiborane polymerization catalysts is conducted, investigating the effect of factors such as linker length and linker flexibility on epoxide oligomerization and polymerization. A promising catalyst based on a biphenyl backbone is identified, which is tolerant towards excess hydroxyl groups and enables long&#8208;lived (&gt;50&#8197;days) and controlled oligomerization as well as efficient polymerization.







Abstract
Borane catalysis has emerged as a powerful technology in epoxide polymerization. Still, the structure&#8208;activity correlations for these catalysts are not fully understood to date, especially regarding compounds with nonionic backbones. Thus, in this work, 13 different borane catalysts of this respective type are described and investigated for their epoxide oligomerization and polymerization performance, using propylene oxide (PO), 1&#8208;butylene oxide (BO) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) as monomers. Structurally, special emphasis is put on catalysts with different linker lengths and linker flexibilities as well as the introduction of more than two borane functionalities. Importantly, this screening is conducted both under typical polymerization conditions as well as under the chain transfer agent (CTA)&#8208;rich conditions relevant for large&#8208;scale production. It is found that suitable preorganization of the borane groups, such as present in biphenyl derivatives, offers a simple route to high&#8208;performing catalysts and quantitative monomer conversion of the investigated epoxides. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a diborane&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization can be kept active over weeks, whereby repeated addition of monomer batches (14 steps) constantly results in full conversion and well&#8208;defined oligoethers, underlining the practical potential of this method. The absence of co&#8208;initiating counter ions is suggested as an inherent advantage of nonionic catalysts.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Kekulene Analogues: Cycloarenes with two Five&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bowl&#8208;shaped cycloarene have been synthesized via the introduction of five&#8208;membered rings into the kekulene structure. The results of DFT calculations and VT&#8208;NMR spectra indicate that inversion of concave&#8208;convex structures occurs at room temperature. Additionally, these compounds react with a dienophile to produce the vent structure compounds.







Abstract
Kekulene, a cycloarene composed of 12 fused benzene rings in a circular arrangement, exhibits a highly planar and robust structure. Kekulene has been the subject of investigation into its aromaticity and electronic structure, particularly in relation to the cyclic benzenoid. We have successfully synthesized novel bowl&#8208;shaped kekulene analogues with five&#8208;membered rings incorporated into the kekulene structure. The results of DFT calculations and VT&#8208;NMR spectra indicate that inversion of their concave&#8208;convex structures occurs at room temperature. The NICS and AICD plots predict that the Clar's type resonance structure is found in a manner analogous to the pristine kekulene, albeit with the interruption of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation on the sp3 carbons at the five&#8208;membered rings. Despite the presence of the Clar's resonance structure, the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction proceeded smoothly with a dienophile, in contrast to the behavior of planar kekulene derivatives. This study will lead to the creation of novel bowl&#8208;shaped compounds and development of reactivity in aromatic compounds.

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Structural Factors in the Luminescence Properties of Persulfurated Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work the relationship between structural and emissive properties of persulfurated benzenes is presented. The photophysical properties of this class of organic solid&#8208;state phosphorescent materials result dependent on the molecular conformations adopted in crystalline or amorphous phases.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence rarely occurs from pure organic molecules, especially in the solid&#8208;state. A strategy for the design of highly emissive organic phosphors is still hard to predict, thus impeding the development of new functional materials with the desired optical properties. Herein, we analyze a family of alkyl and aryl&#8208;substituted persulfurated benzenes, the latter representing a class of organic solid&#8208;state triplet emitters able to show very high emission quantum yield at room temperature. In this work, we correlate structural parameters with the photophysical properties observed in different experimental conditions (diluted solution, crystalline and amorphous phase at RT and low temperature). Our results, corroborated by a detailed computational analysis, indicate a close relationship between the luminescence properties and i) the nature of the substituents on the persulfurated core, ii) the adopted conformations in the solid state, both in crystalline and amorphous phases. These factors contribute to characterize the lowest&#8208;energy lying excited&#8208;state, its deactivation pathways, the phosphorescence lifetime and quantum yield. These findings provide a useful roadmap for the development of highly performing purely organic solid&#8208;state emitters based on the persulfurated benzene platform.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Tweezers&#8208;Shaped Receptor for the Biomimetic Recognition of the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal Disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal Antigen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural features of a macrocyclic receptor for axially substituted monosaccharides have been combined with those of a tweezers&#8208;shaped acylic receptor for all&#8208;equatorial disaccharides to generate a macrocyclic tweezers&#8208;like structure. The resulting structure features distinct recognition properties toward &#945;Gal and the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal antigen.







Abstract
The Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal is the terminal disaccharide unit of the &#945;&#8208;Gal epitope [Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal(&#946;1&#8208;4)GlcNAc], an exogenous antigenic determinant with several clinical implications, found in all non&#8208;primate mammals and in several dangerous pathogens, including certain protozoa and mycobacteria. Its absence in humans makes the &#945;&#8208;Gal epitope an interesting target for several infectious diseases. Here we present the development of a macrocyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor, resulting from the combination of the structural features of two predecessors belonging to the family of diaminocarbazole receptors, which exhibits binding properties in the low millimolar range toward the Gal(&#945;1&#8208;3)Gal disaccharide of the &#945;&#8208;Gal antigen.

         <title>On the Electrochemical Growth of a Crystalline p&#8211;n Junction From Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor junctions are the fundamental components of important electronic devices including transistors and photovoltaic cells. This work reports on an innovative and inexpensive method for obtaining semiconductor&#8208;based devices, particularly p&#8211;n junctions. Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition allows the sequential deposition of two different semiconductors from aqueous solutions.







Abstract
Our society largely relies on inorganic semiconductor devices which are, so far, fabricated using expensive and complex processes requiring ultra&#8208;high vacuum equipment. Here we report on the possibility of growing a p&#8211;n junction taking advantage of electrochemical processes based on the use of aqueous solutions. The growth of the junction has been carried out using the Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (E&#8208;ALD) technique, which allowed to sequentially deposit two different semiconductors, CdS and Cu2S, on an Ag(111) substrate, in a single procedure. The growth process was monitored in&#8197;situ by Surface X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (SXRD) and resulted in the fabrication of a thin double&#8208;layer structure with a high degree of crystallographic order and a well&#8208;defined interface. The high&#8208;performance electrical characteristics of the device were analysed ex&#8208;situ and show the characteristic feature of a diode.

The growth of the junction has been carried out using the Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (E-ALD) technique, which allowed to sequentially deposit two different semiconductors, CdS and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, on an Ag(111) substrate, in a single procedure. The growth process was monitored in&#8197;situ by Surface X-Ray Diffraction (SXRD) and resulted in the fabrication of a thin double-layer structure with a high degree of crystallographic order and a well-defined interface. The high-performance electrical characteristics of the device were analysed ex-situ and show the characteristic feature of a diode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cationic half&#8208;sandwich zinc complexes containing chelating amines [Cp*Zn(Ln)][BAr4F] (Cp*=&#951;3&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine; Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraethylethylenediamine,; Cp*=&#951;1&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine,; Ar4F=(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4) reacted with dihydrogen in THF to give molecular zinc hydride cations [(Ln)ZnH(thf)m][BAr4F] (m=0, 1) along with Cp*H. Pseudo first&#8208;order kinetics with zinc cation concentration suggests heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen by the Zn&#8722;Cp* bond.







Abstract
Cationic half&#8208;sandwich zinc complexes containing chelating amines [Cp*Zn(Ln)][BAr4F] (2&#8201;a, Cp*=&#951;3&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, TMEDA; 2&#8201;b, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraethylethylenediamine, TEEDA; 2&#8201;c, Cp*=&#951;1&#8208;C5Me5, Ln=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, PMDTA; Ar4F=(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4) reacted with dihydrogen (ca. 2&#8197;bar) in THF at 80&#8201;&#176;C to give molecular zinc hydride cations [(Ln)ZnH(thf)m][BAr4F] (3&#8201;a,b, m=1; 3&#8201;c, m=0) previously reported along with Cp*H. Pseudo first&#8208;order kinetics with respect to the concentration of 2&#8201;b suggests heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen by the Zn&#8722;Cp* bond, reminiscent of &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. Hydrogenolysis of the zinc cation 2&#8201;b in the presence of benzophenone gave the zinc alkoxide [(TEEDA)Zn(OCHPh2)(thf)][BAr4F] (5&#8201;b). Cation 2&#8201;b was shown to catalytically hydrogenate N&#8208;benzylideneaniline. The PMDTA complex 2&#8201;c underwent C&#8722;H bond activation in acetonitrile to give a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;&#954;C,&#954;N&#8208;cyanomethyl zinc complex [(PMDTA)Zn(CH2CN)]2[BAr4F]2 (6&#8201;c).

         <title>Conformational and Substitution Effects on the Donor and Reducing Strength of Tin(II) Porphyrinogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first study on the influence of meso&#8208;substituents on the electronic structure of a calix[4]pyrrolato complex. Expansion of NSD method from porphyrin chemistry provides insights on the ligand conformation of a calix[4]pyrrolato p&#8208;block complex. Experimental donor strength scaling methods and detailed bond analysis reveal subtle but significant substitution and conformational effects.







Abstract
Meso&#8208;octaalkylcalix[4]pyrrolates are a class of redox&#8208;active porphyrinogen ligands. They have been well established in d&#8208; and f&#8208;block chemistry for over three decades but have only recently been introduced as ligands for p&#8208;block elements. Here, we present a study on the influence of meso&#8208;substituents on the redox chemistry of calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) dianions [2R]2&#8722; (R=Me, Et). Expansion of the normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) method, well known for porphyrin chemistry, provides insights into the ligand conformation of a calix[4]pyrrolato p&#8208;block complex. Combined with the results of spectroscopic donor scaling, electrochemical studies, and quantum mechanical bond analysis tools, subtle but significant substitution and conformational effects on the electronic structure are revealed. Exploiting this knowledge rationalizes the role of this class of tin(II) dianions to act as potent reducing agents, but can also be expanded for other central elements. Photoexcitation boosts this reactivity further, allowing for the reduction of even challenging chlorobenzene.

         <title>Polycyclic Pyrazolidines by Tandem Diazomalonate Dipolar Cycloadditions and CpRu&#8208;Catalyzed Carbene Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxa/aza benzonorbornadienes and diazomalonates afford polycyclic pyrazolidines via (i) a diastereoselective [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, (ii) a CpRu&#8208;catalyzed carbene addition, and (iii) a second dipolar [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition. Step (ii) forms novel bench&#8208;stable N,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines that are effective 1,3&#8208;dipoles with electron&#8208;poor dipolarophiles. Each step proceeds efficiently and one&#8208;pot sequences are possible.







Abstract
Thanks to the ability of diazo derivatives to react either as 1,3&#8208;dipoles and as carbenes after dinitrogen extrusion, combinations of oxa or aza benzonorbornadienes and diazomalonates afford polycyclic pyrazolidines via a three&#8208;step sequence of (i) a highly diastereoselective [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, (ii) a CpRu&#8208;catalyzed carbene addition, and (iii) a second dipolar cycloaddition. Of importance, step (II) represents a unique access to novel bench&#8208;stable N,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines, which behave as effective 1,3&#8208;dipoles in combination with electron&#8208;poor dipolarophiles. Each step proceeds efficiently and the 3&#8208;step process can be performed in one&#8208;pot to yield a polycyclic pyrazolidine in excellent overall yield (90&#8201;%).

         <title>The Potential of Self&#8208;Activating Au(I) Complexes in Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifaceted approaches discussed herein highlight the tremendous potential of self&#8208;activating gold catalysis. Significant contributions have been made in the advancement of these catalysts through innovative ligand design and the discovery of novel modes of autoactivation. This knowledge holds promise for innovating organic transformations, including asymmetric catalysis, while mitigating the risk of reaction poisoning from traditional catalyst&#8208;generating additives.







Abstract
Gold catalysis has emerged as a groundbreaking field in synthetic chemistry, revolutionizing numerous organic transformations. Despite the significant achieved advancements, the mechanistic understanding behind many gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains elusive. This Concept article covers the so&#8208;called &#8220;self&#8208;activating&#8221; Au(I) complexes, sorting out their pivotal role in gold catalysis. We comment on how Au(I) complexes can undergo self&#8208;activation, triggering diverse catalytic transformations without the need for external additives. The most important examples reported so far that underlie the catalytic activity of these species are discussed. This intrinsic reactivity represents a paradigm shift in gold catalysis, offering new avenues for the design of efficient and sustainable catalytic systems. Furthermore, we explore the factors influencing the stability, reactivity, and selectivity of these Au(I) complexes, providing insights into their synthetic utility and potential applications. This area of research not only advances our fundamental understanding of gold catalysis but also paves the way for the development of novel catalytic strategies with broad implications in organic synthesis and the chemical industry.

         <title>AIE&#8208;ESIPT Photoluminescent Probe Based on 3&#8208;(3&#8208;Hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol for the Detection of Intracellular Hydrogen Peroxide</title>

3&#8208;(3&#8208;Hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol (PiQ) undergoes a distinct excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process and displays aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics in aqueous solutions. Leveraging the properties of PiQ, a photoluminescent probe, B&#8208;PiQ&#8208;A, is developed that can detect both exogenous and endogenous H2O2 in HeLa and RAW264 cells.







Abstract
Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules, which feature large Stokes shifts to avoid self&#8208;absorption, play an essential role in photoluminescent bioimaging probes. Herein, we report the development of an ESIPT molecule 3&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxypyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isoquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ol (PiQ). PiQ not only undergoes a distinct ESIPT process unlike the symmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;diol but also exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. PiQ self&#8208;assembles into aggregates with an average size of 241.0&#177;51.9&#8197;nm in aqueous solutions, leading to significantly enhanced photoluminescence. On the basis of the ESIPT and AIE characteristics of PiQ, the latter is functionalized with a hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive 4&#8208;pinacoratoborylbenzyl group (B) and a carboxylesterase&#8208;responsive acetyl group (A) to produce a photoluminescent probe B&#8722;PiQ&#8722;A. The potential of PiQ for applications in bioimaging and chemical sensing is underscored by its efficient detection of both endogenous and exogenous hydrogen peroxide in living cells.

         <title>Trans&#8208;Concerted Addition to Alkynes: the case of Ynamide Silylzincation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational investigations of mechanisms using DFT calculations for the addition of diorganosilyl&#8208;zinc reagents across the C&#8722;C triple bond of ynamides unveiled an original concerted antarafacial mechanism, compatible with the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
An original concerted antarafacial mechanism for the addition of diorganosilyl&#8208;zinc reagents across the C&#8722;C triple bond of ynamides is computationally investigated using DFT calculations. This concerted mechanism, leading to a trans&#8208;product in only one step, results in the formation of a Si&#8722;C and a Zn&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;system. We demonstrate that the mechanism going through a &#951;2&#8208;vinyl intermediate and the proposal of a radical chain pathway are energetically unsustainable. The retained concerted antarafacial pathway is tested on experimental selectivities: the regioselectivity, in favor of the silyl &#946;&#8208;addition in ynamide, and stereoselectivity, which is cis&#8208; with (Me2PhSi)2Zn but trans&#8208; with [(Me3Si)3Si]2Zn, are well reproduced by DFT calculations. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are discussed using the activation strain model and a chemical bonding analysis.

         <title>Efficient Adsorption and Elimination of Tm3+ For Enhanced Seed Germination Using Pillar[5]Arene Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for modern technology, their production methods raise concerns for agriculture. Researchers are now exploring ways to control and recycle REEs pollution, aiming to minimize agricultural impacts and potentially even develop methods to utilize these elements for improved crop yields. Regarding this issue, a new type of pillar[5]arene polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) has been designed and synthesized by click reaction to enhance the efficiency of adsorption and recovery of rare earth metals. This polymer incorporates the unique structure of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;pyridine. The results of various analyses revealed that Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent thermal stability, a high specific surface area, and well&#8208;distributed networks of micropores and mesoporous structures. The adsorption capacity of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for Tm3+, a representative REE, was evaluated using the Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal adsorption models with a maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of 127.71 mg/g. Furthermore, the versatility of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in adsorption and recovering various REEs was tested. In addition to its adsorption capabilities, the potential of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for rare earth recovery and reuse was assessed through experiments on the impact of Tm3+ and La3+ on seed germination. These experiments demonstrated the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in recovering and reusing REEs for green agriculture.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive study on the conformational behavior of diversely substituted 4&#8208;fluorotetrahydrothiopyran derivatives. Through quantum chemical simulations including DFT as well as NBO and NPA analysis, we elucidate the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions, occasionally complemented by hyperconjugative interactions, in stabilizing axial fluorine conformers. Less polar conformers were occasionally obtained, attributed to the interplay of electrostatic and hyperconjugative interactions. Experimental validation through NMR spectroscopy aligns with the computational analysis, thus providing a coherent understanding of the structural dynamics of these compounds.</dc:description>

Considering the broad reactivity of chalcogen&#8208;containing compounds, it is surprising to note that the use of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas as organic synthons remains essentially unexplored. The present contribution introduces a novel, straightforward transformation leading to azines bearing a guanidine moiety, through the reaction of a wide range of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas with commercially available diazo compounds, in the presence of triphenylphosphine. This transformation offers a new approach to such products, having biological, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis applications. The guanidine&#8208;bearing azines are obtained in excellent yields, with all manipulations taking place in air. A reaction mechanism is proposed, based on both experimental mechanistic findings and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A one&#8208;pot, multicomponent transesterification reaction between selenoureas, &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, alcohols, and triphenylphosphine was also developed, providing highly functionalized azines.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes: Halogen&#8208;Doped Anthracene as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to predict effective charge transfer (CT) in donor&#8211;acceptor (DA) co&#8208;crystals by comparing the frontier molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energies of the DA couple is presented in this study. Using PM6 and HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ methods, theoretical results were compared with experimental data from chemical and electrochemical doping. The image illustrates a vacuum evaporation set&#8208;up with iodine as the acceptor. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Fontanesi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400519).

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Ozonation Using Modified&#160;TiO2 with&#160;Designed&#160;Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic ozonation is considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants, but the design of efficient catalyst remains a challenge. Surface modification provides a potential strategy to improve the activity of photocatalytic ozonation. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were first performed to check the interaction between O3 and TiO2&#8208;OH (surface hydroxylated TiO2) or TiO2&#8208;F (surface fluorinated TiO2), and the results suggest that TiO2&#8208;OH displays better O3 adsorption and activation than does TiO2&#8208;F, which is confirmed by experimental results. The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote the O3 activation, which is beneficial for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, TiO2&#8208;OH displays better performance towards pollutants (such as berberine hydrochloride) removal than does TiO2&#8208;F and most reported ozonation photocatalysts. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency reaches 84.4% within two hours. This work highlights the effect of surface hydroxylation on photocatalytic ozonation and provides ideas for the design of efficient photocatalytic ozonation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;catalyzed Transformation of Nitrite to Nitric Oxide on Copper(II)&#8208;Cobalt(II) Centers in a Bimetallic Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrite (NO2&#8211;) serves as a pool of nitric oxide (NO) in biological systems under hypoxic conditions, and it is transformed to NO by nitrite reductase (NiR) enzyme in the presence of acid.&#160;However, NO synthases generate NO&#160;in normoxic conditions. Previously, acid&#8208;induced NO2&#8211; reduction chemistry was modeled on mono&#8208;metallic 3d&#8208;metals, generating metal&#8208;nitrosyls or NO(g) with H2O or H2O2 products. Herein, to understand the relative potency of a bimetallic system, we report the acid&#8208;induced reductive conversion of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8211; to NO on CuII&#8208;CoII centers of a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8209;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8209;NO2&#8722;&#8209;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722;&#8208;CoII, 2) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H). The CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722;&#8208;CoII generates [CuII(LN8H)CoII]4+ (1) upon reaction with one equiv. acid (HClO4, H+ ions source) with NO(g) via a presumed transient nitrousacid (ONOH) intermediate species. Likewise, this NO2&#8722; reduction was found to form H2O, which is believed to be from the decomposition of H2O2, an intermediate species. In addition, complex 2, in the presence of more than one equiv. H+ ions also showed the formation of NO(g) with H2O. Mechanistic investigations, using 15N&#8208;labeled&#8208;15NO2&#8211;, 18O&#8208;labeled&#8208;18O14N16O&#8211; and 2H&#8208;labeled&#8208;DClO4 (D+ source), revealed that the N&#8208;atom and O&#8208;atom in the 14/15NO and 14N18O gases are derived from NO2&#8211; ligand and H&#8208;atom in H2O derived from H+&#8208;source, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Multi&#8208;Chromophoric Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of multi&#8208;chromophoric systems can provide highly ordered materials with distinct optoelectronic properties. Self&#8208;assembled materials through crystal, liquid crystal and supramolecular polymer formation of various multi&#8208;chromophoric systems have been reported. In this review, we focus on different molecular design strategies adopted till date to fabricate self&#8208;assembled materials with distinct optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of chromophoric systems is a prerequisite to create well&#8208;ordered, processable nanomaterials with multiple functionalities. In the past two decades, the field of functional organic materials has primarily focused on systems featuring only one type of dye/&#960;&#8208;conjugated unit. Consequently, many reports with mechanistic insights on the self&#8208;assembly of the dyes featuring different molecular packing have been reported. Subsequently, we have witnessed several attempts to organize the multi&#8208;chromophoric systems in solution and solid&#8208;state via different approaches using self&#8208;assembly as a tool. Incorporation of more than one dye is important in creating materials with tuneable optoelectronic properties. Consequently, self&#8208;assembly of more than one chromophoric systems have been investigated to some extent. This review aims to discuss the self&#8208;assembled materials derived from discrete &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems comprising more than one dye units connected through covalent bonding (multi&#8208;chromophoric systems). Molecular design of various multi&#8208;chromophoric systems leading to the formation of crystals, liquid crystals and supramolecular polymers have been correlated with corresponding properties. We envisage that classification of self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;chromophoric systems, with a note on tuneable optoelectronic properties, can provide a deeper understanding on the molecular design strategies, which is important in the fabrication of functional organic materials with optimum performances.

         <title>Porphyrin Atropisomerism as a Molecular Engineering Tool in Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Recognition, Supramolecular Assembly, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin atropisomerism opens an entirely new toolbox, allowing for the precise design of a porphyrin's molecular shape. This review details how this phenomenon has been utilised across all fields of chemistry, focusing on molecular recognition, medicinal chemistry and catalysis.







Abstract
Porphyrin atropisomerism, which arises from restricted &#963;&#8208;bond rotation between the macrocycle and a sufficiently bulky substituent, was identified in 1969 by Gottwald and Ullman in 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)porphyrins. Henceforth, an entirely new field has emerged utilizing this transformative tool. This review strives to explain the consequences of atropisomerism in porphyrins, the methods which have been developed for their separation and analysis and present the diverse array of applications. Porphyrins alone possess intriguing properties and a structure which can be easily decorated and molded for a specific function. Therefore, atropisomerism serves as a transformative tool, making it possible to obtain even a specific molecular shape. Atropisomerism has been thoroughly exploited in catalysis and molecular recognition yet presents both challenges and opportunities in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Characterization of Germanium Nanoparticles from Arylgermanium Trihydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
o&#8208;tolylgermanium trihydride undergoes dehydrogenative coupling to form a germanium nanoparticle with o&#8208;tolyl termination. The particles are about 2&#8211;6&#8197;nm in size and have intense orange to red coloration.







Abstract
Germanium is a promising basis for nanomaterials due to its low toxicity and valuable optical and electronic properties. However, germanium nanomaterials have seen little research compared to other group 14 elements due to unpredictable chemical behavior and high costs. Here, we report the dehydrocoupling of o&#8208;tolylgermanium trihydride to amorphous nanoparticles. The reaction is facilitated through reflux at 162&#8201;&#176;C and can be accelerated with an amine base catalyst. Through cleavage of both H2 and toluene, new Ge&#8722;Ge bonds form. This results in nanoparticles consisting of crosslinked germanium with o&#8208;tolyl termination. The particles are 2&#8211;6&#8197;nm in size and have masses above approximately 3500&#8197;Da. The organic substituents are promising for further functionalization. Combined with strong absorption up to 600&#8197;nm and moderate solubility and air stability, there are numerous possibilities for future applications.

         <title>Phase Transition Control in Molecular Solids via Complementarity of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we highlight a phase transition driven by H&#8208;bond strength complementarity &#8211; pairing strong acceptor with weak donor and vice versa, which offers a straightforward and effective approach for designing phase&#8208;transition molecular solids from a chemical perspective.







Abstract
Phase transitions in molecular solids involve synergistic changes in chemical and electronic structures, leading to diversification in physical and chemical properties. Despite the pivotal role of hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in many phase&#8208;transition materials, it is rare and challenging to chemically regulate the dynamics and to elucidate the structure&#8208;property relationship. Here, four high&#8208;spin CoII compounds were isolated and systematically investigated by modifying the ligand terminal groups (X=S, Se) and substituents (Y=Cl, Br). S&#8722;Cl and Se&#8722;Br undergo a reversible structural phase transition near room temperature, triggering the rotation of 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 guests and the swing between syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation of NCX&#8722; ligands, accompanied by switchable magnetism. Conversely, S&#8722;Br and Se&#8722;Cl retain stability in ordered and disordered phases, respectively. H&#8208;bonds geometric analysis and ab initio calculations reveal that the electronegativity of X and Y affects the strength of NY&#8208;ap&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. Entropy&#8208;driven structural phase transitions occur when the H&#8208;bond strength is appropriate; otherwise, the phase stays unchanged if it is too strong or weak. This work highlights a phase transition driven by H&#8208;bond strength complementarity &#8211; pairing strong acceptor with weak donor and vice versa, which offers a straightforward and effective approach for designing phase&#8208;transition molecular solids from a chemical perspective.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition is a universal and straightforward pathway for carbocyclic or heterocyclic organic compounds. In this article, we highlight the most recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of alkynes with focus on the reaction mechanism and the late&#8208;stage synthetic applications. Advances in obtaining cyclobutenes, azetines, and oxetene intermediates continue to be breakthroughs in this fascinating field of research.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction can be considered an ideal solution due to its green and sustainable properties, and is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize four&#8208;membered ring motifs. Although research on the [2+2] photocycloaddition of alkynes is challenging because of the diminished reactivity of alkynes, and the more significant ring strain of the products, remarkable achievements have been made in this field. In this article, we highlight the recent advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of alkynes, with focus on the reaction mechanism and the late&#8208;stage synthetic applications. Advances in obtaining cyclobutenes, azetines, and oxetene active intermediates continue to be breakthroughs in this fascinating field of research.

         <title>Enhanced Co&#8208;Adsorption of Alcohols and Amines for Visible Light Driven Oxidative Condensation Using Iron&#8208;Based MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced co&#8208;adsorption of aromatic alcohols and amines for efficient synthesis of imines under visible irradiation using iron&#8208;based MOF is reported. The co&#8208;adsorption takes place on metal nodes and linker sites separately without influencing the activation of molecular oxygen, thus presenting a high efficiency under mild conditions.







Abstract
Imines are essential intermediates in organic transformations, and is generally produced by dehydrogenative condensation of alcohols and amines with the assist of specialized catalysts and additives. Heterogeneous photocatalysis provides a sustainable platform for such process without the using of toxic oxidants, yet a functionalized photocatalyst with optimized co&#8208;adsorption of reactants needs to be developed to promote the stoichiometric oxidative condensation under ambient conditions. Here, we show that benzyl alcohol and aniline adsorb non&#8208;interferingly on the Fe node and the linker sites of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) metal organic frameworks (MOFs), respectively. The co&#8208;adsorption of both reactants barely influences the reduction of molecular oxygen to generate oxygen radicals, resulting in efficient formation of benzaldehyde under visible light. Additionally, the weak adsorption of water together with surface acidity of the MIL&#8208;53(Fe) promote a rapid condensation of benzaldehyde with aniline and the depletion of generated water, achieving an efficient C&#8722;N bond creation for a wide range of substrates.

         <title>Opportunity of Patterning in Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformative potential of patterning expands the applications of materials in chemistry. A fluorescent self&#8208;assembled monolayer is used to create an optical 2D barcode encoding digital information. This technology facilitates optical data storage and serves as a versatile platform for diverse applications. For instance, when objects such as cell cultures are deposited onto the barcode, leveraging advanced error&#8208;handling mechanisms during code reading enables real&#8208;time monitoring of various parameters, including cell count, spatial distribution, and transfection efficiency. This visual encapsulates the intersection of chemistry, materials science, and biotechnology, showcasing the boundless possibilities offered by patterning. More information can be found in the Concept Article by D. Gentili and M. Cavallini (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401219).

         <title>Unexpectedly regioselective Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of new unsymmetrical benzoquinones: A convenient synthetic entry to uniquely substituted decalins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report flexible synthesis of new unsymmetrically 2,6&#8208;disubstituted benzoquinones (33 examples) and a systematic study of their reactivity in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. The Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of selected unsymmetrical benzoquinones with seemingly similar substituents were found to proceed with high regioselectivity and the formation of selected experimentally observed main products was rationalized by theoretical (DFT) calculations. The findings can be exploited in the convenient preparation of densely substituted and stereochemically defined decalins with unique angular substituents at ring fusion. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology in complex molecule synthesis through the total synthesis of a novel forskolin analog possessing an ethyl group at the fusion of the rings B and C.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Brightness Heterogeneity in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles (NPs), including perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with single photon purity, present challenges in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies due to their distinct photoluminescence (PL) behaviors. In particular, the zero&#8208;time correlation amplitude [g2(0)] and the associated diffusion timescale (&#964;D) of their FCS curves show substantial dependency on pump intensity (IP). Optical saturation inadequately explains the origin of this FCS phenomenon in NPs, thus setting them apart from conventional dye molecules, which do not manifest such behavior. This observation is apparently attributed to either photo&#8208;brightening or optical trapping, both lead to increased NP occupancy (N) in the excitation volume, consequently reducing the g2(0) amplitude [since g2(0) &#945; 1/N] at high IP. However, an advanced FCS study utilizing alternating laser excitation at two different intensities dismisses such possibilities. Further investigation into single&#8208;particle blinking behaviors as a function of IP reveals that the intensity dependence of g2(0) primarily arises from the brightness heterogeneity prevalent in almost all types of NPs. This report delves into the complexities of the photophysical properties of NPs and their adverse impacts on FCS studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Gene Editing with Artificial DNA Scissors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as DNA molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic with high clinical potential. This review provides a primary level of exploration on the concepts key to this area including an introduction to DNA structure, function, recognition, along with damage and repair mechanisms. Building on this foundation, we describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide molecular scissors with enhanced or sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities. As this research field continues to evolve, understanding the applications of AMNs along with synthetic conjugation strategies can provide the basis for future innovations, particularly for designing new artificial gene editing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Interconversion of p&#8208;Tolylsulfone&#8208;Functionalized Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane Couples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of library of new 2,3&#8208;disubstituted norbornadiene/quadricyclane couples. For the first time, the para&#8208;tolylsulfone moiety was employed as electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent in combination with a variety of different electron donors as counterparts. Comprehensive characterization was conducted for every interconversion couple. By comparison with structurally related molecules published previously we established the tosyl moiety as suitable alternative to previously investigated ester functionalities by providing similar photophysical properties. The photo&#8208;induced interconversion behavior was investigated via UV/Vis&#8208; and NMR&#8208;spectroscopy. The UV/Vis experiments were carried out exclusively in acetonitrile, whereas several solvents were investigated in the NMR studies. A detailed description and comparison of the isomerization behavior is provided, while examining relevant optical properties like &#955;max and &#955;onset. Thereby, an enhanced red&#8208;shift up to &#955;max = 394 nm combined with an &#955;onset value of 469 nm could be generated which is necessary for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling and understanding charge state and metal coordination in carbon nanomaterials is crucial to harnessing their unique properties. Here we describe the synthesis of the well&#8208;defined fulleride complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}6C70], 2, (Mesnacnac) = HC(MeCNMes)2, Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, from the reaction of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate magnesium(I) complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}2] with C70 in aromatic solvents. The molecular structure of complex 2 was determined, providing the first high&#8208;quality structural study of a complex with the C706&#8208; ion. In combination with solution state NMR spectroscopic and DFT computational studies, the changes in geometry and charge distribution in the various atom and bond types of the fulleride unit were investigated. Additionally, the influence of the (Mesnacnac)Mg+ cations on the global and local fulleride coordination environment was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzoic Acid Serves as Precursor of Catalytic HAT Reagent in a Two&#8208;Molecule Photoredox System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoinduced regioselective HAT reactions of acetals, ethers, and alcohols using benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system led to the formation of new C&#8211;C bonds with alkenes under mild conditions. Aryl carboxy radicals generated from benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system can function as catalytic HAT reagents, even though an excess amount of a hydrogen donor substrate is required. Various acetals, ethers, alcohols, and alkenes can be employed in the photoreaction to provide both high yields of adducts and high recoveries of benzoic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Electrochemical Peptide Synthesis Enabled by Electron&#8208;Rich Triaryl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While remarkable progress has been made in the development of peptide medicines, many problems related to peptide synthesis remain unresolved. Previously, we reported electrochemical peptide synthesis using a phosphine as a potentially recyclable coupling reagent. However, there was room for improvement from the point of view of reaction efficiency, especially in the carboxylic acid activation step and the peptide bond formation step. To overcome these challenges, we searched for the optimal phosphine. Among phosphines with various electronic properties, we found that electron&#8208;rich triaryl phosphines improved the reaction efficiency. Consequently, we successfully performed electrochemical peptide synthesis on sterically hindered and valuable amino acids. We also synthesized oligopeptides that were challenging with our previous method. Finally, we examined the effect of substituents on the phosphine cations, and gained some insights into reactivity, which will aid researchers designing reactions involving phosphine cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of High Performance Energetic Biocidal Bicyclic Compounds Derivated from Iodopyrazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modular synthesis can combine different functional module to flexibly regulate comprehensive properties and study the diversity of compounds. This study established a modular bicyclic synthesis strategy of combining polynitro energetic module with iodine&#8208;containing biocidal module. Compounds 1&#8208;6 with high iodine content (48.72&#8208;69.56%) and high thermal stability (Td: 172&#8208;304 &#730;C) were synthesized and exhaustively identified. By modular synthesis, the detonation properties and gas&#8208;production of 3&#8208;6 improved greatly expanding their biocidal efficacy and maintained the iodine atomic utilization of iodine&#8208;containing module. Notably, 4,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4',5'&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3'&#8208;bipyrazole (5) and 3,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;4,4',5'&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3'&#8208;bipyrazole (6) exhibit high detonation velocities (D: 5903 m s&#8208;1, 5769 m s&#8208;1, respectively) and highest gas production of 212.85 L mol&#8208;1 and 217.66 L mol&#8208;1 after decomposition. This study diversifies polyiodio&#8208;nitro compounds, and also inspire the implementation of similar synthesis strategies to provide family&#8208;level synthetic solutions to energetic biocidal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Realization of Visual and Contact&#8208;Type Fast Charging Power Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charging power supplies with both fast and visualization functions have a wide range of applications in the information and new energy industries. In this paper, the visualized and contact&#8208;type fast charging power supply based on WO3 film and Zn sheet is presented, and the prototype devices are fabricated. Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3. Theoretical investigation indicates that the interaction between Zn sheet and water molecules is the primary cause of the color change in the WO3 film. The WO3 film completes the colouring state within 10 s in the presence of Zn sheet and water, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7 V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection. This research introduces a novel method to induce colouring of WO3 films and proposes a fast charging mode different from traditional power sources. It provides valuable insights for the future development of fast charging in the field of electrical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Guerbet Reaction by Metal Ligand Cooperation Catalyst Mn&#8208;PCP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT study provides insights into the mechanism of Guerbet reaction by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation catalyst Mn&#8208;PCP. The selectivity and the electronic effect of the carbanion PCP ligand on the Guerbet reaction were elucidated.







Abstract
The Guerbet reaction is important for the synthesis of longer&#8208;chain monoalcohols like isobutanol through catalytic transfer hydrogenation from short&#8208;chain methanol and ethanol. However, the mechanism becomes complicated, especially considering the variations in the different metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) catalysts used. In order to further understand the Guerbet reaction, DFT studies were performed to figure out the detailed mechanism initiated by the unique Mn&#8208;PCP MLC Catalyst. Our results suggest that even with the assistance of the carbanion site of the PCP ligand, the direct substitution mechanism is less favored than the condensation&#8208;reduction mechanism. The key step of the reaction is the final reduction of the carbonyl, in which the 1,4&#8208;reduction of the unsaturated aldehyde is prior to the 3,4&#8208;reduction or 1,2&#8208;reduction due to the stronger interaction between the catalyst and the substrate. It is found that the production of isobutanol is preferred over n&#8208;butanol because of the lower total free energy barrier and lower relative free energy of the product. Finally, by changing the electronic effect of the carbanion site of the catalyst, we found that the relation between the electronic effect and the highest free energy span was not monotonous and a point with optimal electronic effect exists numerically.

         <title>Identification of Potential Drug Targets of Calix[4]arene by Reverse Docking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational approach, was applied to design protein inhibitors using the calix[4]arene as molecular scaffold. By screening a database of druggable proteins with a reverse docking procedure, we identified and discussed many proteins of pharmaceutical interest.







Abstract
Calixarenes are displaying great potential for the development of new drug delivery systems, diagnostic imaging, biosensing devices and inhibitors of biological processes. In particular, calixarene derivatives are able to interact with many different enzymes and function as inhibitors. By screening of the potential drug target database (PDTD) with a reverse docking procedure, we identify and discuss a selection of 100 proteins that interact strongly with calix[4]arene. We also discover that leucine (23.5&#8201;%), isoleucine (11.3&#8201;%), phenylalanines (11.3&#8201;%) and valine (9.5&#8201;%) are the most frequent binding residues followed by hydrophobic cysteines and methionines and aromatic histidines, tyrosines and tryptophanes. Top binders are peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptors that already are targeted by commercial drugs, demonstrating the practical interest in calix[4]arene. Nuclear receptors, potassium channel, several carrier proteins, a variety of cancer&#8208;related proteins and viral proteins are prominent in the list. It is concluded that calix[4]arene, which is characterized by facile access, well&#8208;defined conformational characteristics, and ease of functionalization at both the lower and higher rims, could be a potential lead compound for the development of enzyme inhibitors and theranostic platforms.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides and Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of natural products and analogs: A unified strategy! This study delineates the synthesis of Ecklonialactone A, B, C, D, and Eiseniachlorides A and B, as well as ent&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 12,13&#8208;diepi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, and 12&#8208;chloro&#8208;Eiseniachloride B through a unified and convergent approach.







Abstract
Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides, and Egregiachlorides are synthesized in living organisms via the lipoxygenase&#8208;mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Originally isolated and identified from brown seaweed (Ecklonia stolonifera, Eisenia bicyclis, and Egregia menziesii), and later replicated on milligram scale through chemical synthesis, the full biological activities of these compounds remain to be elucidated. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we propose a unified methodology to synthesize the 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic structures of Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides and analogs using a versatile and convergent approach. This study delineates the synthesis of Ecklonialactone A, B, C, D, and Eiseniachlorides A and B, as well as ent&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B and 12,13&#8208;diepi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B.

This study delineates the synthesis of Ecklonialactone A, B, C, D, and Eiseniachlorides A and B, as well as &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;-Ecklonialactone B, 16-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-Ecklonialactone B and 12,13-di&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-Ecklonialactone B.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrophilic Behavior of the &#8220;Nucleophilic&#8221; Pyramidane: Reactivity of Ge&#8208;Pyramidane towards Organolithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of Ge&#8208;pyramidane with tBuLi produces an unusual organogermanium compound featuring a Ge&#8722;Li bond and additional &#951;3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;coordination of lithium cation to C3&#8208;allylic moiety of the carbon base, as the product of the formal insertion of a Ge&#8208;apex into the C&#8722;Li bond of tBuLi, thus portraying unique electrophilic behavior of a pyramidane.







Abstract
The particular reactivity of the recently discovered class of the main group element polyhedral clusters, pyramidanes, remains largely unexplored. In this communication, we report the reaction of the germapyramidane with tert&#8208;butyllithium leading to the rather unusual organogermanium compound [Li+(thf)2]&#8901;2&#8722;, as the product of the formal insertion of a Ge&#8208;apex into the C&#8722;Li bond. This reactivity mode exemplifies unusual electrophilic behaviour of a pyramidane, which is a priori considered as a nucleophilic reagent. Being highly reactive, [Li+(thf)2]&#8901;2&#8722; readily undergoes reactions with electrophiles (MeI, EtBr), initially forming intermediate germahousenes, which isomerize to the thermodynamically more favourable germoles.

         <title>Migration of Condensed Aromatic Hydrocarbons During Alkyne&#8208;Vinylidene Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkyne&#8208;vinylidene rearrangement was applied on internal alkynes featuring sterically demanding condensed aromatics, such as phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and ferrocene, reaching yields of up to 99&#8201;% of the resulting vinylidene complexes. Buried Volume analysis showed that the number of flanking hydrogens rather than electronic properties impact the performance of the substrates.







Abstract
Diarylacetylenes ArC&#8801;CAr featuring condensed aromatic hydrocarbon fragments (Ar) such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene were converted into vinylidene ligands by 1,2&#8208;migration reactions within the coordination sphere of half&#8208;sandwich complexes [MII(dppe)Cp]+ (MII = RuII, FeII). Comparison of the extent of conversion of the alkyne substrates to the vinylidene complexes [Ru{=C=CAr2}(dppe)Cp]+ with those obtained from acetylenes functionalized by smaller groups (H, CH3, Ph) show that the molecular volume (VM) of the migrating group and relief of steric congestion plays a role during the rearrangement process. Conversely, the H&#8208;atoms from the larger condensed ring aryl groups that are in close proximity to the migrating sites also have a significant influence on the efficacy and extent of the reaction by restricting access of the alkyne to the metal center, resulting in a less effective migration reaction. This combination of competing steric factors (acceleration due to relief of steric congestion and restricted access of the alkyne moiety to the reaction site) is exemplified by the facile migration of 1&#8208;pyryl entities and the low yields of vinylidene products formed from 1,2&#8208;bis(9&#8208;anthryl)acetylene.

         <title>Postsynthetic Modification of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks can be finely tailored to achieve specific properties through postsynthetic modification. Three approaches in terms of postsynthetic modification of the building blocks, the guests, and the connection modes between the building blocks were highlighted, which exert a profound influence on the framework structures and subsequently induce alterations in flexibility, luminescence, electrochemistry, and chirality.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks have garnered significant attention due to their flexible structures with tailored porosity, making them a promising class of porous framework materials. However, the direct synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with specific functions is highly challenging due to the unpredictable formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks. In response, postsynthetic modification has emerged as a potent strategy to imbue desired functions into hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks. Recent advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of postsynthetic modification in hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for studying their mechanical, luminescent, electrochemical, and chiral properties. In this concept, we comprehensively summarize the methodologies and outcomes of postsynthetic modification to hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, providing a highlight of this exciting research area.

         <title>Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation Reactions: Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Activation of N&#8208;Halosuccinimides and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chalcogen bond (ChB) involving the tellurium atom of CF3&#8208;functionalized triaryltelluronium salt and the carbonyl oxygen of N&#8208;chloro&#8208;, N&#8208;bromo&#8208; and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NCS, NBS and NIS) was evidenced in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by 125Te NMR. This ChB was strong enough in solution to allow catalytic halogenation reactions to occur at room temperature and even at 0&#8201;&#176;C with activated substrates.







Abstract
The ability of triaryltelluronium salts to interact with N&#8208;halosuccinimides (NXS) through chalcogen bonding (ChB) in the solid state and in solution is demonstrated herein. Cocrystals of the triaryltelluronium bearing two CF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups per aryl ring with N&#8208;chloro&#8208;, N&#8208;bromo&#8208; and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (respectively NCS, NBS and NIS) were analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, evidencing a ChB between tellurium and the carbonyl group of NXS. This ChB was confirmed in solution by NMR spectroscopy, especially by 125Te NMR titration experiment, which allowed the determination of the association constant (Ka) between the telluronium and NBS. The so&#8208;obtained Ka value of 17.3&#177;0.6&#8197;M&#8722;1 indicated a moderate interaction in solution because of the competitive role of the solvent. The strength of the Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O ChB was however sufficient enough to promote the catalytic halofunctionalization of aromatics and of alkenes such as the intra&#8208; and intermolecular haloalkoxylation and haloesterification of alkenes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Decarboxylative Allylation of Oxime Esters under Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and general photocatalyzed allylation reaction has been established. This transformation that uses simple allyl bromides and oxime esters derived from commercially available and pharmaceutically relevant carboxylic acids, gives access to a wide array of allylic compounds that can be further employed in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Allylation reactions, often used as a key step for constructing complex molecules and drug candidates, typically rely on transition&#8208;metal (TM) catalysts. Even though TM&#8208;free radical allylations have been developed using allyl&#8208;stannanes, &#8208;sulfides, &#8208;silanes or &#8208;sulfones, much less procedures have been reported using simple and commercially available allyl halides, that are used for the preparation of the before&#8208;mentioned allyl derivatives. Here, we present a straightforward photocatalytic protocol for the decarboxylative allylation of oxime esters using allyl bromide derivatives under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. This methodology yields a diverse variety of functionalized molecules including several pharmaceutically relevant molecules.

     alt="Metal-Free Decarboxylative Allylation of Oxime Esters under Light Irradiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective and general photocatalyzed allylation reaction has been established. This transformation that uses simple allyl bromides and oxime esters derived from commercially available and pharmaceutically relevant carboxylic acids, gives access to a wide array of allylic compounds that can be further employed in organic synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allylation reactions, often used as a key step for constructing complex molecules and drug candidates, typically rely on transition-metal (TM) catalysts. Even though TM-free radical allylations have been developed using allyl-stannanes, -sulfides, -silanes or -sulfones, much less procedures have been reported using simple and commercially available allyl halides, that are used for the preparation of the before-mentioned allyl derivatives. Here, we present a straightforward photocatalytic protocol for the decarboxylative allylation of oxime esters using allyl bromide derivatives under metal-free and mild conditions. This methodology yields a diverse variety of functionalized molecules including several pharmaceutically relevant molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical C&#8208;Glycosylation Using Photoexcitable Unprotected Glycosyl Borate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed radical C&#8208;glycosylation using photoexcitable unprotected glycosyl borate.&#160;The direct excitation of glycosyl borate under&#160;visible light irradiation&#160;enabled the generation of anomeric radical without any photoredox catalysts.&#160;The in situ generated anomeric radical was applicable to the radical addition such as Giese&#8208;type addition and Minisci&#8208;type reaction to introduce alkyl and heteroaryl groups at the anomeric position. In addition, the radical&#8211;radical coupling between the glycosyl borate and acyl imidazolide provided unprotected acyl C&#8208;glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Approach to Construct Novel&#160;Polyesters as Soft Midblock for Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative synthetic strategies to create functional polycaprolactones is highly demanded for advanced material applications. In this contribution, we reported a facile synthetic strategy to prepare a class of CL&#8208;based monomers (R&#8208;TO) derived from epoxides. They readily polymerize via well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of polyesters P(R&#8208;TO) with high molecular weight (Mn up to 350 kDa). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition&#8208;dependent mechanical properties. Notably, P(L&#8208;LA)100&#8208;b&#8208;P(MTO)500&#8208;b&#8208;P(L&#8208;LA)100 containing the amorphous P(MTO) segment as a soft midblock and crystalline P(L&#8208;LA) domain as hard end block behaved as an excellent thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) with high elongation at break (1438 &#177; 204%), tensile strength (23.5 &#177; 1.7&#8201;MPa), and outstanding elastic recovery (&gt;88%).</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Mechanism of Triboluminescence: Insights from Structural and Electrostatic Characterization of Copper Thiocyanate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated through mechanical stress; it has emerging applications in stress&#8208;sensing devices. Although the prevailing mechanistic model indicates that light emits from charge separation and recombination in fracture planes arising from polar structures, its application in designing triboluminescent materials remains limited owing to numerous exceptions. This study provides insights into the essential requirements for triboluminescence by investigating the structural and electrostatic properties of fractured crystals of copper thiocyanate complexes. The examined fracture plane indicated that charge pairs (which are essential for light emission) form when intermolecular interactions are disrupted during fracturing. On the basis of the nature of these charges, we successfully suppressed triboluminescence by inhibiting the formation of intermolecular interactions disrupted in the examined complexes. Furthermore, we induced its re&#8208;emergence by creating an alternative fracture plane through controlled manipulation of the molecular network. This demonstrative deactivation and reactivation of triboluminescence underscores the critical role of intermolecular disruption in generating charge pairs, a prerequisite for triboluminescence.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of mild, robust and metal&#8208;free catalytic approach for the hydrosilylation of alkenes is critical to the advancement of modern organosilicon chemistry given their powerful capacity in the construction of various C&#8208;Si bonds. Herein, we wish to disclose a visible light&#8208;triggered organophotocatalytic strategy, which proceeds via a triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;enabled radical chain pathway. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral protocol is capable of accommodating a broad spectrum of electron&#8208;deficient and &#8208;rich alkenes with excellent functional group compatibility. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are more reactive and the reaction could be finished within a couple of minutes even in PBS solution with extremely low concentration, which suggests its click&#8208;like potential in organic synthesis. The preparative power of the transformations has been further highlighted in a number of complex settings, including the late&#8208;stage functionalization and scale&#8208;up experiments. Furthermore, although only highly reactive (TMS)3SiH is suitable hydrosilane substrate, our studies revealed the great reactivity and versatility of (TMS)3Si&#8208; group in diverse C&#8208;Si and Si&#8208;Si bond cleavage&#8208;based transformations, enabling the rapid introduction of diverse functional groups and the facile construction of valuable quaternary silicon architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed Mannosylerythritol Lipid Analogues Exhibiting Both Selective Cytotoxicity Against Human Skin Cancer Cells and Recovery Effects on Damaged Skin Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of four kinds of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) analogues R&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2R,3S]&#8208;erythritol type), S&#8208;mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)&#8208;A ([2S,3S]&#8208;threitol type), R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A ([2R,3R]&#8208;threitol type), and &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2S,3R]&#8208;erythritol type) and their selective cytotoxicity against HSC&#8208;5 cancer cells. The results indicate that R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals exhibiting both cancer cell&#8208;selective toxicity and recovery effects on damaged skin cells.







Abstract
Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are a class of amphipathic molecules bearing a hydrophilic 4&#8208;O&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol skeleton. Here, we designed and synthesized four kinds of MEL analogues R&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2R,3S]&#8208;erythritol type), S&#8208;mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)&#8208;A ([2S,3S]&#8208;threitol type), R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A ([2R,3R]&#8208;threitol type), and &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;MEL&#8722;A ([2S,3R]&#8208;erythritol type) using our previously reported boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) method and a neighboring group assisted glycosylation method. The selective cytotoxicity of the target compounds against cancer cells was evaluated, with R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A showing the highest selective cytotoxicity against human skin squamous carcinoma HSC&#8208;5 cells. Our findings suggest that R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A induces necrosis&#8208;like cell death against HSC&#8208;5 cells by decreasing cell membrane fluidity. R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A also exhibits an efficient recovery effect on damaged skin cells, indicating that R&#8208;MTL&#8722;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals with both cancer cell&#8208;selective toxicity and recovery effects on damaged skin cells.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of four kinds of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) analogues &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MEL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;]-erythritol type), &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-mannosylthreitol lipid (MTL)-A ([2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;]-threitol type), &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]-threitol type), and &#945;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MEL&#8722;A ([2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]-erythritol type) and their selective cytotoxicity against HSC-5 cancer cells. The results indicate that &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-MTL&#8722;A has potential as a lead compound for new cosmeceuticals exhibiting both cancer cell-selective toxicity and recovery effects on damaged skin cells.

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Gallium Sulfides and Selenides Supported by a Bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallylene supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide (Boxm) ligand was synthesized and structurally characterized. The reaction of this gallylene with triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide yielded dimeric gallium sulfide and selenide. These compounds could be converted to monomeric terminal sulfide and selenide by coordination of an external Lewis base such as an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC or IMe4) and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridiene (DMAP). These doubly&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide reacted with phenyl isocyanate to give the corresponding cycloadducts by releasing the Lewis base, indicating the formation of a single&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide intermediate.

         <title>O/S Exchange Reaction in Synthesizing Sulfur&#8208;Containing Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copolymerization of epoxides with carbon disulfide (CS2) or carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a facile and versatile method to produce sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with distinctive properties and functions. Of special, the copolymerization invariably exhibits the intensely complicated chemistry of O/S exchange reaction, leading to the functional sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with diverse architectures.







Abstract
Using carbon disulfide (CS2) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) as sulfur&#8208;containing and one&#8208;carbon feedstocks to make value&#8208;added products is paramount for both pure and applied chemistry and environmental science. One of the practical strategies is to copolymerize these bulk chemicals with epoxides to produce sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. This approach contributes to improving the sustainability of polymer manufacturing, provides highly desired functional polymer materials, and has attracted much attention. However, these copolymerizations invariably exhibit the intensely complicated chemistry of O/S exchange reaction, leading to sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with diverse architectures. As the understanding of O/S exchange continues to deepen, recent efforts have guided significant advances in the synthesis of CS2&#8208; and COS&#8208;based polymers. This review examines the O/S exchange chemistry and summarizes the recent progress in this field to promote the further advance of synthesizing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers from CS2 and COS.

         <title>&#8216;Passivated Precursor&#8217; Approach to All&#8208;Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters and Total Structure Determination of Au130</title>

         <dc:description>
We present here a &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach for all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters, which consists of direct reduction and chromatography separation, and gives a series of clusters including Au22, Au36, Au44, Au130 and Au144. Notably, the overall yields are 40&#8201;%. In addition, total structure determination of Au130 has been achieved.







Abstract
A &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach is developed for the efficient synthesis and isolation of all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters. Direct reduction of dpa&#8208;passivated precursor Au&#8208;dpa (Hdpa=2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridylamine) in one&#8208;pot under ambient conditions gives a series of clusters including Au22(C&#8801;CR)18 (R=&#8722;C6H4&#8722;2&#8722;F), Au36(C&#8801;CR)24, Au44(C&#8801;CR)28, Au130(C&#8801;CR)50, and Au144(C&#8801;CR)60. These clusters can be well separated via column chromatography. The overall isolation yield of this series of clusters is 40&#8201;% (based on gold), which is much improved in comparison with previous approaches. It is notable that the molecular structure of the giant cluster Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 is revealed, which presents important information for understanding the structure of the mysterious Au130 nanoclusters. Theoretical calculations indicated Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 has a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap than Au130(S&#8722;C6H4&#8722;4&#8722;CH3)50. This facile and reliable synthetic approach will greatly accelerate further studies on all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters.

         <title>Modulation of Intermolecular Interactions in Organic Emitters for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective luminescence of aggregates demonstrates excellent photophysical properties that are distinct from the &#8220;isolated&#8221; monomer and offers feasible solution for aggregated&#8208;caused quenching problem, which facilitates realizing outstanding electroluminescent performance. Here, highly efficient OLEDs based on aggregated emitters with different luminescent mechanisms achieved through intermolecular interactions modulation are highlighted.







Abstract
The adverse aggregated&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem of most electroluminescent materials existing in highly doped thin films is one of the key factors impeding the commercialization of high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) panel. Whereas, by delicately constructing and modulating moderate intermolecular interactions, some aggregates have been demonstrated to present distinct luminescent properties such as tunable emission spectra, improved photoluminescence quantum yields, different emission mechanism and enhanced horizontal transition dipole ratio (&#920;) of emitting layer, providing feasible solution for ACQ problem. The luminescence from newly generated emissive state in aggregates is different from the traditional &#8220;isolated&#8221; molecules in organic electronics and will possess novel properties and applications.

&lt;p&gt;The effective luminescence of aggregates demonstrates excellent photophysical properties that are distinct from the &#8220;isolated&#8221; monomer and offers feasible solution for aggregated-caused quenching problem, which facilitates realizing outstanding electroluminescent performance. Here, highly efficient OLEDs based on aggregated emitters with different luminescent mechanisms achieved through intermolecular interactions modulation are highlighted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adverse aggregated-caused quenching (ACQ) problem of most electroluminescent materials existing in highly doped thin films is one of the key factors impeding the commercialization of high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) panel. Whereas, by delicately constructing and modulating moderate intermolecular interactions, some aggregates have been demonstrated to present distinct luminescent properties such as tunable emission spectra, improved photoluminescence quantum yields, different emission mechanism and enhanced horizontal transition dipole ratio (&#920;) of emitting layer, providing feasible solution for ACQ problem. The luminescence from newly generated emissive state in aggregates is different from the traditional &#8220;isolated&#8221; molecules in organic electronics and will possess novel properties and applications. Herein, we summarize the different types of intermolecular interactions within emitter aggregates exhibiting distinct luminescent mechanisms, as well as their effects on photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties, offering reliable reference for the advancement of highly efficient OLEDs utilizing aggregated emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prebiotic Formation of Peptides Through Bubbling and Arc Plasma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides formation from amino acids in a simulation of lightning scene occurring on the sea surface of the early Earth. We constructed this scenario in lab by simply combining bubble and arc plasma without any additional reagents and its effectiveness of prebiotic synthesis from a wide range of 20 amino acids was validated.







Abstract
The abiotic synthesis of peptides, widely regarded as one of the key chemical reactions on the prebiotic Earth, is thermodynamically constrained in solution. Herein, a simulation of the lightning phenomenon on the sea surface using bubble bursting and arc plasma under ambient conditions enables dipeptide formation of six amino acids with conversion ratios ranging from 2.6&#8201;% to 25.5&#8201;%. Additionally, we observed the formation of biologically active tripeptides and investigated the stereoselectivity of the dipeptide formation reaction. By utilizing a mixture of 20 amino acids in the reaction, 102 possible dipeptides were generated. These results establish experimental constructions to mimic achievable prebiotic conditions and provide a credible pathway for endogenous biopolymer synthesis on prebiotic Earth.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation of Formate for Hydrocarboxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we disclose a heterogeneous photocatalytic strategy of C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes over zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4) under visible light. Mechanistic investigations indicate that C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate is induced by S&#8901; species on the surface of ZnIn2S4 via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) instead of a photogenerated hole oxidation mechanism.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven carboxylation offers a promising approach for synthesizing valuable fine chemicals under mild conditions. Here we disclose a heterogeneous photocatalytic strategy of C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes over zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4) under visible light. This protocol functions well with a variety of substituted styrenes with good to excellent yields; it also works for unactivated alkenes albeit with lower yields. Mechanistic studies confirm the existence of CO2&#8901;&#8722; as a key intermediate. It was found that C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of formate is induced by S&#8901; species on the surface of ZnIn2S4 via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) instead of a photogenerated hole oxidation mechanism. Moreover, both cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;H of HCOO&#8722; and formation of a benzylic anion were found to be involved in the rate&#8208;determining step for the hydrocarboxylation of styrene.

         <title>Elucidating Mechanism and Selectivity in Pyridine Functionalization through Silylium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles through silylium activation demonstrates exceptional selectivity and efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the detailed silylium catalysis mechanism and elucidate the origins of selectivity in this reaction. The phosphoramidimidate sulfonamide (PADI) precatalyst orchestrates of the catalytic cycle via three elementary steps. The Br&#248;nsted acidity of precatalyst significantly influences both the formation of silylium&#8208;based Lewis acid active species and the silylium activation of pyridine. Unlike disulfonimide (DSI)&#8208;type precatalysts, both Tf2NH and PADI precatalysts with strong acidities can easily promote the generation of activated silylium pyridine species. A semi&#8208;enclosed 'rigid' electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions constructs a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating engagement with the positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and less steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the product with C4&#8208;regioselectivity was predominantly generated.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) chromophores have been at the forefront of current energy research owing to their facile charge transfer (CT) characteristics, which are primitive for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we have designed and developed a new set of benzothiadiazole (BTD)&#8208;based tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD)/dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ)&#8208;embedded multimodular D&#8208;A systems (BTD1&#8208;BTD6) and investigated their inherent photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time having identical and mixed terminal donors of variable donor&#8208;ability. Apart from poor luminescence, the appearance of broad low&#8208;lying optical transitions extendable even in the NIR region (&gt; 1000 nm), particularly in the presence of the auxiliary acceptors, are indicative of underlying nonradiative excited state processes leading to strong intramolecular CT and subsequent charge separation (CS) processes in these D&#8208;A constructs. The spectral and temporal responses of different photoproducts are obtained from&#160; transient studies. All the systems are found to be susceptible to ultrafast (~ps) CT and CS before carrier recombination to the ground state, which is, however, significantly facilitated after incorporation of the secondary TCBD/DCNQ acceptors, leading to faster and thus efficient CT processes. These findings are likely to expand the horizons of BTD&#8208;based multimodular CT systems to revolutionize the realm of solar energy conversion and associated photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The ability of an anion to serve as electron&#8208;accepting Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond is assessed via DFT calculations. NH3 is taken as the common base, and is paired with a host of ACln&#8208; anions, with central atom A = Ca, Sr, Mg, Te, Sb, Hg, Zn, Ag, Ga, Ti, Sn, I, and B. Each anion reacts through its &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole although the electrostatic potential of this hole is quite negative in most cases. Despite the contact between this negative hole and the negative region of the approaching nucleophile, the electrostatic component of the interaction energy of each bond is highly favorable, and accounts for more than half of the total attractive energy. The double negative charge of dianions precludes a stable complex with NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster Stabilized by Boron Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of boron&#8208;based molecular rotors stems from boron&#8208;carbon binary clusters containing multiple planar hypercoordinate carbons (phCs, such as C2B8). However, the design of boron&#8208;coordinated phCs is challenging due to boron's tendency to occupy hypercoordinate centers more than carbon. Although this challenge has been addressed, the designed clusters of interest have not exhibited dynamic fluxionality similar to that of the initial C2B8. To address this issue, we report a &#963;/&#960; doubly aromatic CB2H5+ cluster, the first global minimum containing a boron&#8208;coordinated planar tetracoordinate carbon atom with dynamic fluxionality. Dynamics simulations show that two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, resulting in an intriguing dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. Electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of the ligand H atoms because they do not participate in &#960; delocalized bonding nor bond to any other non&#8208;carbon atom, highlighting this rotational fluxionality. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process involves not only the usual conversion of the number of bonding atoms, but also the type of bonding (3c &#960; bonds &#8596; 4c &#963; bonds), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster represents an effort to apply phC species to molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevating Oxygen Evolution using Iron Phthalocyanine Infused Vanillic acid Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in &#160;water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage. &#160;Transition metal based N4 organics are explored extensively as oxygen electrocatalysts i.e.,&#160;(OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts because of their ease of synthesis, tuneable properties, low cost and high performance with long term stability. Here, vanillic acid functionalized iron phthalocyanine (FeVAPc) was synthesised and characterised. The novel FeVAPc exhibited good thermal stability and was coated on Ni foam for OER studies. The scanning electron microscopy images showed net&#8208;work like surface morphology and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The Ni/FeVAPc demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA.cm&#8208;2 current density in 1.0 M KOH . The designed&#160; catalyst exhibited lesser Tafel slope value which is nearer to the benchmark catalyst, IrO2. The proposed catalyst exhibited good stability as phthalocyanines are highly stable and do not undergo decomposition even in strong acidic and basic corrosive media. Integration of FeVAPc onto&#160; Ni foam resulted in higher mass activity, lower charge transfer resistance, high active surface area leading to enhanced conductivity and activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Esterase Catalytic Activity of Minimalist Heptapeptide Amyloid Fibers.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper investigates the esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers composed of short seven&#8208;residue peptides, IHIHIHI (IH7) and IHIHIQI (IH7Q), with a particular focus on the role of the sixth residue position within the peptide sequence. Through computational simulations and analyses, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis in these amyloid&#8208;based enzymes. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our study reveals that the twist angle of the fiber, and thus the catalytic site's environment, is not notably affected by the sixth residue. Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8208;NO2 group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid&#8208;based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Adsorption of Prochiral Solvent Molecules by Surface&#8208;Confined Chiral Supramolecular Assemblies: How Solvent Impacts On&#8208;Surface Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The understanding of supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assembled molecular networks (SAMNs) on surfaces generates a lot of interest because of its relation to the production of chiral sensors, reactors, and catalysts. We herein report the adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene (cDBA) derivative. Through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule, the supramolecular chirality of the SAMN is switched: the cDBA exclusively forms a counter&#8208;clockwise pore through co&#8208;adsorption of the solvent molecule in prochiral 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, while in 1&#8208;phenyloctane it produces the opposite chiral, clockwise pore. The prochirality recognition of the solvent molecule in the chiral SAMN pores is attributed to the adaptable conformational changes of the chiral chains of the cDBA molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Origins of Temperature&#8208;Dependent Anomeric Selectivity in Glycosylations with an L&#8208;Idose Thioglycoside</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;Idose thioglycosides are useful glycosyl donors for the construction of glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides. When activated with NIS and catalytic TMSOTf in the presence of methanol, the stereoselectivity of O&#8208;glycosylation displays an intriguing dependence on the reaction temperature, with an increased preference for formation of the &#945;&#8208;glycoside at higher temperatures. Using a combination of vt&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we show how a simple mechanistic model, based on competing reactions of the iodinated thioglycoside, can explain the main features of the temperature dependence. In this model, the increased selectivity at high temperature is attributed to differences among the entropy and energy terms of the competing reaction pathways. Neighbouring&#8208;group participation (giving an intermediate acyloxonium ion) plays an increasingly dominant role as temperature is raised. The general features of this kinetic regime may also apply more broadly to other glycosylations that likewise favour &#945;&#8208;glycoside formation at high temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Nanoclusters whose Photoluminescent Properties are Dynamically Tunable by Modulating the Assembly Pathway Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the assembly pathway is an indispensable strategy for optimizing the performance of optical materials. However, implementing this strategy is nontrivial for metal nanocluster building blocks, due to the limited functional modification of nanoclusters and complexity of their emission mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that a gold nanocluster modified by 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in methanol (MeOH)/water mixed solvent, thus exhibiting pathway complexity. Kinetic studies show that DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamicallycontrolled). In&#8208;depth analysis of the assembly mechanism reveals that the transformation of aggregation structures involves the disassembly of nanofibers and a subsequent nucleation&#8208;growth process. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) measurements reveal that inter&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding bridged by solvent molecules and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction are the key factors for emission enhancement. The photoluminescent property of DPT&#8208;AuNCs can be controlled by varying the cosolvent in water, enabling DPT&#8208;AuNCs to distinguish different kind of alcohols, particularly the isomerism n&#8208;propanol (NPA) and isopropanol (IPA). Additionally, he addition of seeds effectively regulate the assembly kinetics of DPT&#8208;AuNCs. This study advances our understanding of assembly pathways and improves the luminescent performance of nanoclusters (NCs).</dc:description>

         <title>A peptide strategy for inhibiting different protein aggregation pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation&#8208;prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8208;30% flexible, 30&#8208;40% aliphatic and 20&#8208;30% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington&#8217;s disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early aggregation stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross&#8208;mechanistic, multi&#8208;targeting aggregation inhibitors may be lead compounds for developing drug candidates against various protein aggregation diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Transition&#8208;MetalExternal Photosensitizer Free Benzylic Fluorination of Unactivated Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A green and efficient protocol for the direct monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed, without any extraneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts or photosensitizers. This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism might be responsible for the generation of the benzylic radicals in initiation step.</dc:description>

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Octopus and the CLICK Procedure in Columnar Liquid Crystal Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two star&#8208;shaped mesogens with a (meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato) zinc (II) core and bithiophene conjugated arms with 3,4,5&#8208;trisdodecyloxyphenyl periphery were synthesized. One of these molecules was decorated with four fullerenes via an aliphatic spacer. This is the sterically overcrowded compound with an octapodal morphology. The other star lacks the fullerenes and provides free space between the conjugated arms. This mesogen does not aggregate in solution, but in solid state it forms a hexagonal columnar and a highly ordered oblique helical columnar phase, while the octopus molecule assemble in an amorphous solid. Photophysical studies of the octapodal compound in solution and the solid thin film reveal the formation of J&#8208;type aggregates, in which the interaction between donors (porphyrin) and acceptors (fullerene) dominates leading to absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectra. The mixture of both compounds results in a self&#8208;assembly which is called the Click procedure. Fullerenes of the octopus nanosegregate in the pockets of the star mesogens generating hexagonal columnar structures with a regular stacking along the columnar axis. Thus providing free space is a tool to control the competition between supramolecular interactions and nanosegregation. Such liquid&#8208;crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor structures may play a role in future LC photovoltaic applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) has evolved as a new scientific discipline around the boundary of highly active fields: electrochemistry and photocatalysis. EPC allows us to combine the energy of light and electric potential to activate previously inaccessible compounds via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Herein, we review the most essential applications of EPC to the C&#8208;H functionalization of molecules. This work discusses mechanisms that can be encountered when designing such processes and analyzes technical aspects of performing EPC reactions in the laboratory.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition for Encapsulation of a Stilbazolium&#8208;Type Dye with Enhanced Photophysical Properties and Nonlinear Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing organic composite materials through molecular recognition has emerged as an important theme in materials science. Here we report an ion&#8208;pair recognition system involving the use of a propoxylated pillar[5]arene (PrP5) to modulate the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of dye trans&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;stilbazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMASP). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the dye guest DMASP is encapsulated by PrP5 to form a 2:1 host&#8722;guest complex 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP in the crystalline state. The macrocyclic skeleton of PrP5 imposes restrictions on the intramolecular motions of the dye guest, leading to a significant enhancement of its fluorescence emission. Additionally, within the 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP complex crystal structure, DMASP molecules are found to display two possible opposite orientations in the one&#8208;dimensional channels formed by PrP5 molecules. This arrangement is believed to alter the overall solid&#8208;state packing structure of DMASP, thereby activating its nonlinear optical activity. This work not only reports a novel ion&#8208;pair molecular recognition system based on pillararenes but also provides valuable insights into the modulation of the crystalline state photophysical properties of organic dyes via cocrystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Switching in Azine&#8208;Containing Fluorophores Displaying Resonance&#8208;Stabilized ESIPT Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reports the synthesis, along with structural and photophysical characterization of 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives functionalized with various azaheterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine, terpyridine). These compounds show dual&#8208;state emission properties, that is intense fluorescence both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state with a range of fluorescent color going from blue to orange. Moreover, the nature of their excited state can be tuned by the presence of external stimuli such as protons or metal cations. In the absence of stimuli, these dyes show emission stemming from anionic species obtained after deprotonation (D* transition), whereas upon protonation or metal chelation, ESIPT process occurs leading to a stabilized and highly emissive K* transition. With the help of extensive ab initio calculations, we confirm that external stimuli can switch the nature of the transitions, making this series of dyes attractive candidates for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent ratiometric probes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article reports the synthesis, along with structural and photophysical characterization of 2-(2&#8217;-hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives functionalized with various azaheterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine, terpyridine). These compounds show dual-state emission properties, that is intense fluorescence both in solution and in the solid-state with a range of fluorescent color going from blue to orange. Moreover, the nature of their excited state can be tuned by the presence of external stimuli such as protons or metal cations.

         <title>Transition Metal Complexes with Appended Benzimidazole Groups for Sensing Dihydrogenphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new complexes [Ru(bpy)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Ru(phen)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Re(CO)3(bbib)(py)](PF6) and [Ir(ppy)2(bbib)](PF6) [where bbib = 4,4'&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridine] have been prepared and their photophysical properties determined. Their behaviour has been studied with a variety of anions in acetonitrile, DMSO and 10% aquated DMSO. Acetate and dihydrogenphosphate demonstrate a redshift in the bbib ligand associated absorptions suggesting that the ligand is strongly interacting with these anions. The&#160;3MLCT emissive state is sensitive to the introduction of small quantities of anion (sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities) and significant quenching is typically observed with acetate, although this is less pronounced in the presence of water. The emissive&#160;behaviour with dihydrogenphosphate is variable, showing systematic changes as anion concentration increases with several distinct interactions evident .&#160;1H NMR and&#160;31P NMR titrations in a 10% D2O &#8211; D6&#8208;DMSO mixture suggest that with dihydrogenphosphate, the imidazole group able to act as both a proton acceptor and donor. It appears that all four complexes can form a {[complex]2&#8208;H2PO4} &#8220;dimer&#8221;, a one&#8208;to&#8208;one species (which the X&#8208;ray crystallography study suggests is dimeric in the solid&#8208;state), and a complex with a combined bis(dihydrogenphosphate) complex anion. The speciation relies on complex equilibria dependent on several factors including the complex charge, the hydrophobicity of the associated ligands, and the solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimers and 2D Networks of Adamantane&#8208;Related Ternary Organosilicon Coinage Metal Sulfide Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adamantane&#8208;type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal&#8208;phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon&#8208;based congener [(PhSi)4S6]&#160;(A) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et3PAg)3(PhSi)3S6] (B) and [Na2(thf)2.33][(Me3PCu)(PhSi)3S6] (C). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe2Ph)3] (1) and [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 (2), the study addresses reactions of A with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2, upon which A is completely disassembled to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#181;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph] (3). In another case a CH2 group, most likely stemming from CH2Cl2, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH2P(Ph2)CH2CH2}2] (4). Upon using CuCl and 1,4&#8209;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine&#8208;bridged analog of B, [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2] (5). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of C, we used PMe2Ph as a bulkier ligand. This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6] (6). UV&#8208;visible spectra of 6 indicated a bandgap of 3.89 eV, thus blue&#8208;shifted in regards to B and C.</dc:description>
