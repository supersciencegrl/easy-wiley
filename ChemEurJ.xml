         <title>Micro&#8208;Mesoporous Carbons from Cyclodextrin Nanosponges Enabling High&#8208;Capacity Silicon Anodes and Sulfur Cathodes for Lithiated Si&#8208;S Batteries</title>

A facile production strategy to synthesize Si and S directly within porous carbon derived from cyclodextrin nanosponges. These materials act as high capacity electrodes in Lithiated Si&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. Their typical structure of truncated cone can host a wide variety of guest molecules to create inclusion complexes; indeed, we daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high&#8208;capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and guarantees stable cycling performance. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. We show that the use of commercial LP30 electrolyte causes a larger capacity fade, and this is associated with different solid electrolyte interface layer formation and it is also demonstrated that fluoroethylene carbonate addition can significantly increase the capacity retention and the overall performance of our nanostructured Si/C composite in both ether&#8208;based and LP30 electrolytes. As a result, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8722;S cell.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Fe/N/C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Containing Fe&#8722;N4 Sites from an Iron Complex Precursor with 5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;Diazatriphenylene Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts are prepared from iron complex precursors containing 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene ligands with two bromo substituents by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. The iron complex precursors were efficiently converted to atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 active sites without generating less active iron aggregates during pyrolysis. The Fe&#8722;N4 active sites were identified by STEM&#8208;EELS observations and in&#8197;situ electrochemical Fe K edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic measurements. The Fe/N/C catalysts show high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts containing Fe&#8722;Nx sites prepared by pyrolysis are promising cathode materials for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. We have developed iron complexes containing N2&#8208; or N3&#8208;chelating coordination structures with preorganized aromatic rings in a 1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene framework tethering bromo substituents as precursors to precisely construct Fe&#8722;N4 sites in an Fe/N/C catalyst. One&#8208;step pyrolysis of the iron complex with carbon black forms atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 sites without iron aggregates. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical measurements revealed that the iron complex with N3&#8208;coordination is more effectively converted to Fe&#8722;N4 sites catalyzing ORR with a TOF value of 0.21&#8197;e&#8201;site&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE. This indicates that the formation of Fe&#8722;N4 sites is controlled by precise tuning of the chemical structure of the iron complex precursor.

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competition for the lone pair: Our paper describes efforts to access cationic &#945;&#8208;silylated (and &#945;&#8208;germylated) phosphorus ylides of the general formula [R3PC(R)SiR2]+. One inherent feature of these molecules is that the silyl and phosphonyl entities compete for the lone pair of electrons. The ambivalent nature of the possible resonance structures is reflected in the coloured segmentation of the cover feature. The two &#8220;competitors&#8221; are illustrated as sportspersons, and both resonance structures are represented depending on where the ball of positive change is. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Breher et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103974).

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;Dependent AIE Fluorophore Based on HBT Derivative: Substituent Positional Impact on Aggregated Luminescence and its Application for Hydrogen Peroxide Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two positional isomers are presented, p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT, and their structural feature is mainly different in one BT substituent position on HBT fluorophore. Surprisingly, they exhibited totally opposite luminescence behaviour in water/THF cosolvents with different water volume fractions (fw). More importantly, the unique AIE&#8208;ESIPT properties allowed p&#8208;BHBT to construct the chemosensor, Probe&#8208;1, for highly selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.







Abstract
Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to p&#8208;BHBT and ortho position refers to o&#8208;BHBT). Fluorescence emission properties of p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which p&#8208;BHBT showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while o&#8208;BHBT displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, Probe&#8208;1, generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore p&#8208;BHBT, was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22&#8197;&#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.

         <title>Light&#8208;assisted Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides: The synergetic effect between plasmonic copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes from various sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, we loaded plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving the high yield of diaryl ethers. We believe that this study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically&#8208;sustainable process.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin states, bonding and magnetism in mixed valence iron(0)&#8211;iron(II) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>"Xenophilic" complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe&#160;two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8211;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8211;Fp (LX&#160;=&#160;b&#8208;aldiminate or&#160;b&#8208;diketim&#173;inate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into the Fe&#8211;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electro&#173;static interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8211;&#160;"metalloligand" as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange&#8208;red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In case of orange&#8208;red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters. And the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange&#8208;red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra, therefore more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters based on molecular structures such as cyano benzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron based acceptors. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: A Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designer tri&#8208;block copolymer is described to broaden epigenetic combination therapy. Upon intracellular reduction and esterase hydrolysis, it releases nothing but HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug, CO2, and PEG. The design is rooted from a thiol&#8208;based HDACi, for which optimization balances requirements of both efficacy and control&#8208;release, highlighting a new paradigm in polyprodrug nanomedicine: taking pharmaceutics guidelines into account at the medicinal chemistry stage.







Abstract
We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end&#8208;to&#8208;end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach, carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work highlights, for the first time, the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.

Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built-in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end-to-end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach, carefully designed to benefit both control-release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work highlights, for the first time, the unique advantage of thiol-based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mild Microfluidic Approaches to Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the preparation of oxide nanoparticles in microreactors under continuous flow conditions. The use of suitable methodologies allows to manage the size and shape of the nanoparticles, through the fast mixing of the reagents and the precise control of the reaction conditions that can be achieved within flow devices, if compared to batch syntheses.







Abstract
Oxide nanoparticles (oxide NPs) are advanced materials with a wide variety of applications in different fields. The use of continuous flow methods is particularly appealing for their synthesis due to the high control achieved over the reaction conditions and the easy process scalability. The present review focuses on the preparation of oxide NPs using microfluidic setups at low temperature (&#8804;80&#8201;&#176;C), since the employment of mild reaction conditions is crucial for developing sustainable and cost&#8208;effective processes. A particular emphasis will be put on the improvement over the final product features (e.&#8201;g., size, shape, and size distribution) given by flow methods with respect to conventional batch procedures. The main issues that arise by treating NPs suspensions in microfluidic systems are product deposition or channel clogging; mitigation strategies to overcome these drawbacks will also be presented and discussed.

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular uptake of high&#8208;density brush polymers with peptide side chains is governed by the net charge of the polymers. Stimuli responsive cleavable linkers are employed to control the charge of the polymers and to trigger cellular uptake of brush polymers possessing a net positive charge.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids through stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.

         <title>Understanding the Preparation and Reactivity of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The life of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5. Non&#8208;oxidative methane dehydroaromatization is a high&#8208;temperature reaction taking place over zeolite&#8208;based Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst. We used operando spectroscopy to monitor the structural evolution of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 during its whole lifetime: from catalyst synthesis and activation to reaction, deactivation, and regeneration. We derived spectroscopic descriptors for molybdenum precursor decomposition, reduction of dispersed Mo&#8208;oxo centers to form active sites and, finally, evolution of active sites during reductive and oxidative regeneration.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts during their whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of similar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincides with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalysts.

         <title>Assessing the Importance of Cation Size in the Tetragonal&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition in Lithium&#8208;Garnet Electrolytes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high temperature tetragonal&#8208;cubic phase in lithium garnet electrolytes (A3B2Li7O12) is not fully understood. Herein, the transition temperature dependence based on site substitution is investigated, surprisingly it was found a direct relationship to cell volume is perhaps too simplistic. We show that the B site plays an important role, whereas A site substitution (which alters the cell volume noticeably) has minimal difference. The octahedral site ionic radius required to stabilise a room temperature A3B2Li7O12 cubic phase is then suggested.







Abstract
Lithium garnets are promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of seven lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g., La3Zr2Li7O12), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8211;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub&#8208;lattice.
The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.
Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed by variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium garnets are promising solid-state electrolytes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of seven lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g., La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8211;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub-lattice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed by variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The rapid development of industrialization and population brings water and air pollution and energy crisis. Solar driven catalysis is expected to relieve above issues. However, low efficiency of solar conversion limited by poor light harvesting and serious charge recombination of semiconductors and high surface reaction barriers is far from the satisfactory of industrial request. Ferroelectrics have been considered as promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO  3  , PbTiO  3  and LiNbO  3  , layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like BiFeO  3  , Bi  2  WO  6  , Bi  2  MoO  6  , etc. and other ferroelectrics have been introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method have been highlighted. Then, the research progress of ferroelectrics for photocatalysis has been summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO  2  reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts have been provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present a deep insight and guideline for the future research works of ferroelectrics  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Ferroelectric Metallomesogen Exhibiting Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional Co(II) compound exhibiting liquid crystal, ferroelectricity, and field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior has been synthesized for the first time. The results provide new insights towards the development of a new category of magnetoelectric (ME) materials.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) materials exhibiting coupled electric and magnetic properties are of significant interest because of their potential use in memory storage devices, new sensors, or low&#8208;consumption devices. Herein, we report a new category of ME material that shows liquid crystal (LC), ferroelectric (FE), and field&#8208;induced single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviors. Co(II) complex incorporating alkyl chains of type [Co(3C16&#8208;bzimpy)2](BF4)2 (1; 3C16&#8208;bzimpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;hexadecyloxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;hexadecyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)) displayed a chiral smectic C mesophase in the temperature range 321&#8197;K&#8211;458&#8197;K, in which distinct FE behavior was observed, with a remnant polarization (88.3&#8197;nC&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Complex 1 also exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior that reflects the large magnetic anisotropy of the Co(II) center. Furthermore, the dielectric property of 1 was able to be tuned by an external magnetic field occurring from both spin&#8208;lattice coupling and molecular orientational variation. Clearly, this multifunctional compound, combining LC, FE, and SMM properties, represents an entry to the development of a range of next&#8208;generation ME materials.

         <title>Spiroconjugated Tetraaminospirenes as Donors in Color&#8208;Tunable Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emitters go spiro: Using spiroconjugated tetraamines as a novel type of donor and a range of different acceptors in three different modes of connection, 12 donor&#8208;acceptor compounds are synthesized. Their twisted structures lead to a spatial separation of the HOMOs and LUMOs. Photophysical measurements show tunable emission colors for these donor&#8208;acceptor compounds, and photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 99&#8201;% in solution are obtained.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer emitters are attractive due to their color tunability and potentially high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). We herein present tetraaminospirenes as donor moieties, which, in combination with a variety of acceptors, furnished 12 charge&#8208;transfer emitters with a range of emission colors and PLQYs of up to 99&#8201;%. The spatial separation of their frontier molecular orbitals was obtained through careful structural design, and two DA structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A range of photophysical measurements supported by DFT calculations shed light on the optoelectronic properties of this new family of spiro&#8208;NN&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor dyes.

         <title>Molecular Modelling and Simulations of Light&#8208;Harvesting Decanuclear Ru&#8208;Based Dendrimers for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molucular simulations on the structure of a decanuclear Ru&#8208;based dendrimer capable to play the role of antenna for artificial photosynthesis is performed. Aggregation of dendrimers is also modelled and compared to experimental results obtained by SAXS, scanning tunneling electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
The structure of a decanuclear photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active dendrimer based on Ru(II) polypyridine subunits, suitable as a light&#8208;harvesting multicomponent species for artificial photosynthesis, has been investigated by means of computer modelling. The compound has the general formula [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru[(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru(bpy)2]2}3](PF6)20 (Ru10; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; dpp=2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazine). The stability of possible isomers of each monomer was investigated by performing classical molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM) simulations on each monomer and comparing the results. The number of stable isomers is reduced to 36 with a prevalence of MER isomerism in the central core, as previously observed by NMR experiments. The simulations on decanuclear dendrimers suggest that the stability of the dendrimer is not linked to the stability of the individual monomers composing the dendrimer but rather governed by the steric constrains originated by the multimetallic assembly. Finally, the self&#8208;aggregation of Ru10 and the distribution of the counterions around the complexes is investigated using Molecular Dynamics both in implicit and explicit acetonitrile solution. In representative examples, with nine and four dendrimers, the calculated pair distribution function for the ruthenium centers suggests a self&#8208;aggregation mechanism in which the dendrimers are approaching in small blocks and then aggregate all together. Scanning transmission electron microscopy complements the investigation, supporting the formation of different aggregates at various concentrations.

         <title>Chiral Ligands in Hypervalent Iodine Compounds: Synthesis and Structures of Binaphthyl&#8208;Based &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contained chirality: Novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents are presented with the chirality contained only in the ligand. These have been characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, and all derivatives show the prominent reactivities of hypervalent iodine reagents. Due to their limited stability in solution, they are inefficient chiral iodine(III) derivatives.







Abstract
Several novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents have been prepared and structurally analysed. Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed; however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. NMR experiments indicated that these reagents are very easily hydrolysed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to the limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contained chirality&lt;/b&gt;: Novel binaphthyl-based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents are presented with the chirality contained only in the ligand. These have been characterized by X-ray analysis, and all derivatives show the prominent reactivities of hypervalent iodine reagents. Due to their limited stability in solution, they are inefficient chiral iodine(III) derivatives.

         <title>Direct Near Infrared Light&#8211;Activatable Phthalocyanine Catalysts</title>

Going in for infra red: The development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules is described. The choice of solvent is important to promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction involves a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.







Abstract
The high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light makes it effective for use in selective reactions under light&#8208;shielded conditions, such as in sealed reactors and deep tissues. Herein, we report the development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules. The desired photocatalytic properties were achieved in the phthalocyanines by introducing the appropriate peripheral substituents and central metal. These phthalocyanine photocatalysts promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling (CDC) under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. The choice of solvent is important, and a mixture of a reaction&#8208;accelerating (pyridine) and &#8208;decelerating (methanol) solvents was particularly effective. Moreover, we demonstrate photoreactions under visible&#8208;light&#8208;shielded conditions through the transmission of NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction does not involve a photoredox&#8208;type mechanism with electron transfer, but instead a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.

Compounds [1]+.[R]&#8722; and [1]2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[R]&#8722; have been prepared from the respective one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron transfer reactions of 1,4&#8208;disilabenzene (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (1) by using the transferable organometallic oxidants and characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;transferable oxidants such as B(C6F5)3/nBuLi, B(C6F5)3/LiB(C6F5)4, B(C6F5)3/LiHBEt3, Al(C6F5)3/(o&#8208;RC6H4)AlH2 (R=N(CMe2CH2)2CH2), B(C6F5)3/AlEt3, Al(C6F5)3, Al(C6F5)3/nBuLi, Al(C6F5)3/AlMe3, (CuC6F5)4, and Ag2SO4, respectively were employed for reactions with (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (L=PhC(NtBu)2, 1). The stable radical cation [1]+. was formed and paired with the anions [nBuB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 2), [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (in 3), [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 4), [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 5), {[(C6F5)3Al]2(&#956;&#8208;F)]&#8722; (in 6), [nBuAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 7), and [Cu(C6F5)2]&#8722; (in 8), respectively. The stable dication [1]2+ was also generated with the anions [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (9) and [MeAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (10), respectively. In addition, the neutral compound [(L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2][&#956;&#8208;O2S(O)2] (11) was obtained. Compounds 2&#8211;11 are characterized by UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and elemental analysis. Compounds 2&#8211;8 are analyzed by EPR spectroscopy and compounds 9&#8211;11 by NMR spectroscopy. The structure features are discussed on the central Si2C4&#8208;rings of 1, [1]+., [1]2+, and 11, respectively.

         <title>Synergy of Iron Doping and Cyano Groups for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production over C3N4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17628-17636, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe doping improves the absorption of visible light and the conductivity of the material, and promotes the dissociation of excitons, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity. The internal donor&#8208;acceptor system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites enhanced charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pairs. The porous structure provides a higher specific surface area and pore structure, which provides a large number of active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
Improving the insufficient carrier separation dynamics is still of significance in carbon nitride (C3N4) research. Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the synergistic enhancement effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group&#8208;containing Fe&#8208;doped C3N4 porous materials via direct co&#8208;calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine for synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation of cyano groups and form Fe&#8208;doping in C3N4, thereby increasing the visible&#8208;light absorption and reactive sites. Further, the internal donor&#8208;acceptor system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8722;CN&#8208;2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C3N4 (BCN).

Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the synergistic enhancement effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group-containing Fe-doped C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; porous materials via direct co-calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine for synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation of cyano groups and form Fe-doping in C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby increasing the visible-light absorption and reactive sites. Further, the internal donor-acceptor system formed by cyano groups and Fe-doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8722;CN-2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (BCN).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A convenient and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component perfluoroalkylation/aminocarbonylation strategy for accessing &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides has been developed. A wide range of readily available substrates including amines (anilines, alkylamines, sulfonamide, sulfonyl hydrazide, hydrazine, and hydrazides), perfluoroalkyl halides, and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds (alkyl olefins, alkynes, and alkyl allenes) were transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides in moderate to high yields with good chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent carbonylation is one of the most efficient strategies to construct carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component perfluoroalkylation/aminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes with perfluoroalkyl halides, and amines was developed. A wide range of substrates, including anilines, alkylamines, sulfonamides, and hydrazines are all suitable reaction partners for this catalyst system, resulting in various &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity. Furthermore, not only alkyl olefins, but also aliphatic alkynes, and even alkyl allenes can all be employed. Notably, several medical and bioactive related molecules are compatible here as well.

Shedding new light on an old mechanism: Previous studies have suggested that the polymerization of 3&#8217;,5&#8217; cyclic guanosine monophosphate proceeds according to a base&#8208;catalyzed mechanism. In contrast, our work supports an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction route that benefits from the unique ability of the free&#8208;acid form monomers to crystallize, and thus form highly ordered supramolecular architectures. The reaction could serve as a source of the most ancient short oligonucleotide sequences on our planet.







Abstract
The assembly of ancient informational polymers from nucleotide precursors is the central challenge of life's origin on our planet. Among the possible solutions, dry polymerization of 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cGMP) has been proposed as a candidate to create oligonucleotides of 15&#8211;20&#8197;units in length. However, the reported sensitivity of the reaction to the presence of cations raised questions of whether this chemistry could be relevant in a geological context. The experiments in this study show that the presence of cations is not restrictive as long as the reaction is conducted in an acidic environment, in contrast to previous reports that suggested optimal conditions at pH&#8197;9.

         <title>Fluorination Reactions at a Platinum Carbene Complex: Reaction Routes to SF3, S(=O)F and Fluorido Complexes</title>

Studies on the reactivity of thionyl fluoride and sulfur tetrafluoride towards the Pt(0) complex [Pt(IMes)2] led to the generation of Pt(II) SF3 and SOF complexes. The activation of SF6 at [Pt(IMes)2] gave a variety of fluorido complexes, some of which were synthesized independently by fluorination with HF or XeF2.







Abstract
The electron&#8208;rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)2] (IMes: [1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds. The sulfur fluoride SF4 undergoes a rapid oxidative addition at Pt0 to yield trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SF3)(IMes)2]. A photolytic reaction of SF6 at [Pt(IMes)2] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SF3)(IMes)2] along with trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)] (IMes&#8217;: cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water. trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(IMes)2] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)2] with SOF2 or XeF2. A reaction of [Pt(IMes)2] with a HF source gave trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)2], and an intermediate bifluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(FHF)(IMes)2] was identified. Compound trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)2] converts in the presence of CsF into trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)].

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc Oligosaccharides Using an Endo&#8208;Glycosynthase</title>

         <dc:description>
An enzymatic cascade synthesis of long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc oligosaccharides perfectly controlled in size is reported. A hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme glycosynthase was developed to catalyze the glycosylation of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Using this glycosynthase in concert with a chitin&#8208;oligosaccharide N&#8208;deacetylase allowed controlled glycosylation of the fluoride onto oligosaccharide acceptors without competing polycondensation reaction. This enzymatic cascade enabled the preparation of the important plant elicitors chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with very good yields.







Abstract
Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in Pichia pastoris at 52&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective N&#8208;deacetylation at the non&#8208;reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by Sinorhizobium meliloti NodB chitin&#8208;N&#8208;deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis on a milligram scale of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65&#8201;% and a perfect control over their size.

This enzymatic cascade enabled the preparation of the important plant elicitors chitin hexa-, hepta- and octasaccharides with very good yields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long-chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)-linked &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high-affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two-enzyme cascade to synthesize long-chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)-linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; at 52&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;-chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-deacetylation at the non-reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by &lt;i&gt;Sinorhizobium meliloti&lt;/i&gt; NodB chitin-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one-pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis on a milligram scale of chitin hexa-, hepta- and octasaccharides with yields up to 65&#8201;% and a perfect control over their size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the Boundaries between Lewis&#8208;Basic and Redox Behavior of a Parent Borylene</title>

Electrophile or nucleophile: A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208; and PMe3&#8208;stabilized parent borylene acts both as a Lewis base and reducing agent towards group 13 trihalides (EX3, E=B, Al, Ga, In, X=F, Cl, Br, I), yielding borylene&#8208;EX3 adducts and the boryl radical cation. Halide abstraction converts the borylene&#8208;BX3 adducts to the unsymmetrical borylboronium species. Computations probe the bond dissociation energy and electronic nature of the B&#8211;E bonds in the Lewis adducts.







Abstract
The parent borylene (CAAC)(Me3P)BH, 1 (CAAC=cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene), acts both as a Lewis base and one&#8208;electron reducing agent towards group 13 trichlorides (ECl3, E=B, Al, Ga, In), yielding the adducts 1&#8208;ECl3 and increasing proportions of the radical cation [1]&#8226;+ for the heavier group 13 analogues. With boron trihalides (BX3, X=F, Cl, Br, I) 1 undergoes sequential adduct formation and halide abstraction reactions to yield borylboronium cations and shows an increasing tendency towards redox processes for the heavier halides. Calculations confirm that 1 acts as a strong Lewis base towards EX3 and show a marked increase in the B&#8722;E bond dissociation energies down both group 13 and the halide group.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis of Miltefosine: Integration of Flow Chemistry with Continuous Mechanochemistry</title>

Integrating continuous flow synthesis of miltefosine with continuous mechanochemistry is reported for the first time. The total residence time for the four&#8208;step sequence is 34&#8197;minutes, which is significantly shorter than the reported traditional batch protocol (&gt;15&#8197;h). This approach facilitates continuous synthesis of the final product at a scale of 10&#8197;g/hr, which is sufficient to treat 4800 patients per day.







Abstract
Herein we report for the first time, an advanced continuous flow synthesis of the blockbuster Leishmaniasis drug miltefosine from simple starting materials by a sequence involving four steps of chemical transformation including a continuous mechanochemical step. First three reaction steps were performed in simple tubular reactors in a telescopic mode, while in the last step the product precipitated from the 3rd step was used for a continuous mechanochemical synthesis of miltefosine. When compared to a typical batch protocol that takes 15&#8197;h, miltefosine was obtained in 58&#8201;% overall yield in flow synthesis mode at the laboratory scale in a total residence time 34&#8197;min at synthesis rate of 10&#8197;g/hr, which is sufficient to treat 4800 patients per day.

Exploiting structural metamorphosis to wrap microspheres: The &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film is described. This approach utilizes dynamic covalent polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly crosslinked to intermolecularly crosslinked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur.







Abstract
There is growing interest in developing methods to &#8216;wrap&#8217; nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects within films that may offer protection, enhance their stability or improve performance. We describe the successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film. This approach utilizes polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly cross&#8208;linked to intermolecularly cross&#8208;linked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur. This work is significant as it suggests that nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects such as virus&#8208;like particles, bacteria or mammalian cells&#8212;all of which may benefit from additional environmental protection or stabilization in emerging applications&#8212;may also be &#8216;wrapped&#8217; by this approach.

Effect of halide substituents on spin and phase transitions in Mn(III) complexes







Abstract
Three tetraphenylborates of mononuclear Mn(III) cation complexes with hexadentate ligands, the products of the reaction between a N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropyl)ethylenediamine and salicylaldehydes with the different haloid substitutions at the 5 or 3,5 positions, have been synthesized: [Mn(5&#8208;F&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (1), [Mn(3,5&#8208;diCl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (2) and [Mn(3,5&#8208;Br,Cl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (3). Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (&#1013;) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (1) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high&#8208;spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low&#8208;spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes 2 and 3 are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties. Complex 2 demonstrates two structural phase transitions related to sharp spin crossovers from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase at 137&#8197;K and from the intermediate phase to the LS at 87&#8197;K, while complex 3 exhibits only one spin transition from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase at 83&#8197;K.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Amines via Mild and Selective sp3 C&#8722;H Imination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17601-17608, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One for all: We report the sp3 C&#8722;H imination of simple alkanes and functionalized molecules, which provides primary amines on workup. Our method shows good site selectivity and functional group tolerance, which we have used for the synthesis of complex amines. We characterize a unique mechanism involving radical rebound to imine.







Abstract
The direct replacement of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds with simple amine units (&#8722;NH2) remains synthetically challenging, although primary aliphatic amines are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. We report a mild and selective protocol for preparing primary and secondary aliphatic amines in a single pot, based on intermolecular sp3 C&#8722;H imination. The first C&#8722;H imination of diverse alkanes, this method shows useful site&#8208;selectivity within substrates bearing multiple sp3 C&#8722;H bonds. Furthermore, this reaction tolerates polar functional groups relevant for complex molecule synthesis, highlighted in the synthesis of amine pharmaceuticals and amination of natural products. We characterize a unique C&#8722;H imination mechanism based on radical rebound to an iminyl radical, supported by kinetic isotope effects, stereoablation, resubmission, and computational modeling. This work constitutes a selective method for complex amine synthesis and a new mechanistic platform for C&#8722;H amination.

         <title>Unveiling the Unique Roles of Metal Coordination and Modulator in the Polymorphism Control of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th4+ cation and the unexpected bridging role of formate allow polymorphism control of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration and porosity for TOFs have been achieved. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, thus suggesting that TOFs represent an excellent platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.







Abstract
Polymorphism control of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is highly desired for elucidating structure&#8208;property relationships, but remains an empirical process and is usually done in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. We adopted the rarely used actinide cation Th4+ and a ditopic linker to construct a series of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with a range of polymorphs. The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th4+ cations and clusters, coupled with synthetic modulation, gives five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration (threefold) and porosity (75.9&#8201;%) of TOFs have been achieved. Notably, the O atom on the capping site of the nine&#8208;coordinated Th4+ cation can function as a bridging unit to interconnect neighboring secondary building units (SBUs), affording topologies that are undocumented for other tetravalent&#8208;metal&#8208;containing MOFs. Furthermore, for the first time HCOOH has been demonstrated as a bridging unit of SBUs to further induce structural complexity. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, thus suggesting that TOFs represent an exceptional and promising platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.

         <title>Lanthanide Identity Governs Guest&#8208;Induced Dimerization in LnIII[15&#8208;MC
N(L&#8208;pheHA)&#8208;5])3+ Metallacrowns</title>

         <dc:description>
The formation of metallacrown compartments in neutral aqueous solution can be templated by an anionic guest, for example, muconate. As demonstrated by calorimetric and NMR techniques, metallacrowns containing larger or smaller central lanthanides only form monomeric host&#8208;guest complexes, whereas intermediate lanthanides uniquely form dimeric host2&#8208;guest compartments.







Abstract
Series of lanthanide&#8208;containing metallic coordination complexes are frequently presented as structurally analogous, due to the similar chemical and coordinative properties of the lanthanides. In the case of chiral (LnIII[15&#8208;MC
N(L&#8208;pheHA)&#8208;5])3+ metallacrowns (MCs), which are well established supramolecular hosts, the formation of dimers templated by a dicarboxylate guest (muconate) in solution of neutral pH is herein shown to have a unique dependence on the identity of the MC's central lanthanide. Calorimetric data and nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion studies demonstrate that MCs containing larger or smaller lanthanides as the central metal only form monomeric host&#8208;guest complexes whereas analogues with intermediate lanthanides (for example, Eu, Gd, Dy) participate in formation of dimeric host&#8208;guest&#8208;host compartments. The driving force for the dimerization event across the series is thought to be a competition between formation of highly stable MCs (larger lanthanides) and optimally linked bridging guests (smaller lanthanides).

         <title>Multiple Regulation Effects of Ammonium Acetate on ZnO Growth Process in Chemical Bath Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17620-17627, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final morphology of ZnO generally involves nucleation, Ostwald ripening and self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, the nucleation experienced the Zn2+&#8208;layered basic zinc salts (LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped to rod&#8208;shaped and gradually a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with the increasing concentration of ammonium acetate. The whole growth process clarifies the roles of ammonium acetate in the growth mechanism of ZnO, which may further benefit the optimal synthesis of functional structures.







Abstract
Chemical bath deposition method has been used to synthesize a variety of ZnO morphology structures. However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO3)2&#8208;HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn2+&#8208;layered basic zinc salts (LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped, rod&#8208;shaped to a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand&#8208;ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn&#8208;rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve&#8208;renucleation&#8208;regrowth process which retains the twin&#8208;shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at &#8764;10&#8197;mM ammonium acetate. Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) measurements show that the uniform hexagonal ZnO rods (Y&#8208;10, the sample named as Y&#8208;x (x represents x mM ammonium acetate, herein, x is 10&#8197;mM)) have a maximum photocurrent density of 1.54&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V (vs. RHE), much higher than that of the dumbbell&#8208;shaped ZnO rods (Y&#8208;50, 0.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at the same voltage. These results provide a further explanation of morphology regulation mechanisms on ZnO synthesis processes and pave the road for more practical applications.

Vis&#8208;&#224;&#8211;vis going green Thermal stimuli induced the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition of the blue&#8208;PL face&#8208;to&#8208;edge packed 1,8&#8208;bisphenylanthracene crystal, which experienced spontaneous propagation of the face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular packed greenish&#8208;blue&#8208;PL crystal.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;triggered crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received significant attention in the scientific community. To visualize such phenomenon, controlling the optical properties and the thermodynamic stability of the molecular crystals is a very important research subject. In this report, the selective growth of photoluminescent (PL) 1,8&#8208;bisphenylanthracene polymorphic (cI and cII) and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane&#8208;inclusion crystals (iC) under various optimized conditions is described. These crystals exhibited unique mechano&#8208; and thermoresponsive disordering, crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition, and SCSC phase transition. In particular, rapid thermostimulus SCSC occurred from blue&#8208;PL cI into greenish&#8208;blue&#8208;PL cII. Interestingly, the SCSC phase transition of cI into cII was triggered by thermal stimuli and propagated spontaneously. Thermotriggered domino&#8208;like SCSC phase transition was observed on a fully visible timescale (ca. 125&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;min&#8722;1).

N&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was used as a protecting group and a reagent to selective synthesis of various mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides. In all these reactions, the protecting reagent N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was easily regenerated in good yields by the hydrazinolysis. All these transformations showed good functional&#8208;group tolerance and can be used for large scale C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
A new route to synthesis of various mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides by involving in a new C&#8722;N bond formation by using N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide as a regenerated precursor was invented. Aniline and phenylhydrazines are reproduced upon reacting these individually with 1,8&#8208;naphthalic anhydride followed by hydrazinolysis. The practicality and simplicity of this C&#8722;N dihalo alkanes; developed a synthon for bond formation protocol was exemplified to various hydrazines and hydrazides. N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide is suitable synthon for transformation for selective formation of mono&#8208;substituted hydrazine and hydrazide derivatives. Those are selective mono&#8208;amidation of hydrazine with acid halides; mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazones from aldehydes; synthesis of N&#8208;aminoazacycloalkanes from acetohydrazide scaffold and inserted to hydroxy derivatives; distinct synthesis of N,N&#8208;dibenzylhydrazines and N&#8208;benzylhydrazines from benzyl halides; synthesis of N&#8208;amino&#8208;amino acids from &#945;&#8208;halo esters. Ecofriendly reagent N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was regenerated with good yields by the hydrazinolysis in all procedures.

Switching site&#8208;selectivity: Regiodivergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions of the alkyl side&#8208;chain of heteroaromatic ketones is reported. The presence of a pyridone ligand orients the selectivity towards &#946;&#8208;arylation, while its absence leads to &#945;&#8208;arylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;arylation follows a C&#8722;H activation pathway, whereas &#946;&#8208;arylation takes place through a C&#8722;H activation/desaturation/conjugate addition manifold. The method developed is mild and allows further functionalization of the products.







Abstract
A ligand&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of heteroaromatic ketones has been developed using Pd catalysis. The reaction occurred selectively at the &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position of the ketone side&#8208;chain. The switch from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;arylation was realized by addition of a pyridone ligand. The &#945;&#8208;arylation process showed broad scope and high site&#8208; and chemoselectivity, whereas the &#946;&#8208;arylation was more limited. Mechanistic investigations suggested that &#945;&#8208;arylation occurs through C&#8722;H activation/oxidative addition/reductive elimination whereas &#946;&#8208;arylation involves desaturation and aryl insertion.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Voltammetric Anion Sensing Under Flow**
</title>

Sensing with the flow: A continuous, real&#8208;time ion sensing methodology under flow, enabled by repeat voltammetry and accompanying data analysis, is reported for the first time, herein exemplified for halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated anion sensing at electroactive ferrocene&#8208;isophthalamide&#8208;(iodo)triazole films. The novel methodology enables sensing of multiple anionic targets, as well as long&#8208;term sensing over multiple hours with highly reproducible responses and minimal signal loss.







Abstract
The development of real&#8208;life applicable ion sensors, in particular those capable of repeat use and long&#8208;term monitoring, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we demonstrate, in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the real&#8208;time voltammetric sensing of anions under continuous flow in a 3D&#8208;printed microfluidic system. Electro&#8208;active anion receptive halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) ferrocene&#8208;isophthalamide&#8208;(iodo)triazole films were employed as exemplary sensory interfaces. Upon exposure to anions, the cathodic perturbations of the ferrocene redox&#8208;transducer are monitored by repeat square&#8208;wave voltammetry (SWV) cycling and peak fitting of the voltammograms by a custom&#8208;written MATLAB script. This enables the facile and automated data processing of thousands of SW scans and is associated with an over one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in limits of detection. In addition, this improved analysis enables tuning of the measurement parameters such that high temporal resolution can be achieved. More generally, this new flow methodology is extendable to a variety of other analytes, including cations, and presents an important step towards translation of voltammetric ion sensors from laboratory to real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Investigation of Bis(Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;Butoxy) Halogenates(I/III)</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemistry with halogens in positive oxidation states, especially the lighter halogens, is challenging due to their high oxidation potential. An ensemble of halogen +I and +III compounds with a comparatively large ligand system was synthesized and characterized with experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical methods. This study is envisioned as an example for the diverse but sometimes overlooked chemistry of group&#8197;17.







Abstract
A systematic study of halogenate(I/III) anions with polyatomic ligands is presented. The bis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I) [X(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, X=Cl, Br, I, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are prepared as their tetraethylammonium salts and characterized with IR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopic methods, as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Spectroscopical data are supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Additionally, the bonding situation of the species in question are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, the oxidation to the corresponding halogenate(III) derivatives was studied. For [Br(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, oxidation with elemental fluorine gave [BrF2(OC4F9)2]&#8722;. Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC4F9 to the IIII species [I(OC4F9)4]&#8722;, which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future. For [Cl(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, the decomposition products of the synthetic approaches towards a chlorine(III) system were analyzed.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Ferroelastic Domain and Phase Transition in a Three&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17655-17659, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ observation of ferroelastic domain processing by the thermal and stress in hybrid molecular crystal and the compound shows four dielectric phase transitions caused by the order&#8208;disorder transformation of the (MedabcoF)2+ cations and the Rb8(BF4)124&#8208; framework.







Abstract
Massive efforts have been devoted to designing molecular ferroic materials by molecular modification. For molecular ferroelastic, previous work is focused on the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelastic domains, however, few are related to controlling the ferroelastic domain by the stress. Inspired by the &#8220;quasi&#8208;spherical theory&#8221; and fluorination effect, we designed a more flexible (MedabcoF)2+ (MedabcoF=1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) cation by introducing a methyl group and a fluorine atom at the two symmetrical ends of the Dabco (1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and synthesized a hybrid 3D perovskite (MedabcoF)Rb(BF4)3 (1) which displays three reversible phase transitions accompanying dual ferroelastic behavior. Besides, it not only exhibits ferroelastic domains switching by the thermal stimulation, and the sensitive reaction of in situ domains under the stress of it is also realized. This work not only achieves a force&#8208;controlled ferroelastic domain but develops a more profound comprehension of the relationship between the thermal motion behavior of guest cations and the intriguing properties of materials.

         <title>Weinreb Amide, Ketone and Amine as Potential and Competitive Secondary Molecular Stations for Dibenzo&#8208;[24]Crown&#8208;8&#8201;in [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles</title>

New DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone stations have been synthesized and characterized. Their shuttling behavior, which is linked to the ability of the considered moieties to act as efficient secondary molecular stations of more or less high affinity for the macrocycle, depended on the combination of stations and steric restrictions.







Abstract
This paper reports the synthesis and study of new pH&#8208;sensitive DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain within their axle four potential sites of interaction for the DB24C8: ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide, and ketone. In the protonated state, the DB24C8 lay around the best ammonium site. After either deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium, different localizations of the DB24C8 were seen, depending on both the number and nature of the secondary stations and steric restriction. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that the Weinreb amide was not a proper secondary molecular station for the DB24C8. Nevertheless, through its methoxy side chain, it slowed down the shuttling of the macrocycle along the threaded axle, thereby partitioning the [2]rotaxane into two translational isomers on the NMR timescale. The ketone was successfully used as a secondary molecular station, and its weak affinity for the DB24C8 was similar to that of a secondary amine.

Environmental pollution especially by micro&#8208; and nanoplastics is highly topical our days. The elimination of these plastics is extremely difficult, however, detecting them is also very challenging. Different detection methods are discussed in the Review by L. Prodi et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;17529&#8197;ff.

A chemical way to bistable molecular shuttles that hold a combination of amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone as secondary stations for dibenzo&#8208;[24]crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) is reported. Ketone and amine moieties have similar affinity for DB24C8 that is better than the Weinreb amide has. Hydrogen bonds between DB24C8 and an unhindered axle usually favor a co&#8208;conformation; unless steric restrictions, hence the constrained co&#8208;conformation, impose a predominance of alternative and unexpected even weaker H&#8208;bonds. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gauthier and F. Coutrot (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103805).

Heat, protons and a dry crystalline material are the three prerequisites for oligonucleotide synthesis from acid&#8208;form 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate monomers. The process is believed to play a role in the abiotic generation of the most ancient RNA molecules on our planet. Now, we show that the reaction is acid&#8208;catalyzed and that the facile crystallization of the monomers is enabled by their distinctly low solubility. The highly ordered supramolecular architecture present in the monomer crystals provides ideal steric conditions for the formation of intermolecular phosphodiester linkages between the cyclic nucleotide units.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Amino Acids in Pharmaceutical Industry: Synthetic Approaches to Aza&#8208;Tryptophan Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17510-17528, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review profiles five tailor&#8208;made amino acids, aza&#8208;tryptophan derivatives, which include aza&#8208;substitution in positions 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the aromatic rings of tryptophan. The synthesis, medicinal chemistry and biological properties, and most promising applications of these aza&#8208;tryptophan are discussed.







Abstract
Over the recent years there has been a noticeable upsurge of interest in aza&#8208;analogs of tryptophan which are isosteric to the latter and found numerous applications in medicinal, bioorganic chemistry, and peptide research. In the present review article, five aza&#8208;tryptophan derivatives are profiled, including aza&#8208;substitution in the positions 2, on the five&#8208;membered ring, as well as in positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the six&#8208;membered ring. A detailed and comprehensive literature overview of the synthetic methods for the preparation of these aza&#8208;tryptophans is presented and general facets of the biological properties and most promising applications are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;This review profiles five tailor-made amino acids, aza-tryptophan derivatives, which include aza-substitution in positions 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the aromatic rings of tryptophan. The synthesis, medicinal chemistry and biological properties, and most promising applications of these aza-tryptophan are discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the recent years there has been a noticeable upsurge of interest in aza-analogs of tryptophan which are isosteric to the latter and found numerous applications in medicinal, bioorganic chemistry, and peptide research. In the present review article, five aza-tryptophan derivatives are profiled, including aza-substitution in the positions 2, on the five-membered ring, as well as in positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the six-membered ring. A detailed and comprehensive literature overview of the synthetic methods for the preparation of these aza-tryptophans is presented and general facets of the biological properties and most promising applications are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Studies of CO2&#8208;Reducing Metalloenzymes</title>

Only two enzymes are able to directly reduce CO2: the metalloenzymes formate dehydrogenase, which produces formate, and CO dehydrogenase, which produces carbon monoxide. We review studies in which these enzymes were connected to electrodes, either for applicative purposes or to learn about their catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Only two enzymes are capable of directly reducing CO2: CO dehydrogenase, which produces CO at a [NiFe4S4] active site, and formate dehydrogenase, which produces formate at a mononuclear W or Mo active site. Both metalloenzymes are very rapid, energy&#8208;efficient and specific in terms of product. They have been connected to electrodes with two different objectives. A series of studies used protein film electrochemistry to learn about different aspects of the mechanism of these enzymes (reactivity with substrates, inhibitors&#8230;). Another series focused on taking advantage of the catalytic performance of these enzymes to build biotechnological devices, from CO2&#8208;reducing electrodes to full photochemical devices performing artificial photosynthesis. Here, we review all these works.

         <title>Photoluminescence&#8208;Based Techniques for the Detection of Micro&#8208; and Nanoplastics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17529-17541, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detection of micro&#8208; and nanoplastics (MNPs) lacks recognized quality&#8208;controlled protocols and consequently also of related legislation. Here, photoluminescence&#8208;based techniques that can represent a solution are discussed. Nile Red staining is now the most used strategy, but also recently proposed molecular and nanostructured fluorogenic probes (biocompatible and water soluble) are presented.







Abstract
The growing numbers related to plastic pollution are impressive, with ca. 70&#8201;% of produced plastic (&gt;350&#8197;tonnes/year) being indiscriminately wasted in the environment. The most dangerous forms of plastic pollution for biota and human health are micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;plastics (MNPs), which are ubiquitous and more bioavailable. Their elimination is extremely difficult, but the first challenge is their detection since existing protocols are unsatisfactory for microplastics and mostly absent for nanoplastics. After a discussion of the state of the art for MNPs detection, we specifically revise the techniques based on photoluminescence that represent very promising solutions for this problem. In this context, Nile Red staining is the most used strategy and we show here its pros and limitations, but we also discuss other more recent approaches, such as the use of fluorogenic probes based on perylene&#8208;bisimide and on fluorogenic hyaluronan nanogels, with the added values of biocompatibility and water solubility.

         <title>Synergistic Peptide and Gold Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Branched Aldehydes to Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17559-17564, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a tripeptide and a gold complex catalyzes the enantioselective addition between branched aldehydes and allenamides to furnish synthetically versatile &#947;,&#948;&#8208;enamide aldehydes with a fully substituted stereogenic center. Mechanistic studies offered key insights into the role of the peptide and acid/base additives.







Abstract
The combination of a peptide catalyst and a gold catalyst is presented for enantioselective addition reactions between branched aldehydes and allenamides. The two catalysts act in concert to provide &#947;,&#948;&#8208;enamide aldehydes bearing a fully substituted, benzylic stereogenic center &#8211; a structural motif common in many natural products and therapeutically active compounds &#8211; with good yields and enantioselectivities. The reaction tolerates a variety of alkyl and alkoxy substituted aldehydes and the products can be elaborated into several chiral building blocks bearing either 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208; functional group relationships. Mechanistic studies showed that the conformational features of the peptide are important for both the catalytic efficiency and stereochemistry, while a balance of acid/base additives is key for ensuring formation of the desired product over undesired side reactions.

         <title>Metal Free Access to Polysubstituted Pyrimidines via Nitrile Activation and [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>

Nitriles were activated in presence of Tf2O into aza&#8208;allene species followed by an intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This process was evidenced by detailed deuteration experiments and competing reactions. A bidentate pyrimidine ligand was synthesized for preparation of a metal complex with pure blue luminescence at 470&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tf2O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidines and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf2O, aza&#8208;allene species were generated in&#8197;situ through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments. The reaction had good substrate extensibility with moderate to excellent yield including trimethylsilylalkynes. The method was utilized as a synthetic tool in the preparation of a luminescent metal complex.

         <title>Diastereoselective [2+2+1] Hydrative Annulation of Phenol&#8208;Linked 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Acetylenes Through Rhodium Catalysis: A Rapid Access to Cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols</title>

         <dc:description>
A unique [2+2+1] annulation of phenol&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes intercepted by hydration is uncovered using catalytic cationic Rh(I) for a facile and modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quaternary stereocenters. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination.







Abstract
An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A unique [2+2+1] annulation&lt;/b&gt; of phenol-linked 1,6-enynes with terminal alkynes intercepted by hydration is uncovered using catalytic cationic Rh(I) for a facile and modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quaternary stereocenters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6-enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5-membered rhoda-cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H-shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2-rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda-cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Conversion of a Au9Ag12 into a AuxAg16&#8208;x Nanocluster via Bisphosphine Ligand Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 70, Page 17554-17558, December 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via ligand engineering with Dppe, a non&#8208;fluorescent [Au9Ag12(SAdm)4(Dppm)6Cl6](SbF6)3 is reconstructed into a [AuxAg16&#8208;x(SAdm)8(Dppe)2] with aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Furthermore, chiral nanoclusters AuxAg16&#8208;x(SAdm)8(R/S&#8208;Dbpb)2 are obtained with chiral ligand Dbpb. This work provides guidance for the construction of novel clusters by etching clusters with multidentate phosphine ligands.







Abstract
The [AuxAg16&#8208;x(SAdm)8(Dppe)2] nanocluster with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) was synthesized from a non&#8208;fluorescent [Au9Ag12(SAdm)4(Dppm)6Cl6](SbF6)3 nanocluster via a ligand&#8208;exchange engineering (Dppe=1,2&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, Dppm=Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, HSAdm=1&#8208;Adamantanethiol). The nanocluster has a Au&#8208;doped icosahedral AuxAg13&#8208;x core, capped by two Ag(SR)3, one Ag(SR)2 and two Dppe ligands. By changing the achiral Dppe ligand into a chiral dbpb ligand ((2S,3S)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)butane or (2R,3R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;2,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)butane), chiral nanoclusters are obtained. ESI&#8208;MS and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were performed to track the reaction. This work provides guidance for the construction of new clusters by etching clusters with multidentate phosphine ligands.

         <title>Ring Opening Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactam in Superacidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/  M  F  5  (  M  &#160;=&#160;Sb,&#160;As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8209;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]. In presence of water traces, the diprotonated species of  &#946;  &#8208;alanine [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, in case of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  , single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted. By using SO  2  instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NHSO][SbF  6  ]  2  was obtained, and a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from  N  &#8209;protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, and the MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, respectively, were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam.</dc:description>

         <title>How 5&#8201;f Electron Polarisability Drives Covalency and Selectivity in Actinide N&#8208;Donor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N versus O donor: Isostructural complexes [An(pyren)2] (An=Th, U&#8211;Pu) with a pyrrole&#8208;based ligand (pyren) were synthesised and compared to the structural relative salen. Solid&#8208;state analysis and quantum chemical calculations reveal an increased bond strength to the imine nitrogen when changing the second donor from the dominant O to the softer N. In the complexes, the overall bond strength of salen exceeds pyren, except for the Pa case. This can be explained by a greater degree of polarizability for the Pa 5&#8201;f1 state. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. M&#228;rz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102849).

         <title>Direct Superacid&#8208;Promoted Difluoroethylation of Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an original superelectrophile&#8208;promoted difluoroethylation in superacid, CF2&#8208;Me aromatic amines can be synthesized directly and regioselectivity. Applied to simple substrates, natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients, this method offers an alternative for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of aryl methyl ethers bioisosters.







Abstract
Under superacid conditions, aromatic amines are directly and regioselectively 1,1&#8208;difluoroethylated. Low temperature in situ NMR studies confirmed the presence of benzylic &#945;&#8208;fluoronium and &#945;&#8208;chloronium ions as key intermediates in the reaction. This method has a wide substrate scope and can be applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Rearrangements in Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Uranium(IV) Thio&#8208; and Selenoether Complexes: Syntheses, Structures, and Computational Investigation of U&#8722;ER2 Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranium&#8212;selenoether linkages have been accessed for the first time, enabling the study of U&#8722;SeR2 versus U&#8722;SR2 and U&#8722;OR2 bonding. The shape of the uranium selenoether complex resembles a butterfly, and the cover art depicts a metamorphosis from the protio&#8208;ligand (caterpillar), to the potassium salt of the ligand (chrysalis), to the uranium complex (butterfly).

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes Bearing Axially Chiral Bipyridyls: The Mismatched Diastereomer Showed Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RutheniumII complexes bearing axially chiral bipyridyls were synthesized, and matched (more relaxed) &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and mismatched (more constrained) &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer was nonluminescent. In contrast, the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited vivid red circularly polarized phosphorescence. For the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the cumulative CH/&#960; interactions seem to suppress further distortion in the T1 state.







Abstract
RutheniumII complexes bearing three axially chiral bipyridyl ligands were synthesized as a new family of chiral complex dyes, and &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggested that all the bipyridyls maintained chirality in both the ground and excited states, and the &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomers are the matched (more relaxed) and mismatched (more constrained) pairs, respectively. The mismatched &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited red circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) both in solution and in the solid state. The solution state CPP is the most intense of ruthenium complexes, while the solid state CPP is the first example of them. It is supposed that, for the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the six cumulative CH/&#960; interactions suppress further distortion in the T1 state.

         <title>Two Faces of the Same Coin: Coupling X&#8208;Ray Absorption and NMR Spectroscopies to Investigate the Exchange Reaction Between Prototypical Cu Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed investigation of the reduction of the octahedral Cu(terpyridine)22+ complex to the tetrahedral Cu(neocuproine)2+ complex using the chemical fuel 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as reductant, has been carried out by exploiting an innovative mechanistic tool based on the complementarity of X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies coupled with Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analys.







Abstract
The satisfactory rationalization of complex reactive pathways in solution chemistry may greatly benefit from the combined use of advanced experimental and theoretical complementary methods of analysis. In this work, we combine X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analyses to gain a comprehensive view on a prototypical reaction involving the variation of the oxidation state and local structure environment of a selected metal ion coordinated by organic ligands. Specifically, we investigate the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid reduction of the octahedral complex established by the Cu2+ ion with terpyridine to the tetrahedral complex formed by Cu+ and neocuproine. Through our interdisciplinary approach we gain insights into the nature, concentration time evolution and structures of the key metal (XAS measurements) and organic (1H NMR measurements) species under reaction. We believe our method may prove to be useful in the toolbox necessary to understand the mechanisms of reactive processes of interest in solution.

         <title>New Palladium &#8211; ZrO2 Nano&#8208;Architectures from Thermal Transformation of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for Carbonylative Suzuki and Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 nanocomposites, obtained by direct pyrolysis of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under nitrogen or air, presented high ability to form benzophenone according to carbonylative Suzuki pathway under 1&#8197;atm of CO with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1. Pd/ZrO2 nanocomposites are superior catalysts of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Its morphology was preserved during the catalytic reaction.







Abstract
The new nanocomposites, Pd/C/ZrO2, PdO/ZrO2, and Pd/PdO/ZrO2, were prepared by thermal conversion of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2 (MOF) in nitrogen or air atmosphere. The presence of Pd nanoparticles, uniformly distributed on the ZrO2 or C/ZrO2 matrix, was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman and X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) methods. All pyrolysed composites retained the shape of the MOF template. They catalyze carbonylative Suzuki coupling under 1&#8197;atm CO with an efficiency significantly higher than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2. The most active PdO/ZrO2 composite, formed benzophenone with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1, while by using Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2, much lower TOF values, 51&#8211;95&#8197;h&#8722;1, were achieved. After the reaction, PdO/ZrO2 was recovered with the same composition and catalytic activity. Very good results were also obtained in the transfer hydrogenation of benzophenones to alcohols with Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation.

         <title>Chiral Dinuclear Eu(III), Tb(III), and Y(III) Complexes Supported by P&#8208;Stereogenic Linear Tetraphosphine Tetraoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A  P  &#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (  R,R  )&#8208; or (  S,S  )&#8208;dpmppm(=O)  4  , was synthesized to prepare  C  2  dinuclear M(hfa)  3  complexes (M = Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with  P  &#8208;chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)  3  complexes (M = Eu, Y) with a  P  &#8208;chiral diphosphine oxide, tpdpb(=O)  2  , were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the Eu(III) complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the  P  &#8208;chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)  3  units through intramolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene:&#160;Photophysical Properties and Solid State Intermolecular Interactions of Radially Arranged, Congested Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Planes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives, containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of a two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited state dynamic behavior occurring between the three radially arranged anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with a ca. 3.0 &#197; distances between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradation of herbicides by a plant nonheme iron dioxygenase: mechanism and selectivity of substrate analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogs by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C  2  &#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the  R  &#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.</dc:description>

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 10  7  M  &#8208;1  and large exothermicities &#916;  H  &#176; of &#8208;14 kcal/mol in a 120 mM K  +  buffer at 40 &#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline.

Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted  N  5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quadruplex-duplex (Q-D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q-D hybrid with a hairpin-type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;-outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ-5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high-affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex-duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 10  7  M  -1  and large exothermicities &#916;  H  &#176; of -14 kcal/mol in a 120 mM K  +  buffer at 40 &#176;C. Determination of the ligand-bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ-5 between 3&#8217;-outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;-&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ-5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non-substituted  N  5-methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q-D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8208;H activation for cysteine bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8208;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Bonding Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8208;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy) 3  2+  ) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03 &#956;M to 300 &#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013 &#181;M (3&#963;/ m  ). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging of a Perylene Moiety Enables a RuII Photosensitizer with Long&#8208;Lived Excited States and the Efficient Production of Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

With perylene we can: The incorporation of an additional perylene dye enables the creation of a novel multichromophoric RuII photosensitizer that exhibits a strong absorptivity in the visible as well as a unique excited&#8208;state behavior. Moreover, this complex was found to efficiently generate singlet oxygen upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Multichromophoric systems based on a RuII polypyridine moiety containing an additional organic chromophore are of increasing interest with respect to different light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel RuII photosensitizer, namely [(tbbpy)2Ru((2&#8208;(perylen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthrolline))](PF6)2 RuipPer, that includes a merged perylene dye in the back of the ip ligand. This complex features two emissive excited states as well as a long&#8208;lived (8&#8197;&#956;s) dark state in acetonitrile solution. Compared to prototype [(bpy)3Ru]2+&#8208;like complexes, a strongly altered absorption (&#1013;=50.3&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 467&#8197;nm) and emission behavior caused by the introduction of the perylene unit is found. A combination of spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy was used to elucidate the nature of the excited states. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully used for the efficient formation of reactive singlet oxygen.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic Stereotriads Featuring Fluorinated Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence of two unprecedented steps is described to build acyclic stereotriads bearing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter. The sequence combines a highly diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction from readily available starting materials with an acylative double organocatalyzed kinetic resolution (DoCKR) providing enantioenriched products. This method is practically simple, general, and flexible affording different diastereomers depending on the initial substrates. A mechanistic study supports the observed stereochemistry of fluorinated products.







Abstract
Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction directly generates a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5).

         <title>Solvothermal Synthesis of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with Magnetically Frustrated [Cr7S8]5+ Double&#8208;Cubes**

Novel compound, [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O was synthesized by using DMSO as a source of sulfur in solvothermal synthesis. Crystal structure is composed of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]3+ units connected into 2D layers by bridging ethylenediamine ligands. Magnetic interactions between Cr3+ centers in [Cr7S8]5+ core units were studied using magnetometry and DFT calculations. Strong antiferromagnetic coupling was observed in the peripheral Cr3 triangles as well as between central and peripheral Cr atoms of the Cr7 cluster leading to high degree of frustration.







Abstract
A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with [Cr7S8]5+ dicubane cationic clusters, has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (en) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi&#8208; and monodentate coordination modes; in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8&#8197;K, a highly negative Weiss constant, &#952;=&#8722;224(2)&#8197;K, obtained from Curie&#8208;Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility, suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between S=3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2S+1)7=16384 microstates from seven Cr3+ centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be J1=&#8722;21.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;30.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr3+ center and the peripheral Cr3+ ions of the dicubane cluster. The best simulation of the experimental data was obtained with J1=&#8722;20.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;21.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, in agreement with the slightly stronger AFM exchange within the triangles of the peripheral Cr3+ ions as compared to the AFM exchange between the central and peripheral Cr3+ ions. This compound is proposed as a synthon towards magnetically frustrated systems assembled by linking dicubane transition metal&#8208;chalcogenide clusters into polymeric networks.

To overcome the limits of the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)(benzene)]+ have been used to prepare sandwich complexes [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+. NMP is used to promote the substitution of naphthalene with simple arenes as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin. This compound can be used to unambiguously confirm the radioactive sandwich complexes [99mTc(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;arene sandwich complexes are generally prepared by the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, which conditions are incompatible with most O&#8208; and N&#8208; functional groups. We report a new way for the synthesis of sandwich type complexes [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+ from [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+, with functionalized arenes and pharmaceuticals. N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (NMP) facilitates the substitution of naphthalene with the incoming arene. A series of fully characterized rhenium sandwich complexes with simple arenes, such as aniline, as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin are presented. With these rhenium compounds in hand, the radioactive sandwich complexes [99mTc(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+ (pharm=pharmaceutical) can be unambiguously confirmed. The direct labelling of pharmaceuticals with 99mTc through &#951;6&#8208;coordination to phenyl rings and the confirmation of the structures with the rhenium homologues opens a path into molecular theranostics.

         <title>Photobase&#8208;Driven Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in a Strapped &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>

         <dc:description>
A pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore acts as a photobase to induce strap&#8208;to&#8208;&#960; excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) from a strapped ammonium moiety. This new design of an ESIPT fluorophore, which is suitable for use in acidic media, produces a significantly red&#8208;shifted orange emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.







Abstract
We report a new design strategy for an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore that can be used in acidic media. A photobasic pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore is combined with a basic trialkylamine &#8220;strap&#8221;. In the presence of an acid, protonation occurs predominantly at the amine moiety in the ground state. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a pre&#8208;organized intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure between the resulting ammonium moiety and the pyridine ring. Upon excitation, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transition increases the basicity of the pyridine moiety in the excited state, resulting in proton transfer from the amine to the pyridine moiety. Consequently, the fluorophore takes on a polymethine&#8208;dye character in the ESIPT state, which gives rise to significantly red&#8208;shifted emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Characterising a Weak Halogen Bond in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very weak halogen bonds are excessively difficult to characterise in solution. We present an approach for the detailed NMR spectroscopic description of very weak interactions, providing the solution ensemble of the flexible model compound, the accurate geometry of the binding sites and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters. Here NOE abbreviates nuclear Overhauser effect, RDC corresponds to residual dipolar coupling, and &#916;T indicates variable temperature experiments.







Abstract
Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution.

     alt="Pushing the Limits of Characterising a Weak Halogen Bond in Solution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Very weak halogen bonds&lt;/b&gt; are excessively difficult to characterise in solution. We present an approach for the detailed NMR spectroscopic description of very weak interactions, providing the solution ensemble of the flexible model compound, the accurate geometry of the binding sites and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters. Here NOE abbreviates nuclear Overhauser effect, RDC corresponds to residual dipolar coupling, and &#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; indicates variable temperature experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detection and characterisation of very weak, non-covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non-fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE- and RDC-based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;, &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; and &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ/pp structures of mercury oxides. The Hg&#8722;Hg bond of OHgHgO is shorter than that of HgHgO, similar to the Hg+(CN)2 system. Besides the broad absorption at &#8764;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 of &#8722;(HgO)n&#8722; in reactions of Hg and O2, HgO appeared at 521.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1, compared to 828.0 and 619.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for PtO and AuO. The band at 676&#8197;cm&#8722;1 observed in reactions of Hg and O3 was assiged to HgHgO.







Abstract
An investigation of pulsed&#8208;laser&#8208;ablated Zn, Cd and Hg metal atom reactions with HCN under excess argon during co&#8208;deposition with laser&#8208;ablated Hg atoms from a dental amalgam target also provided Hg emissions capable of photoionization of the CN photo&#8208;dissociation product. A new band at 1933.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in the region of the CN and CN+ gas&#8208;phase fundamental absorptions that appeared upon annealing the matrix to 20&#8197;K after sample deposition, and disappeared upon UV photolysis is assigned to (Ar)nCN+, our key finding. It is not possible to determine the n coefficient exactly, but structure calculations suggest that one, two, three or four argon atoms can solvate the CN+ cation in an argon matrix with C&#8722;N absorptions calculated (B3LYP) to be between 2317.2 and 2319.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Similar bands were observed in solid krypton at 1920.5, in solid xenon at 1935.4 and in solid neon at 1947.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. H13CN reagent gave an 1892.3 absorption with shift instead, and a 12/13 isotopic frequency ratio&#8211;nearly the same as found for 13CN+ itself in the gas phase and in the argon matrix. The CN+ molecular ion serves as a useful infrared probe to examine Ng clusters. The following ion reactions are believed to occur here: the first step upon sample deposition is assisted by a focused pulsed YAG laser, and the second step occurs on sample annealing: (Ar)2++CN&#8594;Ar+CN+&#8594;(Ar)nCN+.

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rearrange and aromatise: After a thiourea derivative has been transformed to a benzothiazine heterocycle, thioquinoline heterocycles can be formed by gold catalysis. The stability of the products is represented by the low level in the railway, while the gold catalysis will help to overcome the energetic barrier represented by the mountains. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Salvador and M.&#8197;C. Gimeno (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103439).

         <dc:description>
We have successfully isolated the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), which is an intermediate in the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and Si(OMe)4. By analyzing the reaction mechanism based on the reactivity of 1 and DFT calculations, we improved the catalytic system and synthesized various organic carbamates&#8212;including polyurethane raw materials&#8212;by using CO2 at 1&#8197;atm.

         <title>Being Positive is Not Everything &#8211; Experimental and Computational Studies on the Selectivity of a Self&#8208;Assembled, Multiple Redox&#8208;State Receptor that Binds Anions with up to Picomolar Affinities</title>

         <dc:description>
The interaction of a redox&#8208;active trinuclear, self&#8208;assembled Ru metallomacrocycle with oxo&#8208;anions is reported and its affinity for these anions and halides in different oxidation states is calculated, revealing both high affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for some guests) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1). Detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies on the host in each of its oxidation states, revealed that it binds anion guests by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions, including charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The interaction of the self&#8208;assembled trinuclear ruthenium bowl 13+, that displays three other accessible oxidation states, with oxo&#8208;anions is investigated. Using a combination of NMR and electrochemical experimental data, estimates of the binding affinities of 14+, 15+, and 16+ for both halide and oxo&#8208;anions were derived. This analysis revealed that, across the range of oxidation states of the host, both high anion binding affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for specific guests bound to 16+) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) were observed. As the crystal structure of binding of the hexafluorophosphate anion revealed that the host has two potential binding sites (named the &#945; and &#946; pockets), the host&#8208;guest properties of both putative binding sites of the bowl, in all of its four oxidation states, were investigated through detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies. These studies revealed that, due to the interplay of ion&#8208;ion interactions, charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, binding to the &#945; pocket is generally preferred, except for the case of the relatively large and lipophilic hexafluorophosphate anionic guest and the host in the highest oxidation states, where the &#946; pocket becomes relatively favourable. This analysis confirms that host&#8208;guest interactions involving structurally complex supramolecular architectures are driven by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions and, even in the case of charged binding pairs, simple ion&#8208;ion interactions alone cannot accurately define these recognition processes.

         <title>Tuning peptide structure and function through fluorobenzene stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides was developed. This enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with  ortho  ,  meta  or  para  relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant difference in potency and efficacy demonstrates how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n = 6, 4, and 2): Focusing on the effect of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups</title>

         <dc:description>The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C 18  ) precursors, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), are studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It is found that C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8208;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960; out  and &#960; in  ) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C 18  . However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) compared to C 18  . Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960; in  system, and the &#960; out  system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) with larger n  shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960; out  electron delocalization in the C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) and C 18  in terms of gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 4 and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120 &#181;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200 &#181;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2.

This example uses only 120 &#181;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self-assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200 &#181;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high-throughput and label-free method for studying enzyme-ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;Ru(II) polypyridine complex for targeted antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize clinical application of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), one of the most arduous challenges is how to render aPDT agents a high selectivity against bacterial pathogens. In light of the fact that amino group&#8208;containing lipids are rich on the outer surfaces of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, we herein constructed an alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;ruthenium (II) polypyridine complex (  Ru2  ) to preferentially label  Staphylococcus aureus  and methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) over mammalian cells via the amino&#8208;yne bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Thanks to the strong singlet oxygen generation ability,  Ru2  could photo&#8208;inactivate  S. aureus  and MRSA effectively and specifically. phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules also exist in mammalian cells but are not accessible for  Ru2  , leading to its poor binding/uptake and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark and upon irradiation towards mammalian cells as well as low hemolysis, all favorable for aPDT application.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 3  10  helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. Yet, the screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus.  1  H and  19  F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their  N  &#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 3  10  &#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle  19  F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@hydrogel system for antibacterial therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Here, we propose an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained&#8208;release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) was loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8211;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assemblies with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent supramolecular assembly systems with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties for the detection of analytes including metal ions, anions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and heparin are summarized according to their unique architectures, diverse functions, outstanding sensitivity, and excellent selectivity as sensing platforms. Furthermore, the additional advantages of the marriage between supramolecular assemblies and AIE features are highlighted, and opportunities, challenges, and development perspectives of the particular combination are also discussed.







Abstract
The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.

A pinch of binder, a pinch of MOF: The effect of co&#8208;extruding aluminium fumarate with either clays or silica gel binders has been investigated. Textural, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques show the changes in porosity and surface sites, and CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms fitted an ideal Jensen&#8208;Seaton adsorption model. We have demonstrated the viability of extrusion for MOF extrudate formation and the changes associated to the process.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminium fumarate MOF with clays or SiO2 gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO2 selectivity towards CH4, of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process. Moreover, probe FTIR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Think globally, act locally: The trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of aromaticity is demonstrated for a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic furans of various sizes. Whereas smaller macrocycles are planar, larger macrocycles distort out of planarity, thereby avoiding global antiaromaticity, and display increasing character of local aromaticity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by O. Gidron et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103536).

Hydrogen bonding is a fundamental interaction in daily life and plays an important role in chemical, physical, and biochemical processes. This work presents a metastable acid&#8211;base crystalline material whose luminescence color varies between green and yellow depending on the strength of the hydrogen bonds. The two single crystal structures shown were revealed in detail by neutron structural analysis and modern computational chemistry. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Ono, Y. Hisaeda, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103044).

         <title>Z&#8208;scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction for boosting photo&#8208;oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide under ambient conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In  2  S  3  show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalysis property is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalysis reveal that the superoxide radical (&#8226;O  2  &#8208;  ) and singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis, Configurational Assignment and Biological Evaluations of the Lipid Mediator RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  , an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a  Z  &#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  methyl ester in 13% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of  S. aureus  and zymosan A bioparticles.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on utilizing two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activity for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. While bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced utilizing dual ligands in the whole   domino  process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ylide&#8208;stabilized phosphenium cations: Impact of the substitution pattern on the coordination chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Here, we report the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]  +  (with Y = Ph  3  PC(Ph), R = Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties. While the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y  2  P]  +  formed the expected LAuCl]  +  complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from enantiomeric helic[6]arenes, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes is developed, which subsequently provided a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes in almost quantitative yields. Moreover, the chirality transfer in the chiral [1]rotaxanes is also observed.







Abstract
Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combined with DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competition rules! &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#8208;germylated phosphorus ylides of the general formula R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 bearing one chloride substituent on the group 14 element were synthesized and fully characterized. Chloride abstraction reactions provided access to dimeric or monomeric cations featuring a high fluoride ion affinity despite the relatively strong Cylide&#8722;E interaction with high double bond character.







Abstract
The synthesis and full characterization of &#945;&#8208;silylated (&#945;&#8208;SiCPs; 1&#8211;7) and &#945;&#8208;germylated (&#945;&#8208;GeCPs; 11&#8211;13) phosphorus ylides bearing one chloride substituent R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 (R=Ph; R1=Me, Et, Ph; R2=Me, Et, iPr, Mes; E=Si, Ge) is presented. The molecular structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The title compounds were applied in halide abstraction studies in order to access cationic species. The reaction of Ph3PC(Me)Si(Cl)Me2 (1) with Na[B(C6F5)4] furnished the dimeric phosphonium&#8208;like dication [Ph3PC(Me)SiMe2]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (8). The highly reactive, mesityl&#8208; or iPr&#8208;substituted cationic species [Ph3PC(Me)SiMes2][B(C6F5)4] (9) and [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) could be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Carrying out the halide abstraction reaction in the sterically demanding ether iPr2O afforded the protonated &#945;&#8208;SiCP [Ph3PCH(Et)Si(Cl)iPr2][B(C6F5)4] (6&#8201;dec) by sodium&#8208;mediated basic ether decomposition, whereas successfully synthesized [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) readily cleaves the F&#8722;C bond in fluorobenzene. Thus, the ambiphilic character of &#945;&#8208;SiCPs is clearly demonstrated. The less reactive germanium analogue [Ph3PC(Me)GeMes2][B{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}4] (14) was obtained by treating 11 with Na[B{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}4] and fully characterized including by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Structural parameters indicate a strong CYlide&#8722;Ge interaction with high double bond character, and consequently the C&#8722;E (E=Si, Ge) bonds in 9, 10 and 14 were analyzed with NBO and AIM methods.

         <title>Tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine: The Simplest Non&#8208;ionic Phosphorus Superbase and Strongly Donating Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline phosphorus superbase tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine is accessible through an easy and scalable procedure starting from cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals. The properties of the strongly electron&#8208;donating phosphine in coordination chemistry and the reactivity with small molecules (CO2, SO2, N2O and elemental chalcogens) were studied.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)3, a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)3 with N2O and the elemental chalcogens.

         <title>An H2O2 Molecule Stabilized inside Open&#8208;Cage C60 Derivatives by a Hydroxy Stopper</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives enabled the complete isolation of a single H2O2 molecule as the stable peroxosolvate in the solid state. Crystallographic and computational analyses revealed that the arrangement of the hydroxy group and intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization of the H2O2 molecule.







Abstract
An H2O2 molecule was isolated inside hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives by mixing an H2O2 solution with a precursor molecule followed by reduction of one of carbonyl groups on its orifice. Depending on the reduction site, two structural isomers for H2O2@open&#8208;fullerenes were obtained. A high encapsulation ratio of 81&#8201;% was attained at low temperature. The structures of the peroxosolvate complexes thus obtained were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray analysis, and DFT calculations, showing strong hydrogen bonding between the encapsulated H2O2 and the hydroxy group located at the center of the orifice. This OH group was found to act as a kinetic stopper, and the formation of the hydrogen bonding caused thermodynamic stabilization of the H2O2 molecule, both of which prevent its escape from the cage. One of the peroxosolvates was isolated by HPLC, affording H2O2@open&#8208;fullerene with 100&#8201;% encapsulation ratio, likely due to the intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer of ionic transition metal complex promotes electron injection and transport, resulting in an improved carrier balance of green CsPbBr3 perovskite/iTMC light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). The optimized external quantum efficiency reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for perovskite LECs so far.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Assignment of (&#8722;)&#8208;Fusaequisin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constitutional reassignment and configurational assignment of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A, an irregularly assembled polyketide from the ascomycete Fusarium equiseti, was accomplished by total synthesis. Structural assignment fuels the proposition that Podospora curvicolla (order Sordiales) and Fusarium equiseti (order Hypocreales) possess a common biosynthetic machinery to produce polyketides of solitary architecture.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Fusaequisin A is an irregularly assembled polyketide isolated from the ascomycete Fusarium equiseti. Fusaequisin A shares a carbon backbone with curvicollide C from the ascomycete Podospora curvicolla but its absolute configuration remained hitherto unsettled. Herein, we document the total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A and its 4&#8208;O&#8208;desmethyl derivative following a central&#8208;to&#8208;lateral building block strategy. Catalytic asymmetric Claisen rearrangement, Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination and olefin cross&#8208;metathesis served as key C/C&#8208;connecting transformations. The constitution and absolute configuration of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A was deduced and the original structural assignment was adjusted.

         <title>Afterglow Implant for Arterial Embolization and Intraoperative Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glowing implant: The study developed a photochemical afterglow implant displaying more than one order of magnitude enhancement in afterglow emission compared with its nanoparticle counterparts. This implant exhibits a long lifetime, the ability to quickly transform into gel, and the ability to eliminate background interference. These features make the implant an excellent candidate for embolic agents and monitoring the effect of embolization.







Abstract
Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is wildly used in clinical treatments. However, the online monitoring of the thrombosis formation is limited due to the challenges of the direct visualization of embolic agents and the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic blood flow. Thus, we developed a photochemical afterglow implant with strong afterglow intensity and a long lifetime for embolization and imaging. The liquid pre&#8208;implant injected into the abdominal aorta of mice was rapidly transformed into a hydrogel in&#8197;situ to embolize the blood vessel. The vascular embolism position can be observed by the enhanced afterglow of the fixed implant, and the long lifetime of afterglow can also be used to monitor the effect of embolization. This provides an excellent candidate in bio&#8208;imaging to avoid the autofluorescence interference from continuous light excitation. The study suggests the potential usefulness of the implant as an embolic agent in TAE and artery imaging during a surgical procedure.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Terminal vs. Fluorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Allenamides via Addition of Diazo Compounds to Terminal Ynamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuI&#8208;catalyzed robust synthesis of N&#8208;allenamides from ynamides by the reaction with various diazo&#8208;compounds was developed. DFT calculations showed that this transformation relies on an uncommon, reversed mechanism that, regardless of the polarization of the ynamide, favors the addition of the diazo compound at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide. The protocol tolerates a wide range of functional groups. This copper&#8208;catalyzed process represents the first synthesis of tri&#8208;, di&#8208; or per&#8208;fluorinated N&#8208;allenamides from ynamides.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;mediated coupling reaction between ynamides and diazo&#8208;compounds to produce N&#8208;allenamides is reported for the first time. This method enables facile and rapid access to terminal N&#8208;allenamides by using commercially available TMS&#8208;diazomethane with wide functional group compatibility on the nitrogen. Furthermore, the ubiquity of molecules containing a fluorine moiety in medicine, in agricultural, and material science requires the continuous search of new building blocks, including this unique surrogate. The CuI/diazo protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;substituted N&#8208;allenamides. DFT calculations provided insights in the mechanism involved.

         <title>Highly Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodeuteration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;&#8208;bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom or heterocycle containing substrates. The base&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation induced emission leading to white light emission in diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8208;A groups or energy transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Calixarenes incorporating sulfonamide moieties: versatile ligands for carbonic anhydrases inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki  values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and Molecular Modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of the Conformational Space of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Quadruplex RG&#8208;1 by Cellular Components and the Amyloidogenic Peptides &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and hIAPP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid&#8208;19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG&#8208;1 RNA&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N&#8208;gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type&#8208;II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG&#8208;1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG&#8208;1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid-19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G-quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG-1 RNA-G-quadruplex of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;-Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG-1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG-1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies. These results may therefore shed more light on the relationship between PD as well as T2DM and the SARS-CoV-2 disease and their molecular underpinnings. Since dysregulation of G4Q formation by rationally designed targeting compounds affects the control of cellular processes, this study should contribute to the development of specific ligands for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Olefin Metathesis in Confinement: Towards Covalent Organic Framework Scaffolds for Increased Macrocyclization Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer vast structural and chemical diversity enabling a wide and growing range of applications. While COFs are well&#8208;established as heterogeneous catalysts, so far, their high and ordered porosity has scarcely been utilized to its full potential when it comes to spatially confined reactions in COF pores to alter the outcome of reactions. Here, we present a highly porous and crystalline, large&#8208;pore COF as catalytic support in a,w&#8208;diene ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions, leading to increased macrocylization selectivity. COF pore&#8208;wall modification by immobilization of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8208;type catalyst via a mild silylation reaction provides a molecularly precise heterogeneous metathesis catalyst. An increased macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) selectivity over oligomerization (O) for the heterogeneous COF&#8208;catalyst (MMC:O = 1.35) of up to 51% compared to the homogeneous catalyst (MMC:O = 0.90) was observed along with a substrate&#8208;size dependency in selectivity, pointing to diffusion limitations induced by the pore confinement.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group&#160;P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is p&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P.&#160;In situ&#160;studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the reaction of Piers' borane, i.e. HB(C 6 F 5 ) 2 , with an excess of arylacetylenes at room temperature leads to tetramerization of the acetylene and the diastereoselective formation of boryl&#8208;substituted tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes. The reaction mechanism was investigated by isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations. These investigations indicate that a series of 1,2&#8208;carboboration reactions form an octatetraene that undergoes an electrocyclization. Two skeletal rearrangements then presumably lead to the formation of the tetrahydropentalene core. Overall, this intricate and unprecedented transformation comprises five carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations in a single reaction.</dc:description>

Abstract
This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library through a Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) approach employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR process gives access to skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an in&#8197;situ generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The products were analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and the cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing N,C&#8208;palladacycles through regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane-derived annulated 3-amino-imidazole ligand library through a Groebke-Blackburn-Bienaym&#233; three-component reaction (GBB-3CR) approach employing formyl-cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB-3CR process gives access to skeletally-diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3-amino-imidazo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridines and imidazo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazines. Additionally, a one-pot protocol for the GBB-3CR by an in&#8197;situ generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The products were analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and the cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single-crystal X-Ray crystallography.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Perfluoroalkylation of Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient process for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides is reported in this work. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.







Abstract
An efficient and broadly applicable process is reported for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes including benzofurans, benzothiophenes, (aza)indoles, furans and pyrroles. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the efficiency and robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Tin/Tin Oxide/CNT Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial structure of Pt&#8722;Sn/SnOx/CNT composite electrocatalysts was rationally engineered on carbon nanotubes for achieving high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. Through a carefully designed two&#8208;step (oxidation&#8208;reduction) heat&#8208;treatment route, the coverage of SnOx thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnOx. The optimized PtSn&#8722;SnOx interface showed significantly improved performances toward ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self&#8208;poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well&#8208;designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two&#8208;step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnOx interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt&#8722;Sn and formation of PtSn&#8722;SnOx interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnOx thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnOx. The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnOx species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti&#8208;poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H&#8722;PtSn/SnOx/CNT&#8208;2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn&#8722;SnOx interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825&#8197;mA&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). This study provides deep insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.

         <title>Missing Member in the MIIMIIISi4N7 Compound Class: Carbothermal Reduction and Nitridation Synthesis Reveal Substitution of Nitrogen by Carbon and Oxygen in CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx]:Eu2+/Ce3+ (x&#8776;0.3)</title>

Carbon copy: The oxonitridocarbidosilicate CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) has been synthesized by carbothermal reduction and nitridation. Incorporation of carbon was confirmed by 13C and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. Complementary EDX measurements suggest that simultaneous incorporation of oxygen compensates for the negative charge excess induced by carbon. Eu2+&#8208; and Ce3&#8208;doped CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) exhibit yellow&#8208;green and blue emission, respectively.







Abstract
The nitridosilicate CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) was synthesized by carbothermal reduction and nitridation starting from CaH2, Lu2O3, graphite and amorphous Si3N4 at 1550&#8201;&#176;C in a radiofrequency furnace. CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) crystallizes isotypically to many previously known MIIMIIISi4N7 compounds in the space group P63mc, as was confirmed by Rietveld refinement based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Incorporation of carbon into the crystal structure as a result of the carbothermal synthesis route was confirmed by 13C and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. For the first time in the MIIMIIISi4N7 compound class, complementary EDX measurements suggest that simultaneous incorporation of oxygen compensates for the negative charge excess induced by carbon, resulting in an adjusted sum formula, CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3). When excited with UV&#8208;to&#8208;blue light, CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) shows an emission maximum in the blue spectral region (&#955;em=484&#8197;nm; fwhm=4531&#8197;cm&#8722;1) upon doping with Ce3+, whereas Eu2+&#8208;doped CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) exhibits a yellow&#8208;green emission (&#955;em=546&#8197;nm; fwhm=3999&#8197;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Europium is Different: Solvent and Ligand Effects on Oxidation State Outcomes and C&#8208;F Activation in Reactions Between Europium Metal and Pentafluorophenylsilver</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ovoid EuII cage with a rare &#956;4&#8208;pyrazolate binding including an &#951;5&#8208;(N2C3)&#8208;Eu bond is reported. Solvent and ligand variations affect the oxidation state outcomes, and the synthesis features the first C&#8722;F activation by AgC6F5 in redox transmetallation/protolysis (RTP) reactions.







Abstract
Unique outcomes have emerged from the redox transmetallation/ protolysis (RTP) reactions of europium metal with [Ag(C6F5)(py)] (py=pyridine) and pyrazoles (RR&#8242;pzH). In pyridine, a solvent not normally used for RTP reactions, the products were mainly EuII complexes, [Eu(RR&#8242;pz)2(py)4] (RR&#8242;pz=3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazolate (Ph2pz) 1; 3&#8208;(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolate (ttfpz) 2; 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpyrazolate (PhMepz) 3). However, use of 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazole (tBu2pzH) gave trivalent [Eu(tBu2pz)3(py)2] 4, whereas the bulkier N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)formamidine (DFFormH) gave divalent [Eu(DFForm)2(py)3] 5. In tetrahydrofuran (thf), the usual solvent for RTP reactions, C&#8722;F activation was observed for the first time with [Ag(C6F5)(py)] in such reactions. Thus trivalent [{Eu2(Ph2pz)4(py)4(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2}{Eu2(Ph2pz)4(py)2(thf)4(&#956;&#8208;F)2}] (6), [Eu2(ttfpz)4(py)2(dme)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (7), [Eu2(tBu2pz)4(dme)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (8) were obtained from the appropriate pyrazoles, the last two after crystallization from 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (dme). Surprisingly 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole (Me2pzH) gave the divalent cage [Eu6(Me2pz)10(thf)6(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (9). This has a compact ovoid core held together by bridging fluoride, thf, and pyrazolate ligands, the last including the rare &#956;4&#8208;1&#951;5(N2C3): 2&#951;2(N,N&#8242;): 3&#954;(N): 4&#954;(N&#8242;) pyrazolate binding mode. With the bulky N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)formamidine (DippFormH), which often favours C&#8722;F activation in RTP reactions, neither oxidation to EuIII nor C&#8722;F activation was observed and [Eu(DippForm)2(thf)2] (10) was isolated. By contrast, Eu reacted with Bi(C6F5)3 and Ph2pzH or tBu2pzH in thf without C&#8722;F activation, to give [Eu(Ph2pz)2(thf)4] (11) and [Eu(tBu2pz)3(thf)2] (12) respectively, the oxidation state outcomes corresponding to that for use of [Ag(C6F5)(py)] in pyridine.

Making the switch: This work disclosed the use of the Cu&#8722;Cu interaction of a mixed&#8208;valent tetrametallic copper complex (C&#8208;1) with a N&#8722;O&#8208;N Schiff base ligand for the generation of photoactive nanoscale copper [LCu0n, S&#8208;1] that showed stimuli (O2/light)&#8208;responsive switchable performance between its reduced (S&#8208;1) and oxidized [LCu0n&#8722;mCuOm, S&#8208;2] states, which serve as highly and poorly active (bistate, relative rate &gt;5&#8208; to 12&#8208;fold) catalyst to control two different antagonistic reactions.







Abstract
A discrete, photoactive, ultrafine copper nanocluster of fewer than hundreds of atoms with stimuli&#8208;responsive switchable redox&#8208;active states is highly desired to control two different antagonistic reactions. Herein, a mixed&#8208;valent tetrametallic copper complex (C&#8208;1) of N&#8722;O&#8208;N Schiff base ligand is disclosed, in which the five different Cu&#8722;Cu interactions were used to generate photoactive nanoscale copper [LCu0n, S&#8208;1] through the reduction of coordinated imine to the amine of C&#8208;1. The presence of a ligand provides stability and helps to homogenize the material (S&#8208;1) in the organic solvent. The cluster showed stimuli (O2/light)&#8208;responsive switching between its reduced (S&#8208;1) and oxidized [LCu0n&#8722;mCuOm, S&#8208;2] states that allows it to serve as a highly and poorly active (bistate, relative rate &gt;5&#8211;12 fold) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes and hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to amino aromatics under the light.

         <title>The Significant Influence of a Second Metal on the Antiproliferative Properties of the Complex [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)]</title>

The coordination of a second metal (Zn, Co, or Ni) to a monometallic [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)] complex, which is obtained from deprotonation of [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(HdmoPTA)](OSO2CF3), had a significant influence and increased antiproliferative activity. Moreover, the bis&#8208;metallic complexes are selective as no reduction in normal cell viability is observed in their presence. On the other hand, the complexes display different properties and mechanisms of action depending on the nature of the second metal, M.







Abstract
Complexes [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(HdmoPTA)](OSO2CF3) (1), [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)] (2) and [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;dmoPTA&#8208;1&#954;P:2&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;MCl2] (M=Zn (3), Co (4), Ni (5), dmoPTA=3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,7&#8208;triaza&#8208;5&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques. The crystal structures of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco&#8208;2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol. The monometallic ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were found to be inactive, but the bimetallic complexes 3, 4 and 5 display an increased activity (IC50 3: 9.07&#177;0.27, 4: 5.40&#177;0.19, 5: 7.15&#177;0.30&#8197;&#956;M) compared to cisplatin (IC50=45.6&#177;8.08&#8197;&#956;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of the complexes, such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies, were performed. The results showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH3NdmoPTA atoms.

The monometallic ruthenium complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were found to be inactive, but the bimetallic complexes &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; display an increased activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;: 9.07&#177;0.27, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;: 5.40&#177;0.19, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;: 7.15&#177;0.30&#8197;&#956;M) compared to cisplatin (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=45.6&#177;8.08&#8197;&#956;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of the complexes, such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies, were performed. The results showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;dmoPTA&lt;/sub&gt; atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulation of Electrocatalytic Activity by Local Microstructure: Focusing on the Catalytic Active Zone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored catalysts: Traditional design methods of catalytic active sites have successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in catalytic activity. The concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and helps develop new methodologies to control the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions. This review provides the research progress of this strategy in electrocatalytic reactions, with the emphasis on their important applications in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR).







Abstract
Traditional regulation methods of active sites have successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in the catalytic activity. Unlike the conventional viewpoint of focusing on single active site, the concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and new methods to regulate the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions are developed accordingly. The local microstructure active zone refers to the zone with high catalytic activity formed by the interaction between active atoms and neighboring coordination atoms as well as the surrounding environment. Instead of the traditional single active atom site, the active zone is more suitable for the actual electrochemical reaction process. According to this concept, the activity of electrocatalysts can be coordinated by multiple active atoms. This strategy is beneficial for understanding the relationship between material, structure, and catalysis, which realizes the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. This review provides the research progress of this strategy for electrocatalytic reactions, with emphasis on their applications in oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction.

         <title>Fe&#8208;ZIF8 Coating Cu Foil Derived Carbon as A pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;universal electrocatalyst (Cu/Fe&#8722;NC) with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance is fabricated by pyrolyzing Fe&#8208;ZIF8 coated commercial Cu foil. Profiting from the synergistic effect of electronic distribution (such as Cu&#8594;Fe) and textual structure, the prepared Cu/Fe&#8722;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;cell (positive onset and half&#8208;wave potential) and zinc&#8208;air battery (high discharge voltage and good stability) performances to commercial Pt/C electrodes.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to fabricate highly efficient pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a facile strategy, which includes coating the Fe modified ZIF8 on Cu foil and in&#8197;situ pyrolysis to evaporate and dope Cu into the MOF derived carbon, is developed to fabricate Fe/Cu&#8722;N co&#8208;doped carbon material (Cu/Fe&#8722;NC). Profiting from the modulated electron distribution and textual properties, well&#8208;designed Cu/Fe&#8722;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.923&#8197;V in alkaline, 0.757&#8197;V in neutral and comparable 0.801&#8197;V in acid electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ultralow peroxides yield of ORR demonstrates the high selectivity of Cu/Fe&#8722;NC in full pH scale electrolytes. As expected, the self&#8208;made alkaline and neutral zinc&#8208;air batteries equipped with Cu/Fe&#8722;NC cathode display excellent discharge voltages, outstanding peak power densities and remarkable stability. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient and pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for ORR through strategy of Fe/Cu&#8722;N co&#8208;doping, Cu foil evaporation and carbon defects capture.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Dual&#8208;Responsive Iridium Probe for Saccharide Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal sensing: A luminescent iridium(III) complex, designed with boronic acid groups closely coupled to the metal centre, responds to sugar binding upon optical and electrochemical stimuli. The orange iridium luminescence signal is quenched by sugar binding in aqueous solutions at physiological pH. The signal is also observed in cancer cells, and is quenched by sugars at concentrations mimicking blood plasma. Hydrogel matrices with incorporated iridium complex retain the sensing response to sugars, providing an exemplar transition metal complex for saccharide&#8208;responsive devices.







Abstract
Dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in sensing systems and in&#8197;vitro testing. We introduce an IrIII complex with a boronic acid receptor site attached to the 2&#8208;phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo&#8208; and electrochemical signals that is sensitive to monosaccharide binding in aqueous solution. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618&#8197;nm, which is reduced by 70 and 40&#8201;% upon binding of fructose and glucose, respectively. The electro&#8208;chemiluminescent signal of the complex also shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The IrIII complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices as in solution, thus demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a nontoxic, simple&#8208;to&#8208;use tool to observe sugar binding over physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations. Moreover, the complex's luminescence is responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells.

         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of allylic difluorides with aryl iodides was achieved via allylic C&#8722;F bond activation. Based on this protocol, a series of &#947;&#8208;arylated monofluoroalkenes were synthesized in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;I bonds of the aryl iodides and the C&#8722;F bonds of the allylic difluorides were cleaved via oxidative addition and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination, respectively.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene to benzotriazoles catalyzed by stable univalent copper of Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites is presented. A Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposite of stable univalent copper was prepared and used for a new catalytic synthesis strategy to synthesize a series of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties. In this strategy, there is no need to add other ligands and co&#8208;catalysts, the reaction time is short, the yield of products is high, and the catalyst can be reused many times without adding other related ligands and cocatalyst.







Abstract
With the development of green chemistry, it is still a challenge to maintain the unstable valence state of the metal in heterogeneous catalysts and realize new catalytic synthesis methods. In this paper, it is reported that an univalent copper nanocomposite (Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15) can efficiently catalyze the formation of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties in a new synthetic strategy. Subsequently, its application is further verified by an acylation reaction to produce a series of novel benzotriazoles derivatives with high yield. It is worth noting that the Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites not only enable the reaction completed with high yield in a short time, but can also be recycled many times without a significant reduction in activity, and the leaching of copper and aluminum species in reaction system is negligible. Finally, the detailed and feasible reaction mechanism is also provided.

         <title>Mn12&#8208;Acetate Complexes Studied as Single Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn12O12(RCOO)16 complexes have been the guinea pigs of research on single molecular magnets in the bulk and on surfaces before. Here, novel XMCD studies of isolated ionic samples with same Mn12 scaffolds yield magnetic fingerprints much like bulk samples. Advanced computations of single ion tensors find high anisotropies only on the outer MnIII8 ring. Intrinsic magnetic properties of the Mn12 scaffold seem robust against the environment.







Abstract
The phenomenon of single molecule magnet (SMM) behavior of mixed valent Mn12 coordination clusters of general formula [MnIII8MnIV4O12(RCOO)16(H2O)4] had been exemplified by bulk samples of the archetypal [MnIII8MnIV4O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (4) molecule, and the molecular origin of the observed magnetic behavior has found support from extensive studies on the Mn12 system within crystalline material or on molecules attached to a variety of surfaces. Here we report the magnetic signature of the isolated cationic species [Mn12O12(CH3COO)15(CH3CN)]+ (1) by gas phase X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy, and we find it closely resembling that of the corresponding bulk samples. Furthermore, we report broken symmetry DFT calculations of spin densities and single ion tensors of the isolated, optimized complexes [Mn12O12(CH3COO)15(CH3CN)]+ (1), [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16] (2), [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (3), and the complex in bulk geometry [MnIII8MnIV4O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (5). The found magnetic fingerprints &#8211; experiment and theory alike &#8211; are of a remarkable robustness: The MnIV4 core bears almost no magnetic anisotropy while the surrounding MnIII8 ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn12 core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.

         <title>Crystal Channel Engineering for Rapid Ion Transport: From Nature to Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion transport behaviours through cell membranes are commonly identified in biological systems, which are crucial for sustaining life for organisms. Similarly, ion transport is significant for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Rapid ion transport can be well achieved by crystal channels engineering, such as creating pores or tailoring interlayer spacing downwards nanometres or even sub&#8208;nanometre scales. Furthermore, some functional channels, such as ion selective channels and stimulus&#8208;responsive channels, are developed for smart ion storage applications. In this review, the typical ion transport phenomena in the biological systems, including ion channels and pumps, are first introduced, and then ion transport mechanisms in solid and liquid crystals are comprehensively reviewed, particularly for the widely studied porous inorganic/organic hybrid crystals and ultrathin inorganic materials. Subsequently, recent progress on the ion transport properties in electrodes and electrolytes is reviewed for rechargeable batteries. Finally, current challenges in the ion transport behaviours in rechargeable batteries are analysed and some potential research approaches, such as bioinspired ultrafast ion transport structures and membranes, are proposed for future studies. It is expected that this review can give a comprehensive understanding on the ion transport mechanisms within crystals and provide some novel design concepts on promoting electrochemical ion storage capability in rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C60 dyad as a photosensitizer for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C  60  dyad (  BP&#8208;C  60  ) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatments and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications.  BP&#8208;C  60  is constituted by a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a fullerene C  60  moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. BOPHY core works as a visible light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C  60  subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8208;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C  60  . Photodynamic studies indicate that  BP&#8208;C  60  produces ROS by both photomechanisms (Type I and Type II), even it presents a higher ROS production efficiency than its constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models demonstrated the capability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C  60  dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency and relatively low cost. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in&#8208;situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.</dc:description>

The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state-of-the-art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in-situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacially Super&#8208;Assembled Benzimidazole Derivative&#8208;Based Mesoporous Silica Nanoprobe for Sensitive Copper (II) Detection and Biosensing in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with benzimidazole&#8208;derived fluorescent molecules (DHBM) are fabricated via a feasible interfacial superassembly strategy for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu  2+  . DHBM&#8208;MSN have an obvious quenching effect on Cu  2+  in aqueous solution, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10  &#8208;8  M. The DHBM&#8208;MSN solid&#8208;state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that using particles with different morphologies as carriers does not affect the specific detection function of nanoprobes. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental and density flooding theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu  2+  in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. The results indicate that the DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8211;Iodide Complex on Catalytically Active SiO2 Surface for One&#8208;pot Hydrosilylation&#8211;CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N  +  I  &#8208;  ) on SiO  2  . The SiO  2  &#8208;supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex, in the presence of ammonium cations, could be effectively  used for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxyolefins, hydrosilanes, and CO  2  . The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the reaction carried out for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N  +  I  &#8208;  ), respectively. The mechanism of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co&#8208;immobilized N  +  I  &#8208;  , was investigated using the Rh and I K&#8208;edge XAFS and XPS techniques. Analysis of the XAFS profiles indicated the presence of the Rh&#8211;I bond. The curve&#8208;fitting analysis of the Rh K&#8208;edge EXAFS profiles suggests the dissociation of the 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (COD) ligand from the Rh center. Results from spectroscopic and kinetic analyses revealed that the high activity of the catalyst (during hydrosilylation) could be attributed to the decrease in the steric hindrance and the electron&#8208;rich sate of the Rh. The decrease in the steric hindrance could be attributed to the absence of COD and the electron&#8208;rich state promoted the oxidative addition of Si&#8208;H. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example for the one&#8208;pot silylcarbonate synthesis as well as determination of a novel surface Rh&#8208;iodide complex and its catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoter&#8208;driven overexpression in Chromobacterium vaccinii facilitates access to FR900359 and yields novel low abundance analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), a selective Gq/11 protein inhibitor of high pharmacological interest and a potential lead molecule for targeted therapy of cancers with oncogenic GNAQ or GNA11 mutations (encoding Gq and G11 respectively), has been challenging ever since its initial discovery more than three decades ago. The recent discovery of Chromobacterium vaccinii as a cultivable FR producer enables the development of approaches leading to a high&#8208;yielding, scalable and sustainable biotechnological process for production of FR, thereby removing this bottleneck. Here we characterize different promoters in exchange of the native promoter of the FR assembly line, resulting in an overexpression mutant with significantly increased production of FR. Thereby, the isolation and structure elucidation of novel FR analogs of low abundance is enabled. Further, we explore the antiproliferative activities of fifteen chromodepsins against uveal melanoma cell lines harboring Gq/11 mutations and characterize the major metabolite of FR formed in plasma.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilisation of CO2 as &#8220;Structure Modifier&#8221; of Inorganic Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilisation of CO  2  as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule&#8217;s inherent chemical stability. However, CO  2  reacts promptly at high temperature (~1000 &#176;C) with alkaline&#8208;earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re&#8208;utilisation. In this work, this concept is extended and CO  2  is utilised as a reagent to modify the crystal structure of mixed&#8208;metal inorganic solids. Modification of the crystal structure is a &#8220;tool&#8221; used by materials scientists to tailor the physical property of solids. CO  2  gas was reacted with several isostructural mixed&#8208;metal oxides Sr  2  CuO  3  , Sr  1.8  Ba  0.2  CuO  3  and Ba  2  PdO  3  . These oxides are carefully selected to show anion vacancies in their crystal structure, to act as host sites for CO  2  molecules, leading to the formation of carbonate anions, (CO  3  )  2&#8722;  . The corresponding oxide carbonates were formed successfully and the favourable formation of SrCO  3  as secondary phase was minimised via an innovative, yet simple synthetic procedure involving alternating of CO  2  and air. We also derived a simple model to predict the kinetics of the reactions for the cuprates, using first&#8208;principles density functional theory and assimilating the reaction to a gas&#8211;surface process.</dc:description>

         <title>Lights and Shadows of DMSO as Solvent for Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 2020 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ever&#8208;present solvent for tin halide perovskites, was identified as an oxidant for Sn  II  . Nonetheless, alternatives are lacking and few efforts have been devoted to replacing it. To understand this trend it is indispensable to learn the importance of DMSO on the development of tin halide perovskites. Its unique properties have allowed processing compact thin&#8208;films to be integrated into tin perovskite solar cells. Creative approaches for controlling the perovskite crystallization or increasing its stability to oxidation have been developed relying on DMSO&#8208;based inks. However, increasingly sophisticated strategies appear to lead the field to a plateau of power conversion efficiency in the range of 10&#8208;15%.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2020 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ever-present solvent for tin halide perovskites, was identified as an oxidant for Sn  II  . Nonetheless, alternatives are lacking and few efforts have been devoted to replacing it. To understand this trend it is indispensable to learn the importance of DMSO on the development of tin halide perovskites. Its unique properties have allowed processing compact thin-films to be integrated into tin perovskite solar cells. Creative approaches for controlling the perovskite crystallization or increasing its stability to oxidation have been developed relying on DMSO-based inks. However, increasingly sophisticated strategies appear to lead the field to a plateau of power conversion efficiency in the range of 10-15%. And, while DMSO-based formulations have performed in encouraging means so far, we should also start considering their potential limitations. In this concept article, we discuss the benefits and limitations of DMSO-based tin perovskite processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Release of Molecular Cargo from Polymer Systems by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and manipulation of (multi)functional materials at the nanoscale holds the promise of fueling tomorrow&#8217;s major technological advances. In the realm of macromolecular nanosystems, the incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, so called mechanophores, has resulted in unprecedented access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. Among the diverse force&#8208;activated motifs, the on&#8208;demand release or activation of compounds, such as catalysts, drugs, or monomers for self&#8208;healing, are sought&#8208;after since they enable triggering pristine small molecule function from macromolecular frameworks. Here, we highlight examples of molecular cargo release systems from polymer&#8208;based architectures in solution by means of sonochemical activation by ultrasound (ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemistry). Important design concepts of these advanced materials are discussed, as well as their syntheses and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically synthesized, self&#8208;assembling small interfering RNA&#8208;prohead RNA molecules trigger Dicer&#8208;independent gene silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery  in vivo  . An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA&#8208;3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway  via  Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA&#8208;3WJs are substrates for Dicer  in vitro  . However, our results reveal that siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2&#8208;deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8217; of the 3WJ (5&#8217;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8217; of the 3WJ (3&#8217;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ). This work sheds light on the functional properties of siRNA&#8208;3WJs and offers a design rule for maximizing their potency in the human RNAi pathway.</dc:description>

Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid&#8208;phase synthesis furnished 12&#8208;mer oligonucleotides which were hybridized.

CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and spacious click adducts are well accommodated in grooves of anomeric DNA.

         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  1  &#8208;methylation of pseudouridine (m  1  &#968;) replaces uridine in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m  1  &#968; is compared to that of uridine using photoirradiation at 267 nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m  1  &#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer  1  &#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both nucleosides decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m  1  &#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than uridine following irradiation at 267 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Heme&#8208;Iron&#8208;Mediated Selective Halogenation of Unactivated Carbon&#8722;Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slowly, but surely: The iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a chloride in cis position to the oxido group is an excellent model for non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron halogenases: it activates the very strong C&#8722;H bonds of cyclohexane and selectively leads to the halogenated product. Although it is the fastest iron(IV)&#8208;oxido model system known, formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting is the dominating reaction, and the halogenation itself therefore is a relatively slow but still selective process.







Abstract
Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L1)FeIICl2], where L1 is a tetradentate bispidine, with soluble iodosylbenzene (sPhIO) leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a cis disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands, as observed in non&#8208;heme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, the halogenation being initiated by C&#8722;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl&#8722;. The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from sPhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to &gt;70&#8201;% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe2+ and Fe3+ in comparison with [(L1)FeIICl2] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ is the most reactive small&#8208;molecule halogenase model, that the FeIII/radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime (as supported by experimentally observed cage escape), and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product; this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fragile Diva: Trienone units and the elimination&#8208;prone hydroxy groups render pulvomycin D a capricious target, the total synthesis of which required a subtle endgame strategy, including a Heck reaction (3) and a sequential release of six silyl protecting groups combined with a Peterson elimination reaction (4). Earlier key steps of the synthesis included a diastereoselective aldol reaction (1) and a regioselective Yamaguchi esterification (2).







Abstract
A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetra&#173;fluoro&#173;tetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;penta&#173;fluoro&#173;&#173;tetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk Mn2+ Doped 1D Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskite with Highly Efficient, Tunable and Stable Broadband Light Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn2+&#160;doped colloidal three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) has&#160;attracted intensive research attention, however, the low exciton binding energy and fatal optical instability of 3D PNC seriously hinder the optoelectronic application. Therefore, it remains significant to explore new stable host perovskite with strongly bound exciton to realize more desirable luminescent property. In this work, we utilized bulk one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid perovskite of [AEP]PbBr5&#8729;H2O (AEP = N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine) as structural platform to rationally optimize the luminescent property by controllable Mn2+&#160;doping strategy. Significantly, the serial Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D [AEP]PbBr5&#8729;H2O show enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the strongly bound excitons of host material to 3d&#160;electrons of Mn2+&#160;ions, resulting in tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range&#160;with highest photoluminescence quantum yield up to 28.41%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskite as excellent down&#8208;converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high&#8208;performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid&#8208;state lighting and displaying devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of Defect&#8208;rich Ternary NiCoFe Layered Double Hydroxides: Fine Modulation of Co3+ for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;abundance and durable layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the easy agglomeration of lamellar LDHs in the aqueous phase limits their practical applications. Herein, a series of ternary NiCoFe LDHs were successfully fabricated on nickel foam (NF)  via  a simple electrodeposition method. The as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF displayed an unique nanoarray structural feature. It showed an OER overpotential of 209 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  in alkaline solution, which was superior to most systems reported so far. As evidenced by the XPS and XAFS results, such excellent performance of Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF was attributed to the higher Co  3+  /Co  2+  ratio and more defects exposed, comparing with Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )&#8208;mono LDHs prepared by conventional coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the ratio of Co to Fe could significantly tune the Co electronic structure of Ni(Co  x  Fe  1&#8208;x  )/NF composites (x = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) and affect the electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF showed the lowest energy barrier for OER rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*). This work proposes a facile method to develop high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>
