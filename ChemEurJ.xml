      <title>Decorating Metal Nitrate with Coplanar Bipyridine Moiety: a Simple and General Method for Fabricating Photochromic Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>As a significant branch of photochromic materials, crystalline hybrid photochromic materials (CHPMs) have obtained widespread attention of researchers because of their possibilities of generating other photo&#8208;responsive properties and advantages in understanding the underlying relationship between structure and photo&#8208;responsive performance. The predesign of suitable ligands play a major role in generating desirable CHPMs. Hitherto, most of CHPMs are built from photo&#8208;deformable or photo&#8208;responsive tectons. However, the synthesis of these ligands is usually time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost, which greatly restrict their large&#8208;scale preparation and practical application. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to explore new families of CHPMs compared with the existing CHPMs. Herein, we report a simple and general method for constructing CHPMs via decorating metal nitrate with coplanar bipyridine moiety 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen). The resulting products exhibit apparent photo&#8208;coloration in response to Xe&#8208;lamp irradiation. The electron&#8208;transfer (ET) from the coplanar NO  3  &#8208;  species (as &#960;&#8208;electron donors, &#960;&#8208;EDs) to coplanar phen moieties (as &#960;&#8208;electron acceptors, &#960;&#8208;EAs) is responsible for the resulting photochromism. The influence of coordination environment and central metal ions on photochromism have also been studied. Our work has demonstrated that the introduction of coplanar organic tectons as &#960;&#8208;EAs to metal nitrate as &#960;&#8208;EDs under the collaboration of ET and coordination assembly strategies is a simple and general method to manufacture CHPMs.</dc:description>

      <title>Proton Switch in the Secondary Coordination Sphere to Control Catalytic Events at the Metal Center: Biomimetic Oxo Transfer Chemistry of Nickel Amidate Complex</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species are key intermediates for the oxygen atom transfer step in the catalytic cycles of many metalloenzymes. While the redox&#8208;active metal centers of such enzymes are typically supported by anionic amino acid side chains or porphyrin rings, peptide backbone itself might function as strong electron&#8208;donating ligands to stabilize high oxidation states. To test the feasibility of this idea in synthetic settings, we have prepared a nickel(II) complex of new amido multidentate ligand. The mononuclear nickel complex of this N5 ligand catalyzes epoxidation reactions of a wide range of olefins by using mCPBA as a terminal oxidant. Notably, a remarkably high catalytic efficiency and selectivity were observed for terminal olefin substrates. We found that protonation of the secondary coordination sphere serves as the entry point to the catalytic cycle, in which high&#8208;valent nickel species is subsequently formed to carry out oxo&#8208;transfer reactions. Conceptually parallel process could allow metalloenzymes to control the catalytic cycle in the primary coordination sphere by using proton switch in the secondary coordination sphere.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Directly Linked Dihydrodiazatetracene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we synthesized three types of 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,12&#8208;diazatetracene (DHDAT) dimers with different substitution patterns: a symmetric dimer with a C&#8211;C bond between the monomer units (  1  ) and two asymmetric dimers with a C&#8211;N bond between the monomer units (  2  and  3  ). The structure&#8208;property relationship of  1  &#8211;  3  were investigated. X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis revealed that the two DHDAT units are completely planar in the C&#8211;C linked dimer  1  whereas the monomer units are perpendicularly oriented in the C&#8211;N linked dimers  2  and  3  in the crystals. Reflecting their molecular structures, the electronic interaction between the two monomer units is larger in  1  and very little in  2  and  3  in the ground states. However, the emission behavior of  3  is remarkably different from those of other dimers and its monomer. The dimer  3  shows a clear positive solvatochromism in emission which is characteristic for electron donor&#8211;acceptor type molecules in spite of its donor&#8211;donor type structure. Furthermore, the dimer  3  exhibits a unique multi&#8208;step thermochromic emission behavior. The reason for the different emission behaviors can be attributed to the asymmetric distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of DHDAT.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning tetrazole photochemistry for protein ligation and molecular imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemistry provides a wide range of alternative reagents that hold potential for use in bimolecular functionalisation of proteins. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of metal ion binding chelates derivatised with disubstituted tetrazoles for the photoradiochemical labelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The photophysical properties of tetrazoles&#160;featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents&#160;to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395 nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and theaza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with&#160;89Zr,&#160;64Cu and&#160;68Ga radionuclides.&#160;DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with&#160;89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable&#160;in vitro&#160;and retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing human SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.</dc:description>

The photophysical properties of tetrazoles&#160;featuring extended aromatic systems and auxochromic substituents&#160;to tune excitation toward longer wavelengths (365 and 395 nm) were studied. Two photoactivatable chelates based on desferrioxamine B (DFO) and theaza&#8208;macrocycle NODAGA were functionalised with a tetrazole and developed for protein labelling with&#160;89Zr,&#160;64Cu and&#160;68Ga radionuclides.&#160;DFO&#8208;tetrazole (1) was assessed by direct conjugation to formulated trastuzumab and subsequent radiolabelling with&#160;89Zr. Radiochemical studies and cellular&#8208;based assays demonstrated that the radiotracer remained stable&#160;in vitro&#160;and retained high immunoreactivity. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were used to measure the tumour specific uptake and pharmacokinetic profile in mice bearing human SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer xenografts. Experiments demonstrate that tetrazole&#8208;based photochemistry is a viable approach for the light&#8208;induced synthesis of PET radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The mechanochemical synthesis of nanomaterials for catalytic applications is a growing research field due to its simplicity, scalability, and eco&#8208;friendliness.

Consequently, this research field has recently become highly popular, particularly for the preparation of catalytic materials for various applications, ranging from chemical production over energy conversion catalysis to environmental protection. In this review, recent studies on mechanochemistry for the synthesis of catalytic materials are discussed.

      <dc:description>
Rolling up: Larger acenes are potential carriers of diffuse interstellar bands, and should undergo dehydrogenation reactions upon absorption of interstellar UV photons. This could result in 2,3&#8208;didehydroacenes that have a reactive aryne functionality at one of the short ends of the long molecule. The intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to dihydroethenocyclacenes with the other end of the acene and the subsequent cycloreversion of acetylene were studied computationally and were shown to have energy requirements that are compatible with cyclacene formation under the extreme conditions of interstellar space.

      <title>Carbohydrate Derived Metal Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterial for advanced targeted delivery applications. Implementation of external stimuli controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. In this paper, we present the synthesis of a carbohydrate derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on Zn2+ presence: an active state in the presence of Zn2+ ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn2+ or when exposed to Na2EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn2+ ions. This is to our knowledge the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a single liposome study, we found that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes. Upon addition of EDTA to the liposomes, their fluorescent cargo could be released as a result of the membrane incorporated lipids undergoing a conformational change.</dc:description>

      <title>Mo2C/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity and Biocompatibility for Microbial Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>A simple, cost&#8208;effective strategy was developed to effectively improve the electron transfer efficiency as well as the power output of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) by decorating the commercial carbon paper (CP) anode with an advanced Mo  2  C/reduced graphene oxide (Mo  2  C/RGO) composite. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the superior electrocatalytic activity of Mo  2  C, the high surface area, and prominent conductivity of RGO, the MFC equipped with this Mo  2  C/RGO composite yields a remarkable output power density of 1747&#177;37.6 mW m  &#8208;2  , which is considerably higher than that of carbon paper MFC (CP&#8208;MFC) (926.8&#177;6.3) mW m  &#8208;2  ). Importantly, the composite also facilitates the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hybrid biofilm and could effectively improve the bacteria&#8211;electrode interaction. These features result in an enhanced coulombic efficiency up 13.2%, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the CP (1.2%).</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen Complexes of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Iodine complexes of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) act as electrophiles towards a variety of nucleophiles, with the interactions ranging from noncovalent charge&#8208;transfer or halogen bonding to covalent 3&#8208;center, 4&#8208;electron bonding. Hypervalent (10&#8208;X&#8208;2) bis(carbene)iodine(I) and &#8208;bromine(I) complexes could be isolated and structurally characterized, and computational studies reveal that London dispersion involving the bulky NHC ligands (R=Dipp, Mes) contributes significantly to the stability of these systems.

      <title>Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 as Catalyst for Amide Esterification</title>
      <dc:description>
Amide is one of the most robust groups, characterized by extreme inertness, represented here as laying in a hammock on the beach.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amide is one of the most robust groups&lt;/b&gt;, characterized by extreme inertness, represented here as laying in a hammock on the beach. Consequently, it will take ages to go up to the mountain together with butanol in the endeavor to get to the other side to become an ester. However, they can take the shortcut of a Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808&#8208;P catalyst (FESEM image), represented as a cave, which facilitates reaching the plateau on the other side of the mountain.

      <title>Inversion Symmetry Breaking in Order&#8211;Disorder Transitions of Globular Ligands Coordinating to Cobalt(II) and Nickel(II) Bisacetylacetonato Complexes During Heating</title>
      <dc:description>
Chirality generated by rotational motions: Unexpected inversion&#8208;symmetry breaking was observed in the order&#8211;disorder phase transitions of [M(acac)2(abco)2] (M=Co2+ and Ni2+) during heating. X&#8208;ray structure analysis and differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the 60&#176; step rotating disordering of the globular abco ligands induced local pseudo&#8208;symmetry to increase from trigonal to hexagonal, and the crystal symmetries were lowered to reduce the steric repulsion among them. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Hoshino and T. Akutagawa. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004492).

      <dc:description>
A dual photo&#8208;switch method produces four different hybridization states of duplexes by irradiation with a specific wavelength of light: 465&#8197;nm, 405&#8197;nm, 340&#8197;nm, and 300&#8197;nm. This photo&#8208;regulation system is based on a reversible photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction between two photo&#8208;responsive nucleobases in serinol nucleic acid strands.

A large entropy of proton solvation was used for thermoelectric conversion. A [Ru(Him)6] complex produces 3.7&#8197;mV at a temperature difference of 1&#8197;K. This ruthenium complex exhibits a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction and releases protons associated with the redox reaction. Its solvation entropy causes a shift in the redox equilibrium from the temperature difference. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Yamada et&#8197;al.

      <title>A Light&#8208;Harvesting/Charge&#8208;Separation Model with Energy Gradient Made of Assemblies of meta&#8208;Pyridyl Zinc Porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>
A light&#8208;harvesting antenna model made of three mutually axially coordinated zinc porphyrin molecules is reported in this work. With an energy gradient incorporated, energy transfer only occurs from porphyrin molecules specializing in light absorption to a porphyrin molecule as a charge separation center. The latter molecule is a directly linked porphyrin/ferrocene dyad. The image implies that the light energy is funneled into the lower energy porphyrin/ferrocene dyad with no unfavorable back energy transfer. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.

      <title>Temperature dependence of 1 H paramagnetic chemical shifts in actinide complexes, beyond Bleaney&#8217;s theory. The AnVIO22+ &#8722; DPA complexes (An = Np, Pu) as an example.</title>
      <dc:description>Actinide +VI complexes (An VI = U VI , Np VI and Pu VI ) with

dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by

powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In

addition, Np VI and Pu VI complexes were described by first principles

CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The

analysis of the 1 H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons

of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the

Fermi contact contribution is negligible. The magnetic susceptibility

tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217;

method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic

susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions

in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic

properties of the Np VI complex. The temperature dependence of the

pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 1 &#8260; T contribution, contrarily to

Bleaney&#8217;s theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the

temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID

magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Np VI

complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Pu VI complex

allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic

moments of the paramagnetic center.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Actinide +VI complexes (An VI = U VI , Np VI and Pu VI ) with

dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by

powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In

addition, Np VI and Pu VI complexes were described by first principles

CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The

analysis of the 1 H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons

of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the

Fermi contact contribution is negligible. The magnetic susceptibility

tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217;

method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic

susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions

in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic

properties of the Np VI complex. The temperature dependence of the

pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 1 &#8260; T contribution, contrarily to

Bleaney&#8217;s theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the

temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID

magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Np VI

complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Pu VI complex

allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic

moments of the paramagnetic center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Amorphous Boron Dispersed LaCoO3 with Large Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Catalytic Propane Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Unsatisfied oxygen mobility is a considerable barrier to the development of perovskite for the&#160;low&#8208;temperature volatile organic compounds (VOCs) oxidation. This work introduced small amounts of dispersed non&#8208;metal boron into LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal via an easy sol&#8208;gel method to create more oxygen defects, that are conducive to the catalytic performance of propane (C  3  H  8  ) oxidation. It reveals that moderate addition of boron successfully induces high&#160;distortion of LaCoO  3  &#160;crystal, decreases the perovskite particle size, and produces large proportion of bulk Co  2+  &#160;species corresponding to abundant oxygen vacancies. Besides, surface Co  3+  &#160;species, as the acid sites, that are active for cleaving C&#8208;H bond of C  3  H  8  &#160;molecule are enriched. As a result, the LCB&#8208;7 (molar ratio of Co: B = 0.93: 0.07) displays the best C  3  H  8  &#160;oxidation activity. Simultaneously, the above catalyst exhibits superior thermal stability against CO  2  &#160;and H  2  O for a lasting 200 h. This work provides a new strategy for modifying the catalytic VOCs oxidation performance of perovskites via the regulation&#160;of amorphous boron&#8208;dispersion.</dc:description>

      <title>A robust mesoporous Al2O3 based nanocomposite catalyst for abundant NOx storage with rational design of Pt and Ba species</title>
      <dc:description>The nanostructural design of heterogeneous catalysts has often been demanded for assessing synergetic effects, which should be developed further by using high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous metal oxide supports. However, such opportunities have been robbed by the less stability of ordered mesoporous structure.

      <title>Sensitive and visual detection of phosgene by a TICT&#8208;based BODIPY dye with 8&#8208;(o&#8208;hydroxy)aniline as the active site</title>
      <dc:description>Phosgene and its substitutes (diphosgene and triphosgene) are widely utilized as chemical industrial materials and chemical warfare agents and pose a threat to public health and environmental safety due to their extreme toxicity. Research efforts have been directed to develop selective and sensitive detection methods for phosgene and its substitutes. In this paper, we have prepared two BODIPY&#8208;based fluorescent probes,  o&#8208;Pah and  o&#8208;Pha, which are two isomers with different active sites,  ortho&#8208;aminohydroxy (3',4' or 4',3') phenyls at  meso  position of BODIPY, and compared their sensing performance toward triphosgene. The probe with  o  &#8208;(4'&#8208;amino&#8208;3'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pha, exhibits better sensing performance over the  o&#8208;(3'&#8208;amino&#8208;4'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pah, for instance, a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.34 nM  vs  1.2 nM), and more rapid response (10 s  vs  200 s). Furthermore, based on the above comparative studies, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe  o&#8208;Phae has been constructed through extending 3,5&#8208;conjugation of  o&#8208;Pha. The probe  o&#8208;Phae displays rapid response (60 s), high sensitivity to triphosgene (LOD = 0.88 nM), and high selectivity for triphosgene over relevant analytes including nitric oxide. Finally, a facile test strip for phosgene was fabricated by immobilizing  o&#8208;Phae in a polyethylene oxide membrane for sensitive (&lt; 2&#160;ppm) and selective detection of phosgene in the gas phase.</dc:description>

The probe with  o  &#8208;(4'&#8208;amino&#8208;3'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pha, exhibits better sensing performance over the  o&#8208;(3'&#8208;amino&#8208;4'&#8208;hydroxyl),  o&#8208;Pah, for instance, a lower limit of detection (LOD) (0.34 nM  vs  1.2 nM), and more rapid response (10 s  vs  200 s). Furthermore, based on the above comparative studies, a red&#8208;fluorescence probe  o&#8208;Phae has been constructed through extending 3,5&#8208;conjugation of  o&#8208;Pha. The probe  o&#8208;Phae displays rapid response (60 s), high sensitivity to triphosgene (LOD = 0.88 nM), and high selectivity for triphosgene over relevant analytes including nitric oxide. Finally, a facile test strip for phosgene was fabricated by immobilizing  o&#8208;Phae in a polyethylene oxide membrane for sensitive (&amp;lt; 2&#160;ppm) and selective detection of phosgene in the gas phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Perylenebisimide (PBI)&#8208;anthracene (AN) donor&#8208;acceptor dyads/triads are prepared to investigate spin orbit charge&#8208;recombination induced intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). Molecular conformation is controlled by connecting of PBI unit to either 2&#8208; and 9&#8208; position of anthryl moiety. Steady state, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption and emission spectroscopies reveal that chromophore orientation, electronic coupling and dihedral angle between donor and acceptor exert significant effect on photophysical property. The dyad PBI&#8208;9&#8208;AN with orthogonal geometry shows weak ground state coupling and efficient ISC (&#934;&#8710; = 86%) as compared to PBI&#8208;2&#8208;AN (&#934;&#8710; = 57%), the dyad showing more coplanar geometry. With nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, long&#8208;lived PBI localized triplet state was observed (&#964;T = 139 &#181;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of triplet state is sensitive to geometry and number of AN units attached to PBI. Reversible and stepwise generation of near IR&#8208;absorbing PBI radical anion (PBI&#8722;&#183;) and dianion (PBI2&#8722;) was observed upon photoexcitation in presence of triethanolamine, and it was confirmed that selective photoexcitation at the near IR absorption bands of PBI&#8722;&#183; is unable to produce PBI2&#8208;.</dc:description>

      <title>HNO to NO Conversion Mechanism via Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase (CuZnSOD), Comparison with Heme Protein Mediated Conversions, and Origin of the Questionable Reversibility</title>
      <dc:description>Conversion between NO and HNO via CuZnSOD is important in biomedicine and for HNO detection. Many mechanistic questions, including the decades&#8208;long debate on reversibility, were resolved in this work. Calculations of various active site and full protein models show that the basic mechanism is proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the computed barrier of 10.98 kcal/mol in excellent agreement with experiment (10.62 kcal/mol), and this non&#8208;heme protein mediated reaction has many significant mechanistic differences compared to the conversions mediated by heme proteins due to geometric and electronic factors. Reasons for the irreversible nature of this conversion and models with the first thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible mechanism for the experimental reverse reaction were discovered.

      <dc:description>A series of in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating Ru(II) precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands has been probed in the reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant. The catalytic production of propionate and acrylate silyl esters was evidenced by high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) and implemented in batch reactor techniques. The most promi&#8208;sing catalyst systems identified were made of Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,4&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane (DCPB) or 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;diyl&#8208;bis(cyclohexylphosphine) (DCPF). A marked influence of water on the acrylate/propionate selectivity was noted. Turnover numbers (TON, mol.mol(Ru)&#8722;1) up to 16 for acrylate and up to 68 for propionate were reached under relatively mild conditions (20 bar, 100 &#176;C, 0.5 mol% Ru, 40 mol% H2O vs. HSiEt3).

      <title>Parallel Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Strategy Based on Bimetal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Ferrotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between MOF layers with 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl disulphide as spacers. Under tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs via a glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide while erastin aggravated glutathione depletion to down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, which then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy which effectively inhibited tumor growth in living mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between MOF layers with 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl disulphide as spacers. Under tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs via a glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide while erastin aggravated glutathione depletion to down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, which then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy which effectively inhibited tumor growth in living mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component [4+2+1] Cycloaddition of Two Vinylallenes and CO</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [4+2+1] reactions of diene (or diene derivatives such as vinylallene), alkyne/alkene, and CO (or carbene) are expected to be the most straightforward approach to synthesize challenging seven&#8208;membered ring compounds, but so far only limited successes have been realized. Here we report an unexpected three&#8208;component [4+2+1] reaction between two vinylallenes and CO to give highly functionalized tropone derivatives under mild conditions, where one vinylallene acts as 4C synthon, the other vinylallene as 2C synthon and CO as 1C synthon. We propose that this reaction occurs via oxidative cyclization of diene part of one vinylallene molecule, followed by insertion of terminal alkene part of the allene moiety in another vinylallene, into the Rh&#8208;C bond of five&#8208;membered rhodacycle. Then CO insertions and reductive elimination give the [4+2+1] cycloadduct. Further experimental exploration of why ene&#8208;vinylallenes and CO gave monocyclic tropone derivatives instead of 6/7 products have also been reported here.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Co3O4/Carbon Heteroaerogels with Ultrahigh Capacitance via Polyethyleneimine&#8208;Intercalation of Co2BIM4 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>The development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based supercapacitors have attracted intense concentration in recent years due to their regularly arranged porous and tunable pore sizes. However, the performance of the MOFs derived supercapacitors is also low because of their poor electrical conductivity and rarely accessible active sites. In the present work, we develop a Co&#8208;MOF (namely Co 2  BIM 4  , BIM=benzimidazole) nanosheets derived Co 3  O 4  /nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC) heteroaerogel as a novel supercapacitor electrode. The 3D Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC heteroaerogels are obtained by directly intercalating polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the interlayers of Co 2  BIM 4  nanosheets, and following by carbonizing the resulting Co 2  BIM 4  /PEI composite. The Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC electrode possess 3D conductive framework with an overlapped hetero&#8208;interface and expanded interlayers, leading to fast and stable charge transfer/diffusion and enhanced pseudocapacitance performance. Therefore, the Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC electrode shows ultrahigh capacitance of 2568&#8201;F&#8201;g &#8722;1  at 1&#8201;A&#8201;g &#8722;1  , 1747&#8201;F&#8201;g &#8722;1  at 10&#8201;A&#8201;g &#8722;1  , and excellent long cycling time with a capacitance preservation of 92.7% following 10000 cycles at 10&#8201;A&#8201;g &#8722;1  , which is very promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.</dc:description>

      <title>The Relationship of William Henry Perkin, Jr. and Sir Robert Robinson: Teacher and Student, then Student and Teacher</title>
      <dc:description>
A productive collaboration: W.&#8197;H. Perkin, Jr. (left) and R. Robinson (right) had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. This Essay examines the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.







Abstract
William Henry Perkin, Jr. FRS, the son of the inventor of mauve and other commercial dyes and credited for initiating the industrialization of chemistry, was himself a notable chemist. He was the Professor of Organic Chemistry at Manchester from 1892&#8211;1912 and then was the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at Oxford and the first Head of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory from 1912&#8211;1929. One of Perkin's graduate students and research assistants at Manchester was Robert Robinson, subsequently Sir Robert Robinson, FRS and recipient of the 1947 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Perkin and Robinson had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. Upon Perkin's early death, Robinson succeeded him as the fourth Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, Oxford University. This Essay will examine the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.

      <title>Energetics of Formation of Cyclacenes from 2,3&#8208;Didehydroacenes and Implications for Astrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
n&#8208;Acenes (C4n+2H2n+4) are potential carrier candidates for diffuse interstellar bands. Their conversion into n&#8208;cyclacenes (C4nH2n) through UV photon&#8208;initiated dehydrogenation followed by Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition and acetylene expulsion appears energetically plausible. Analysis of the conversion through TAO&#8208;DFT reveals dependency of the energy barriers on ring strains of the primary n&#8208;cyclacene.







Abstract
The carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are still largely unknown although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon chains, and fullerenes are likely candidates. A recent analysis of the properties of n&#8208;acenes of general formula C4n+2H2n+4 suggested that these could be potential carriers of some DIBs. Dehydrogenation reactions of n&#8208;acenes after absorption of an interstellar UV photon may result in dehydroacenes. Here the reaction energies and barriers for formation of n&#8208;cyclacenes from 2,3&#8208;didehydroacenes (n&#8208;DDA) by intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to dihydro&#8208;etheno&#8208;cyclacenes (n&#8208;DEC) followed by ejection of ethyne by retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are analyzed using thermally assisted occupation density functional theory (TAO&#8208;DFT) for n=10&#8211;20. It is found that the barriers for each of the steps depend on the ring strain of the underlying n&#8208;cyclacene, and that the ring strain of n&#8208;DEC is about 75&#8201;% of that of the corresponding n&#8208;cyclacene. In each case, ethyne extrusion is the step with the highest energy barrier, but these barriers are smaller than CH bond dissociation energies, suggesting that formation of cyclacenes is an energetically conceivable fate of n&#8208;acenes after multiple absorption of UV photons.

      <title>Chemical Bonding as a New Avenue for Controlling Excited&#8208;State Properties and Excitation Energy Transfer Processes&#160;in Zinc Phthalocyanine&#8208;Fullerene Dyads</title>
      <dc:description>In this work we employ electronic structure and non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics methods to explore excited&#8208;state properties of covalently bonded zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8208;fullerene (C60) dyads with 6&#8208;6 [or 5&#8208;6] bonding configuration in which ZnPc is bonded to two carbon atoms shared by the two hexagonal rings [or a pentagonal and a hexagonal ring] in&#160;C60. In both cases, the locally excited (LE) states on ZnPc are spectroscopically bright. However, their different chemical bondings differentiate the electronic interactions between ZnPc and C60. In the 5&#8208;6 bonding configuration the LE states on ZnPc are much higher in energy than the LE states on C60. Thus, the excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to&#160;C60&#160;is thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, in the 6&#8208;6 bonding configuration such a process is inhibited because the LE states on ZnPc are the lowest ones. More detailed mechanisms are elucidated from non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics simulations. In the 6&#8208;6 bonding configuration, no excitation energy transfer has been observed. In contrast, in the 5&#8208;6 bonding configuration, several LE and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excitons have been identified to participate in the energy transfer process. Further analysis reveals that the photoinduced energy transfer is mediated by a CT exciton, such that electron and hole transfer processes take place in a concerted but asynchronous manner in the excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, the present work opens up new avenues for regulating excited&#8208;state properties of molecular donor&#8208;acceptor dyads by means of chemical bonding.</dc:description>

      <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended carbazole derivatives as host materials for highly efficient and long&#8208;life green phosphorescent OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance OLEDs that use phosphorescent and/or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are capable of realizing 100% electron&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion. The host materials in these OLEDs play crucial roles in determining OLED performance. Carbazole derivatives are frequently used as host materials, among which 3,3&#8208;di(9 H &#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208; yl)biphenyl ( mCBP ) is often used for lifetime testing in scientific studies. In this study, we expanded the&#160; p &#8208;conjugation of the carbazole unit to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely&#160; m1BTCBP&#160; and&#160; m4BTCBP . Among these host materials,&#160; m1BTCBP&#160; formed a highly efficient Ir(ppy) 3 &#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT 50 ) of over 300 h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000 cd m &#8211;2&#160; (current density: 25 mA cm &#8211;2 ). LT 50&#160; at 1000 cd cm &#8208;2&#160; is estimated to be about 23000 h. This performance is clearly greater than that of&#160; mCBP &#8208;based OLEDs (LT 50&#160; = ca. 8500 h).</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, Structure and Photophysical Properties of a New Class of Inherently Chiral Boron(III) Chelates &#8211; The tert&#8208;Leucine Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A new family of boron(III) chelates is introduced whereby molecular chirality, confirmed by circular dichroism, is imported during synthesis such that isolation of the diastereoisomers does not require separation procedures. The photophysical properties of two members of the family have been examined: the  N,O,O  &#8208;salicylaldehyde&#8208;based derivative shows pronounced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer character in fluid solution and is weakly fluorescent, with a large Stokes shift. The corresponding 2&#8208;methylamino&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8208;derived  N,N,O  &#8208;chelate absorbs and fluoresces in the visible region with a much smaller Stokes shift. Orange fluorescence is also observed for this compound as a cast film. Temperature&#8208;dependence studies show that decay of the fluorescent state is weakly activated but emission is less than quantitative at 77K. Quite rare for boron(III)&#8208;based chelates, this derivative undergoes intersystem crossing to form a  meta  &#8208;stable triplet&#8208;excited state. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are reported for both compounds, along with simulated ECD spectra.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide capture and utilization with isomeric forms of bis(amino)&#8208;tagged zinc bipyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Aiming at extending the tagged zinc bipyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) family, the ligand 3,3'&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyrazole (3,3'&#8208;H2L  ) has been synthesized in good yield. The reaction with zinc(II) acetate hydrate led to the related MOF  Zn(3,3'&#8208;L). The compound is isostructural with its mono(amino) analogue Zn(BPZNH2) and with  Zn(3,5&#8208;L), its isomeric parent built with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyrazole.The textural analysis has unveiled its micro&#8208;/mesoporous nature, with&#160; BET area of 463 m2/g. Its CO2  adsorption capacity(17.4 wt.%CO2&#160;at p  CO2  = 1 bar and T = 298 K) and isosteric heat of adsorption (Q  st  = 24.8 kJ mol  &#8208;1) are comparable to that of  Zn(3,5&#8208;L). Both  Zn(3,3'&#8208;L)  and  Zn(3,5&#8208;L)  have been tested as heterogeneous catalysts in the reaction of CO2  with the epoxides epichlorohydrin and epibromohydrin to give the corresponding cyclic carbonates at T=393K and pCO2  =5 bar under solvent&#8208; and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. In general, the conversions recorded are higher than those found for Zn(BPZNH2),proving that the insertion of an extra amino tag in the pores is beneficial for the epoxidation catalysis. The best catalytic match has been observed for the  Zn(3,5&#8208;L)  /epichlorohydrin couple,with 64% conversion and a TOF of 5.3 mmol(carbonate)&#8729;(mmolZn)  &#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1.To gain better insights on the MOF&#8208;epoxide interaction, the crystal structure of the [epibromohydrin@Zn(3,3'&#8208;L)] adduct has been solved, confirming the existence of Br&#183;&#183;&#183;(H)&#8208;N non&#8208;bonding interactions.

      <title>Reactivity of Single Transition Metal Atoms on a Hydroxylated&#160;Amorphous Silica Surface: A Periodic Conceptual DFT Investigation.</title>
      <dc:description>The drive to develop maximal atom&#8208;efficient catalysts coupled to the continuous strive for more sustainable reactions has led to an ever&#8208;increasing interest in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

      <title>De Novo Design of Selective Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Junction Ligands and Structural Characterisation of their Binding Mode: Targeting the G4 Hot&#8208;Spot</title>
      <dc:description>Targeting the interface between DNA quadruplex and duplex regions by small molecules holds significant promise in both therapeutics and nanotechnology. Herein we report on a new pharmacophore that selectively binds with high affinity to quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions, while presenting a poorer affinity for G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA alone. Ligands complying with the reported pharmacophore exhibit a significant affinity and selectivity for quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions, including the one observed in the HIV&#8208;1 LTR&#8208;III sequence. The structure of the complex between a quadruplex&#8208;duplex junction with a ligand of this family has been determined by NMR methods. According to these data, the remarkable selectivity of this structural motif for quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions is achieved through an unprecedented interaction mode so far unexploited in medicinal and biological chemistry: the insertion of a benzylic ammonium moiety into the centre of the partially exposed interfacial G&#8208;tetrad. Further decoration of the described scaffolds with additional fragments opens up the road to the development of selective ligands for G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming regions of the genome.</dc:description>

Whereas the constraint into an 'in&#8208;plane'&#160;conformation of the two rings of the fluorophore is the main driver for the observed turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission in the presence of the antibiotics paromomycin, the electrostatics of the environment plays a minor role during the emission process.
