         <title>Single&#8208;phase precursors for the preparation of spinel ferrites via oxalate route: the study of cobalt ferrite synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the benefits of single&#8208;phase oxalate precursors for the preparation of spinel ferrites by thermal decomposition. A direct comparison between the genuine oxalate solid solution and the physical mixture of simple oxalates is presented using the case study of cobalt ferrite preparation. The mixing of metal cations within a single oxalate structure could be verified prior to its thermal decomposition by several non&#8208;destructive experimental techniques, namely M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In&#8208;situ XRD experiments were conducted to compare the decomposition processes of the solid solution and the physical mixture. Additionally, the decomposition products of the FeCo oxalate solid solution were studied ex&#8208;situ by means of N  2  adsorption, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and XRD. The results obtained for different reaction temperatures demonstrate the possibilities to easily control the physical properties of the prepared oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonalization of polyaryl linkers as a route to more porous phosphonate metal&#8208;organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer more robust structures than the majority of MOFs. However, the coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials have easier routes to well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we apply a ligand orthogonalization strategy to form more porous phosphonate MOFs. We report a multistep synthesis of an orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2). To illustrate the general structure directing role of the linker, we report a series of six crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF 35&#8208;39) by coordinating divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). When coordinated to metals, H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8211;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9 x 10.1 &#197;2 square channels. Stability testing of all structures was carried out and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn) retained its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH 3&#8208;11.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetranuclear Dicationic Aurophilic Gold(I) Catalysts in Enyne Cycloisomerization: Cooperativity for a Dramatic Shift in Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards specific &#8220;cluster&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity? Ligands pre&#8208;organizing gold centers in a constrained environment, assisted by aurophilic interactions, push further the selectivity not achieved by mono&#8208; and digold complexes from previously unseen cooperative tetragold catalysis.







Abstract
In comparison to mononuclear gold Lewis acid catalysts, digold complexes and dual&#8208;gold catalysis have illustrated a distinct and powerful potential for the activation of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds. Herein, this concept is pushed further by designing novel tetranuclear gold(I) dicationic complexes structurally supported by strongly stabilizing constraint diphosphinoferrocenyl ligands and attractive closed&#8208;shell Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au aurophilic interactions. The use of a molecularly&#8208;defined tetranuclear dicationic aurophilic gold(I) precatalyst for the selectivity&#8208;challenging cycloisomerization of low&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes favors the formation with high selectivity of strained azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;enes &#8211; even in the complete absence of activating/orienting substituents on alkyne and olefin reactive functions. This selectivity is not achieved by the reported phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;stabilized mono&#8208; and dinuclear cationic gold(I) complexes, including the ones formed from the same ligands. More importantly this selectivity differs also from nanoparticles and heterogeneous gold catalysts reported to date.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Towards specific &#8220;cluster-like&#8221; reactivity&lt;/b&gt;? Ligands pre-organizing gold centers in a constrained environment, assisted by aurophilic interactions, push further the selectivity not achieved by mono- and digold complexes from previously unseen cooperative tetragold catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison to mononuclear gold Lewis acid catalysts, digold complexes and dual-gold catalysis have illustrated a distinct and powerful potential for the activation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Herein, this concept is pushed further by designing novel tetranuclear gold(I) dicationic complexes structurally supported by strongly stabilizing constraint diphosphinoferrocenyl ligands and attractive closed-shell Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au aurophilic interactions. The use of a molecularly-defined tetranuclear dicationic aurophilic gold(I) precatalyst for the selectivity-challenging cycloisomerization of low-substituted 1,6-enynes favors the formation with high selectivity of strained azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept-4-enes &#8211; even in the complete absence of activating/orienting substituents on alkyne and olefin reactive functions. This selectivity is not achieved by the reported phosphine- and carbene-stabilized mono- and dinuclear cationic gold(I) complexes, including the ones formed from the same ligands. More importantly this selectivity differs also from nanoparticles and heterogeneous gold catalysts reported to date. DFT studies correlated to experimental mechanistic investigations support an unprecedented &#8220;cluster-like&#8221; reactivity from polynuclear cooperation at the origin of this peculiar selectivity where the aurophilic interactions preexist, and pre-organize, gold cluster reactive intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Different Topologies of Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine 1D Coordination Polymers: Dynamic Behavior in Solvent Adsorption and Exchange Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reacting the novel bispidine ligand L3 with HgCl2, various coordination polymers having three different topologies (zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly[n]catenane), but all constituted by linear 1D arrays, can be formed. Their ability to undergo structural transformation via adsorption or solvent exchange has been reported and related to their structural features.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination polymers (CPs) featuring three different topologies, comprising zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane structures, were obtained by reaction of Hg(II) ions with a novel bispidine ligand L3, and structurally characterized by SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD methods. The CPs obtained in the form of microcrystalline powders were tested for their ability to undergo solvent adsorption and exchange by P&#8208;XRD and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The extent of their dynamic behavior was then correlated to their structural features, highlighting the role of interchain interactions established among their constituting linear arrays. Zig&#8208;zag CPs proved to be resilient to external chemical stimuli, while they differently respond to thermal treatments, depending on the solvent originally included within the CP. In the case of polycatenated structures, we observed transformations where the original topology was maintained upon guest exchange, but also cases where it changed to zig&#8208;zag, even under solid/vapor conditions (i.&#8201;e., no complete dissolution of the CP). Given the presence of linear interconnected 1D channels, 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClBz&#8208;polycatenanePwd is also able to trap volatile guests such as n&#8208;hexane when exposed to its vapors.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Photoisomerization of N,N&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Indigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo photoswitches can undergo photoisomerization triggered by red&#8208;light, which is of immense potential in applications such as biomedical research and material science. In this mechanistic investigation, the influence of chemical environment and N&#8208;substituents is elucidated through photophysical and computational approaches. This study further provides insights into the course of photoisomerization.







Abstract
N,N&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted indigos are photoswitchable molecules that have recently caught the attention due to their addressability by red&#8208;light. When alkyl and aryl groups are utilized as the N&#8208;substituents, the thermal half&#8208;lives of Z isomers can be tuned independently while maintaining the advantageous red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. To utilize these molecules in real&#8208;world applications, it is of immense importance to understand how their molecular structures as well as the environment influence their switching properties. To this end, we probed their photoisomerization mechanism by carrying out photophysical and computational studies in solvents of different polarities. The fluorescence and transient absorption experiments suggest for more polar excited and transition states, which explains the bathochromic shifts of absorption spectra and shorter thermal half&#8208;lives. On the other hand, the quantum chemical calculations reveal that in contrast to N&#8208;carbonyl groups, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl substituents are not strongly conjugated with the indigo chromophore and can thus serve as a tool for tuning the thermal stability of Z isomers. Both approaches are combined to provide in&#8208;depth understandings of how indigos undergo photoswitching as well as how they are influenced by N&#8208;substituent and the chemical surroundings. These mechanistic insights will serve as guiding principles for designing molecules eyeing broader applications.

         <title>Type S Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases for the Rapid Generation of Tailormade Peptide Libraries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following a previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), the de novo generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide libraries with unprecedented simplicity was envisaged. By using synthetic zippers, NRPSs were split in up to three subunits to produce 49 peptides at titres up to 145&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Bacterial natural products in general, and non&#8208;ribosomally synthesized peptides in particular, are structurally diverse and provide us with a broad range of pharmaceutically relevant bioactivities. Yet, traditional natural product research suffers from rediscovering the same scaffolds and has been stigmatized as inefficient, time&#8208;, labour&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive. Combinatorial chemistry, on the other hand, can produce new molecules in greater numbers, cheaper and in less time than traditional natural product discovery, but also fails to meet current medical needs due to the limited biologically relevant chemical space that can be addressed. Consequently, methods for the high throughput generation of new natural products would offer a new approach to identifying novel bioactive chemical entities for the hit to lead phase of drug discovery programs. As a follow&#8208;up to our previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), we now envisaged the de novo generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) on an unreached scale. Using synthetic zippers, we split NRPSs in up to three subunits and rapidly generated different bi&#8208; and tripartite NRPS libraries to produce 49 peptides, peptide derivatives, and de novo peptides at good titres up to 145&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. A further advantage of type S NRPSs not only is the possibility to easily expand the created libraries by re&#8208;using previously created type S NRPS, but that functions of individual domains as well as domain&#8208;domain interactions can be studied and assigned rapidly.

         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel was found for the first time that it has both significantly enhanced oxidase&#8208;like (OXD&#8208;like) and peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activities at neutral pH. The strategy of dissociating H+ from Fmoc&#8208;FF at neutral pH break pH limit and has a universal effect on nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; or peroxidase&#8208;like over a wide pH range, this work accelerates the application of nanozymes in biological system.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities have potential in antibacterial therapy. The optimal activity of most nanozymes occurred in acidic pH&#8197;(3.0&#8211;5.0), while the pH in biological systems is mostly near neutral. Herein, a general system using 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) hydrogel for enhancing oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities of Pt NPs and other typical enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials at neutral or even alkaline pH is proposed. In this system, Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel provides an acidic microenvironment for Pt NPs due to hydrogen protons (H+) produced by the dissociation of F at neutral pH. As a result, Pt NPs exhibits 6&#8208;fold enhanced oxidase&#8208;like and 26&#8208;fold peroxidase&#8208;like activity after being encapsulated into Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel at pH&#8197;7.0. Based on outstanding enzymatic activities and the antibacterial activity of Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel itself, Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel realizes excellent antibacterial effect. This design provides a universal strategy to break pH limitation of nanozymes and promotes the biological applications of nanozymes.

Herein, a general system using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-modified diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) hydrogel for enhancing oxidase- and peroxidase-like activities of Pt NPs and other typical enzyme-like nanomaterials at neutral or even alkaline pH is proposed. In this system, Fmoc-FF hydrogel provides an acidic microenvironment for Pt NPs due to hydrogen protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) produced by the dissociation of F at neutral pH. As a result, Pt NPs exhibits 6-fold enhanced oxidase-like and 26-fold peroxidase-like activity after being encapsulated into Fmoc-FF hydrogel at pH&#8197;7.0. Based on outstanding enzymatic activities and the antibacterial activity of Fmoc-FF hydrogel itself, Pt-Fmoc-FF hydrogel realizes excellent antibacterial effect. This design provides a universal strategy to break pH limitation of nanozymes and promotes the biological applications of nanozymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Assisted Covalent Surface Functionalization of Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanosheets with Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightning @ surface: The visible&#8208;light irradiation of unharmful and photolabile arylazo sulfones enabled the efficient covalent decoration (i.&#8201;e. arylation) of reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide (rGO) surfaces under mild, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions. Nanomanipulation of the tagged rGO surface via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling was also documented.







Abstract
We present an environmentally benign methodology for the covalent functionalization (arylation) of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with arylazo sulfones. A variety of tagged aryl units were conveniently accommodated at the rGO surface via visible&#8208;light irradiation of suspensions of carbon nanostructured materials in aqueous media. Mild reaction conditions, absence of photosensitizers, functional group tolerance and high atomic fractions (XPS analysis) represent some of the salient features characterizing the present methodology. Control experiments for the mechanistic elucidation (Raman analysis) and chemical nanomanipulation of the tagged rGO surfaces are also reported.

         <title>Design of Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Catalyst for Preparation of Thiophosphinates from Phosphine Oxides and Thiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTA) under solvothermal conditions, which is named as Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF. The designed Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibits better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability and excellent recyclability for the preparation of thiophosphinates from phosphine oxides and thiols, which opens a new way to develop metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, and economical photocatalysts for organic transformations.







Abstract
Two new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF) or 2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF) under solvothermal conditions. These two COFs were further facilely developed as efficient photocatalytic platforms for the synthesis of thiophosphinates. Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibited better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability, and excellent recycling capacity for the preparation of thiophosphinates from P(O)H compounds and thiols compared to Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF. This methodology was further extended to the seamless gram&#8208;scale production of target phosphorothioate derivatives. The results demonstrate that COFs can provide a robust platform for developing metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, highly efficient, and reusable heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multifunctionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;bottomed synthesis: In situ&#8208;generated diarylcuprates enable the selective synthesis of multifunctionalized ketones from thioesters in excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction could be applied to preparing synthetic intermediates for canagliflozin and (+)&#8208;biotin. A reaction mechanism for this ketone synthesis was proposed based on control experiments with an isolated diphenylcuprate complex, [Mg2Br3(THF)6][CuPh2], and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Ketones were selectively synthesized from thioesters by using diarylcuprates(I) generated in&#8197;situ from copper(I) salts and aryl Grignard reagents in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1.3&#8211;1.5&#8197;ratio under ambient temperature. During the ketone synthesis, various functional groups, such as carbonyl (ketones, esters, and amides), O&#8208;protecting groups, halogens, and heteroarenes, were tolerated to afford multifunctionalized ketones in excellent yields. This copper&#8208;mediated ketone synthesis could be applied to the synthesis of not only gluconolactone&#8208;derived ketone 6, a synthetic intermediate in the transformation to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, but also thiolactol 8, a valuable synthetic intermediate for (+)&#8208;biotin. Control experiments on an isolated diphenylcuprate(I), [CuPh2]&#8722; (12), and DFT calculations revealed that this ketone synthesis proceeded by oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond of thioesters to [CuPh2]&#8722;, while reductive elimination from the CuIII intermediate produced the corresponding ketone and an inactive species [(RS)CuPh]&#8722;, the latter reacted with [CuPh]4 (11) to regenerate the reactive diphenylcuprate(I).

         <title>Single Crystals of Mixed&#8208;Cation Copper&#8208;Based Perovskite with Trimodal Bandgap Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easily exfoliated, two dimensional mixed&#8208;cation Cu&#8208;perovskite single crystals reveal three different diffraction patterns with trimodal bandgap behavior. Cation engineering has the potential to increase photovoltaic performance of Cu&#8208;perovskites.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites with novel functionalities and structural diversity are a perfect platform for emerging optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Here, we demonstrate that excess concentration of Cesium bromide (CsBr) is key to the formation of easily exfoliated 2D Cs2Cu(Cl/Br)4 perovskite crystal. Furthermore, by employing this trick to 2D perovskite MA2Cu(Cl/Br)4 (MA=methylammonium), we achieve a phase&#8208;pure easily exfoliated 2D mixed&#8208;cation (MA/Cs)2Cu(Cl/Br)4 perovskite crystal, which exhibits reduced bandgap (1.53&#8197;eV) with ferromagnetic behavior and photovoltaic property. The resultant mixed&#8208;cation structured device reveals enhanced efficiency compared to all MA and all Cs counterparts. These findings demonstrate the importance of cation&#8208;engineering in developing innovative materials with novel properties.

         <title>Impact of Heterocycle Annulation on NIR Absorbance in Quinoid Thioacene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homologous series of quinoid bisimidazolylidene&#8208;derived thioacenes has been synthesised and investigated for their optoelectronic and magnetic properties. All investigated small&#8208;band&#8208;gap quinoids show stability at room temperature in the presence of oxygen and display strong NIR absorption. Three&#8208; and fourfold annulated quinoids display partially open&#8208;shell singlet diradical character.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a homologous series of quinoid sulfur&#8208;containing imidazolyl&#8208;substituted heteroacenes is described. The optoelectronic and magnetic properties were investigated by UV/vis, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, and were compared to those of the corresponding benzo congener. The room&#8208;temperature and atmospherically stable quinoids display strong absorption in the NIR region between 678 and 819&#8197;nm. The dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene and the thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivatives were EPR active at room temperature. For the latter, variable&#8208;temperature EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a thermally accessible triplet state, with a singlet&#8208;triplet separation of 14.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>On the Existence and Role of Formaldehyde During Aqueous Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Monoxide to Methanol by Cobalt Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A fresh look: Molecular electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide with Co phthalocyanine leads to methanol, with formaldehyde being formed as an intermediate as well as a secondary product. Demonstration of this rare reactivity and mechanistic insights open a new perspective for the solar fuel community.







Abstract
A long&#8208;time challenge in aqueous CO2 electrochemical reduction is to catalyze the formation of products beyond carbon monoxide with selectivity. Formaldehyde is the simplest of these products and one of the most relevant due to its broad use in the industry. Paradoxically it is one of the less reported product. Such scarcity may be in part explained by difficult identification and quantification using conventional chromatography or proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Likewise, indirect detection methods are usually not compatible with labelled studies for asserting product origin. Recently, the possible production of formaldehyde during electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol at cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst in basic media has been the object of contradictory reports. By applying an analytical procedure based on proton NMR along with labelled studies, we provide definitive evidence for HCHO formation. We have further identified the possible scenarios for methanol formation through formaldehyde and revealed that the formation of the intermediate and its subsequent reduction are taking place at the same single active site. These studies open a new perspective to improve selectivity toward formaldehyde formation and to develop a subsequent chemistry based on reacting it with nucleophiles.

         <title>Iodine Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Dipyridyl Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mopping up radioactive iodine: A cationic MOF with the abundant metal aluminium shows chemisorption of iodine from a gas atmosphere at room temperature that is suitable for the capture of the radioisotopes 129I and 131I. The capture is explicitly stable as triiodide ions are formed with iodide inside the MOF pores. High uptake of up to one equivalent of I2 per aluminium centre marks the material out as highly suitable for applications in capturing radioactive isotopes, for example, from toxic nuclear waste as required after an unwanted hazardous exposure to the environment. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. M&#252;ller&#8208;Buschbaum et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104171).

Single crystals of [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) were obtained from a solvothermal reaction with SO3, and their electronic properties were investigated by means of density functional theory&#8211;based calculations. [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] exhibits a cluster&#8208;like cation, and the cationic gold&#8211;chloride strands in [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) are found to resemble one&#8208;dimensional metallic wires; this was further confirmed by polarization microscopy.

Polymers for solar cells: This review summarizes high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors based on the recently developed electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, including bithiophene imide (BTI) derivatives, B&#8592;N&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors. Additionally, the single&#8208;component&#8208;based polymers are also briefly discussed. Finally, we also offer our insights into the materials design for realizing all&#8208;PSCs with further improved device performance and stability.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their pronounced advantages of excellent mechanical flexibility/stretchability and greatly enhanced device stability as compared to other types of organic solar cells (OSCs). Thanks to the extensive research efforts dedicated to the development of polymer acceptors, all&#8208;PSCs have achieved remarkable improvement of photovoltaic performance, recently. This review summarizes the recent progress of polymer acceptors based on the key electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, which include bithiophene imide (BTI) derivatives, boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N)&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). In addition, single&#8208;component&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs are also briefly discussed. The structure&#8208;property correlations of polymer acceptors are elaborated in detail. Finally, we offer our insights into the development of new electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with further optimized properties and the polymers built from them for efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Swinging of a Nitrobenzyl Pendant Arm in a Nickel Scorpionand Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven intra&#8208;molecular motion on cathodic reduction of the NiII macrocyclic complex a, the electron first goes on the nitro group (b), then, following the swinging motion of the nitrobenzyl side chain, it is transferred onto the metal centre, giving rise to an authentic NiI (d9) scorpionate complex (c).







Abstract
A radical anion &#8722;NO2.&#8722; is formed upon an electrochemically reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of the square&#8208;planar NiII complex of N&#8208;nitrobenzylcyclam. The &#8722;NO2.&#8722; group goes to occupy an axial position of the metal ion, thus establishing a significant electronic interaction with the metal center. In particular, the ESR spectrum supports the occurrence of an electron transfer from &#8722;NO2.&#8722; to the metal, which therefore presents a significant NiI character. On re&#8208;oxidation, the nitrobenzyl side chain detaches and the NiII complex is restored, providing an example of a fully reversible redox driven intramolecular motion.

         <dc:description>The oxidation of [(Cp*Mo)2(&#181;,&#627;6:&#627;6&#8208;P6)] ( 1 ) with halogens or halogen sources was investigated.

         <dc:description>Pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions of M  I  Ag  II  F  3  perovskites (M = K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100 GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M = K and Rb consists of an orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic transition, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner&#8208;sharing [AgF  6  ]  4&#8211;  octahedra and their mutual approaching via secondary Ag&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal &#8594; triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF  3  , associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn Teller&#8208;distorted first coordination sphere of Ag(II) and association of the infinite [AgF  6  ]  4&#8211;  chains into a polymeric sublattice. The phase transitions markedly decrease the coupling strength of intra&#8208;chain antiferromagnetic superexchange in MAgF  3  hosts lattices.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;triggered removal of nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water by metal&#8208;organic polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of Rh(II)&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility via acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared  in situ  by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers' borane,  i. e.  HB(C  6  F  5  )  2  . The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A methodology for the controlled production of MOF morphologies through additive design is applied to synthesize new morphologies for a series of crystallographically cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This approach broadly provides a model for the design and synthesis of morphologies with desired crystal facets that can be accessed based on an understanding and use of connections between additives and metal cluster across a pore window.







Abstract
Exerting morphological control over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for determining their catalytic performance and to optimize their packing behavior in areas from separations to fuel gas storage. A mechanism&#8208;based approach to tailor the morphology of MOFs is introduced and experimentally demonstrated for five cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This methodology provides three key features: 1) computational screening for selection of appropriate additives to change crystal morphology based on knowledge of the crystal structure alone; 2) use of additive to metal cluster geometric relationships to achieve morphologies expressing desired crystallographic facets; 3) potential for suppression of interpenetration for certain phases.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reaction of Aldehydes to C&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>

Challenging transformation A peptide catalyst facilitated access to succinimides and downstream heterocycles with three contiguous stereogenic centers via stereo&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and regioselective conjugate addition reaction between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Disordered Low Molecular Weight Spiropyran Exhibiting Photoregulated Adhesion Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive adhesives are attractive functional materials. Differentiating from the reported azobenzene&#8208;containing adhesives with photoswitched adhesion&#8208;on or off property, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit photoregulated adhesion ability in multiple levels is disclosed in this work. In disordered solid state, the reported spiropyran could also gain photochromism with five different color states, which show one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the adhesion ability. This work provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.







Abstract
The functions of the materials composed of small molecules are highly dependent on their ordered molecular arrangements in both natural and artificial systems. Without ordered structure, small molecules hardly gain complicated functions, due to the absence of intermolecular covalent bond connection or strong network. Here, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit attractive photochromism and powerful adhesion property in disordered solid state is demonstrated. With maximum up to &#8764;8&#8197;MPa, the adhesion strength could be photoregulated in multiple levels, which also shows one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the specific color state. The working mechanism analysis on the photoregulated adhesion reveals that the isomer ratio of merocyanine form and the molecular packing density of spiropyran are the determining factors for the adhesion ability. The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Carbazole&#8208;Derived Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gone in a flash: Two novel photocages, NCARB, and its more water&#8208;soluble analog, NCARB&#8208;DA, have been developed. Both exhibit photophysical properties superior to other o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;derived photocages and may be used to cage carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups as exemplified by the use of NCARB&#8208;DA to cage a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a protected tyrosine residue.







Abstract
We report the design, synthesis and evaluation of two novel photocages, NCARB and isoNCARB, belonging to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl chemotype and based on the carbazole ring system. The synthesis of each of these isomeric caging molecules was achieved in five steps and in 29&#8201;% overall yield, and their photochemical properties were evaluated using benzoic acid as a model for caging. In the event, upon irradiation at 400&#8197;nm for 60&#8197;min, 82&#8201;% and 42&#8201;% of benzoic acid was freed from the NCARB and isoNCARB photocages, respectively, whereas only 22&#8201;% was released from the nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF) cage. Moreover, the photochemical decaging efficiencies, &#1013;&#934;, of the benzoates photocaged with NCARB and isoNCARB are about 150&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold better, respectively, at 400&#8197;nm than the corresponding caged benzoate derived from NDBF. The water solubility of molecules caged with nitrocarbazole analogs was improved by N&#8208;alkylation of NCARB, the better of the two new photocages, with an aminodicarboxylate group. This modified cage, NCARB&#8208;DA, was exploited in the design of a caged fluoroquinolone antibiotic, the efficacy of which was illustrated in a bacterial growth inhibition assay, and a phenol&#8208;caged tyrosine derivative.

         <title>Coordination and Hydroboration of Ru(II)&#8208;Borate Complexes: Dihydridoborate vs. Bis(dihydridoborate)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 18&#8208;electron pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate and bis(dihydridoborate) complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterised. Isolation of Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complexes permitted hydroboration reactions with [HC&#8801;C(CO2Me)] that unusually led to the formation of &#951;4&#8208;&#963;,&#960;&#8208;alkene&#8208;borane complexes via both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov additions.







Abstract
Treatment of [Cp*RuCl2]2, 1, [(COD)IrCl]2, 2 or [(p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2]2, 3 (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5, COD= 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and p&#8208;cymene=&#951;6&#8208;iPrC6H4Me) with heterocyclic borate ligands [Na[(H3B)L], L1 and L2 (L1: L=amt, L2: L=mp; amt=2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole, mp=2&#8208;mercaptopyridine) led to the formation of borate complexes having uncommon coordination. For example, complexes 1 and 2 on reaction with L1 and L2 afforded dihydridoborate species [LAM(&#956;&#8208;H)2BHL] 4&#8211;6 (4: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=amt; 5: LA=Cp*, M=Ru, L=mp; 6: LA=COD, M=Ir, L=mp). On the other hand, treatment of 3 with L2 yielded cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}2], cis&#8208;7 and trans&#8208;7. The isolation and structural characterization of fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[Ru{(&#956;&#8208;H)2BH(mp)}{(&#956;&#8208;H)BH(mp)2}], 8 from the same reaction offered an insight into the behaviour of these dihydridoborate species in solution. Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at cis&#8208;and trans&#8208;7, they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition products, 10&#8201;a&#8211;d.

Fascinatingly, despite having reduced natural charges on Ru centres both at &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, they underwent hydroboration reaction with alkynes that yielded both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition products, &lt;b&gt;10&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Veratryl Alcohol Derivatives Using RuCo/rGO Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>

Composites of RuCo alloy nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RuCo/rGO) with Ru to Co ratios of 1&#8201;:&#8201;0 to 1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1, can catalyzed effectively C&#945;&#8722;OH in lignin model compounds using O2 as oxidant at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h, owing to the combination of the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru, the unique flower&#8208;shaped morphology of RuCo alloy nanoparticles.







Abstract
Chemoselectively oxidizing C&#945;&#8722;OH to C=O has been considered as a key step for the oxidative depolymerization of lignin. In this work, we design and prepare a series of composites of RuCo alloy nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (RuCo/rGO) with different Ru to Co ratios and explore their catalytic activities in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol derivatives, which usually serve as the model compounds for studying lignin oxidation. It is illustrated that the Ru to Co ratio determines the morphology and average size of the RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO, and the overall catalytic activities of the composites. The RuCo alloy nanoparticles on rGO with Ru to Co ratios of 1&#8201;:&#8201;0 to 1.2&#8201;:&#8201;1 show a unique flower&#8208;shaped morphology that increases the exposure of the active sites and thus promotes their contact with the substrates. The RuCo/rGO composites exhibit high catalytic activities for the oxidation of C&#945;&#8722;OH to aldehydes at 100&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. Additionally, the Co component affords the RuCo/rGO composites with magnetic properties that make the separation and recovery of the catalyst simple. Given the high catalytic performances and easy recovery, the RuCo/rGO composites would be potentially useful for the depolymerization of lignin.

         <title>Sigma/pi Bonding Preferences of Solvated Alkali&#8208;Metal Cations to Ditopic Arylmethyl Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selection of diarylmethanes have been deprotonated at the bridgehead by alkali&#8208;metal bases and then trapped as monomers with polydentate N&#8208;donors to probe the different sigma/pi preferences of the resulting potentially ditopic anions towards the Li, Na or K cations. X&#8208;ray crystallography, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations have been employed to interrogate the nature of these interactions across all three phases.







Abstract
Arylmethyl anions allow alkali&#8208;metals to bind in a &#963;&#8208;fashion to the lateral carbanionic centre or a &#960;&#8208;fashion to the aryl ring or in between these extremities, with the trend towards &#960; bonding increasing on descending group 1. Here we review known alkali metal structures of diphenylmethane, fluorene, 2&#8208;benzylpyridine and 4&#8208;benzylpyridine. Next, we synthesise Li, Na, K monomers of these diarylmethyls using polydentate donors PMDETA or Me6TREN to remove competing oligomerizing interactions, studying the effect that two aromatic rings has on negative charge (de)localisation via NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT studies. Diphenylmethyl and fluorenyl anions maintain C(H)&#8722;M interactions regardless of alkali&#8208;metal, although the adjacent arene carbons engage in interactions with larger alkali&#8208;metals. Introducing a nitrogen atom into the ring (at the 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;position) encourages relocalisation of negative charge away from the deprotonated carbon and onto nitrogen. Phenyl(2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl moves from an enamide formation at one extremity (lithium) to an aza&#8208;allyl formation at the other extremity (potassium), while C&#8208; or N&#8208;coordination modes become energetically viable for Na and K phenyl(4&#8208;pyridyl)methyl complexes.

Rapid, ultrasensitive, extraction&#8208;free and amplification&#8208;free strategy for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) RNA using a microfluidic biochip that exhibits an ultralow detection limit (600&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1) and the ability to simultaneously evaluate 15&#8197;RNA samples within 40&#8197;min. The proposed RNA detection strategy has prospective applications in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection and COVID&#8208;19 (Corona virus disease 2019) patient diagnosis.







Abstract
The ongoing outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has spread globally and poses a threat to public health and National economic development. Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without the need of RNA extraction and amplification remain a key challenge. In this study, a new SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy using a microfluidic biochip for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 without RNA extraction and amplification was developed. This new strategy takes advantage of the specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA and probe DNA reaction in the microfluidic channel, fluorescence signal regulation by nanomaterials, and accurate sample control by the microfluidic chip. It presents an ultralow limit of detection of 600 copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1 in a large linear detection regime from 1 aM to 100&#8197;fM. Fifteen samples were simultaneously detected in 40&#8197;min without the need for RNA purification and amplification. The detection accuracy of the strategy was validated through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#8208;PCR), with a recovery of 99&#8211;113&#8201;%. Therefore, the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy proposed in this study can potentially be used for the quantitative diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.

The photophysical properties of a charge&#8208;photoaccumulating ruthenium complex are deciphered by mean of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory. This study sheds light on the decisive role played by the pyridoquinolinone subunit of the &#960;&#8208;extended dppz ligand in the photoinduced processes.







Abstract
The design of photoactive systems capable of storing and relaying multiple electrons is highly demanded in the field of artificial photosynthesis, where transformations of interest rely on multielectronic redox processes. The photophysical properties of the ruthenium photosensitizer [(bpy)2Ru(oxim&#8208;dppqp)]2+ (Ru), storing two electrons coupled to two protons on the &#960;&#8208;extended oxim&#8208;dppqp ligand under light&#8208;driven conditions, are investigated by means of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent resonance Raman and transient absorption spectroscopies, in combination with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory; the results are discussed in comparison to the parent [(bpy)2Ru(dppz)]2+ and [(bpy)2Ru(oxo&#8208;dppqp)]2+ complexes. In addition, this study provides in&#8208;depth insights on the impact of protonation or of accumulation of multiple reducing equivalents on the reactive excited states.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of spin state and spin coupling in gas binding selectivity in MOFs has been uncovered using periodic DFT calculations. The electron&#8208;transfer mechanism adopted by gaseous O2 leads to its strongly spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent binding, unlike the case for N2 and H2. O2/N2&#8208;selective adsorption/desorption processes have high commercial value, and this work offers a new strategy for such selective control.







Abstract
The coordinatively unsaturated chromium(II)&#8208;based Cr3[(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)8]2 (Cr&#8722;BTT; BTT3&#8722;=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O2 over N2/H2. Using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we attempted to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas&#8208;bound MOFs [(Cr4(X)4Cl)3(BTT)8]3&#8722; (X=O2, N2, and H2), we unequivocally established the role of spin states and spin coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The binding of O2 to the MOF follows an electron&#8208;transfer mechanism resulting in a CrIII superoxo species (O2.&#8722;) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, whereas N2/H2 are found to weakly interact with the metal center and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas&#8208;bound and unbound MOFs have an S=0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin the configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin state, with a significant energy margin (47.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of using spin state/spin couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.

         <title>Vinylcyclopropane [3+2] Cycloaddition with Acetylenic Sulfones Based on Visible Light Photocatalysis**

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new visible light&#8208;mediated intermolecular [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of meta photocycloadducts with acetylenic sulfones catalyzed by iridium complexes has been developed. The strain energy contained in the photogenerated vinylcyclopropane system enables efficient access to a new complex molecular scaffold under very mild conditions. DFT&#8208;calculations and time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy studies substantiated a triplet energy transfer mechanism.







Abstract
The first intermolecular visible light [3+2] cycloaddition reaction performed on a meta photocycloadduct employing acetylenic sulfones is described. The developed methodology exploits the advantages of combining UV and visible&#8208;light in a two&#8208;step sequence that provides a photogenerated cyclopropane which, through a strain&#8208;release process, generates a new cyclopentane ring while significantly increasing the molecular complexity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate an energy transfer pathway for the visible light&#8208;driven reaction step. This strategy could be extended to simpler vinylcyclopropanes.

         <title>Planar Chiral Rhodium Complexes of 1,4&#8208;Benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral rhodium complexes are widely used in asymmetric catalysis. Herein we describe a new approach to such chiral complexes featuring the intrinsically achiral benzoquinone ligands. The synthesis was achieved by the face&#8208;selective coordination of 2,5&#8208;substituted benzoquinones with rhodium bearing the readily available oxazoline&#8208;phenolate ligand. This chiral auxiliary ligand was subsequently replaced with retention of the planar chirality of (diene)Rh fragment. The selectivity of metal coordination was quantitatively predicted by DFT calculations before the actual synthesis.







Abstract
Diene rhodium complexes are important catalysts in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a new approach to such complexes with the uncommon planar chirality. The synthesis is achieved by face&#8208;selective coordination of the prochiral 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinones (R2&#8208;Q) with rhodium precursors containing the chiral auxiliary ligand S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline (S&#8208;Salox). Such coordination leads to the formation of (R,R&#8208;R2&#8208;Q)Rh(S&#8208;Salox) complexes in high yields and with exceptional diastereoselectivity (d.&#8201;r.&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Subsequent replacement of the auxiliary ligand provides various benzoquinone rhodium complexes with retention of the planar chirality. Combined theoretical and experimental studies show that due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature benzoquinones bind metals stronger than the related 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene, but weaker than other common diene ligands, such as cyclooctadiene.

         <title>Front Cover: The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (Chem. Eur. J. 18/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using periodic DFT calculations, we have illustrated how selective binding of O2 over N2 and H2 occurs in Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). In particular, the role of spin state and spin coupling in selective gas binding is highlighted. As selective O2 binding is required for oxygen concentrators, the proposed idea has high commercial value. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Pal, G. Rajaraman et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104526).

         <title>Cover Feature: Planar Chiral Rhodium Complexes of 1,4&#8208;Benzoquinones (Chem. Eur. J. 18/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral rhodium complexes are widely used in asymmetric catalysis. They usually contain intrinsically chiral ligands that provide the desired stereoselectivity. The quinone ligand, just like the playing card in the picture, is planar and thus not chiral. However, upon coordination with rhodium, the symmetry plane is removed, and a chiral complex appears. By using the appropriate auxiliary ligand, or by taking the card with the &#8220;right&#8221; hand, one can create chiral quinone complexes with exceptional stereoselectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;M. Ankudinov, Yu.&#8197;V. Nelyubina and D.&#8197;S. Perekalin (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200195).

         <title>Frontispiece: Properties of the Reactants and Their Interactions within and with the Enzyme Binding Cavity Determine Reaction Selectivities. The Case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 18, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding cavities of ODDs fine&#8208;tune the selectivities of catalysed reactions by precise positioning of the substrate with respect to the iron cofactor and by specific cavity&#8208;substrate interactions. The latter may outweigh the steric effects and the inherent reaction propensity of the reactants and thus settle product selectivity. For more information, see the Review by Z. Wojdyla and T. Borowski (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104106).

This review summarizes recent progress in nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents, which are useful methods for the preparation of diverse carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. In many cases, nickel catalysis enables unique modes of reactivity not readily available to other metal catalysts. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described. More information can be found in the review article by S.&#8197;M. Gillbard and H.&#8197;W. Lam et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104230)

         <title>Properties of the Reactants and Their Interactions within and with the Enzyme Binding Cavity Determine Reaction Selectivities. The Case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Dependent Enzymes</title>

Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases catalyse with high specificity a variety of oxidative transformations of their substrates. This review provides a survey of computational and experimental studies revealing structural and electronic factors responsible for a broad scope of chemistry performed by this class of enzymes. These factors encompass inherent properties of ferryl species and organic substrates, steric hindrance imposed by the enzyme, specific enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions and substrate's conformational freedom within the binding cavity.







Abstract
Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, that is hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, that is, substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme's binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Switches and Motors: Recent Developments and Applications</title>

This Review discusses the recent developments in the synthesis and applications of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology, etc. The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.

         <dc:description>
The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8208;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Recent studies have demonstrated nickel catalysis is highly effective in these reactions, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available using other metal catalysts. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents.







Abstract
The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8211;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Although rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts have been commonly used for these reactions, more recent work has demonstrated nickel catalysis is also highly effective, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Using periodic DFT calculations, we have studied in detail a Cr MOF for selective O2 binding and show that the spin state and spin coupling between the metals are crucial for gas separation.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202104526).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Sourav Pal, Gopalan Rajaraman and co&#8208;workers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research. The image depicts how a mixture of atmospheric gases such as CO2, H2, N2 and O2 can be selectively separated using a Cr metal&#8208;organic framework where spin state and spin coupling play a crucial role.

         <title>Effects of Cis/Trans&#8208;configuration and Ligand Substitution of the Cyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate the effects of cis/trans&#8208;configuration of the cyanidometal bridge and the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence compounds, two groups of trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(4,4'&#8208;dmbpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]2), 3 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]3  ), 4 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]4)) and cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]3  (cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3)&#160;were synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results indicate that for these one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidation mixed valence compounds, the trans&#8208;configuration compounds are more beneficial for MMCT than the cis&#8208;configuration compounds, and increasing the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge is also conductive to MMCT. Moreover, compounds  cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]n  (n = 3, 4) and  cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3  belong to localized compounds by analyzing the experimental characterization results, supported by the TDDFT calculations.</dc:description>

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl halides with chlorodifluoroacetamides and chlorodifluoroacetate has been developed. The synthetic simplicity from widely available fluorine sources and heteroaryl halides renders the protocol cost efficient synthesis of biologically active molecules, providing a facile route for applications in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl halides with chlorodifluoroacetamides and chlorodifluoroacetate has been developed. The combination of NiCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DME with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diNon&#8208;bpy, co&#8208;ligand PPh3, and additive LiCl renders the catalytic system efficient for the synthesis of medicinal interest heteroaryldifluoroacetamides. The application of the method leads to short and highly efficient synthesis of biologically active molecules, providing a facile route for applications in medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Strongly Interacting Diphenothiazene&#8208;TCBD and Diphenothiazene&#8208;DCNQ Push&#8208;Pull Triads</title>

Charge Transfer. A series of push&#8208;pull systems comprised of phenothiazine dimers and strong electron acceptors, TCBD or DCNQ, have been newly synthesized and characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods. The significance of phenothiazine dimer in the push&#8208;pull systems in promoting wide&#8208;band optical capture into the near&#8208;IR region, and facilitating ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer as a function of donor&#8208;acceptor distance and solvent polarity is presented.







Abstract
Three types of phenothiazines dimers (PTZ&#8208;PTZ, 1&#8211;3), covalently linked with one or two acetylene linkers, were synthesized by copper&#8208;mediated Eglinton and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions in excellent yields. The dimers 1&#8211;3 were further engaged in [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reactions with strong electron acceptors, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) to yield tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD, 1&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a), and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ, 1&#8201;b&#8211;3&#8201;b) functionalized donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugates, respectively. The conjugates were examined by a series of spectral, computational, and electrochemical studies. Strong ground state polarization leading to new optical transitions was witnessed in both series of D&#8208;A conjugates. In the case of DCNQ derived D&#8208;A system 1&#8201;b, the optical coverage extended until 1200&#8197;nm in benzonitrile, making this a rare class of D&#8208;A ICT system. Multiple redox processes were witnessed in these D&#8208;A systems, and the frontier orbitals generated on DFT optimized structures further supported the ICT phenomenon. Photochemical studies performed using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies confirmed solvent polarity dependent excited state charge transfer and separation in these novel multi&#8208;modular D&#8208;A conjugates. The charge&#8208;separated states lasted up to 70&#8197;ps in benzonitrile while in toluene slightly prolonged lifetime of up to 100&#8197;ps was witnessed. The significance of phenothiazine dimer in wide&#8208;band optical capture all the way into the near&#8208;IR region and promoting ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer in the D&#8208;A&#8208;D configured multi&#8208;modular systems, and the effect of donor&#8208;acceptor distance and the solvent polarity was the direct outcome of the present study.

         <title>Formation and Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Porphyrin&#8208; and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Doped Graphene Hybrids Synthesized by Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped graphene (NG) has been covalently decorated with porphyrin and phthalocyanine moieties using click chemistry. Evidence of charge separation in these hybrids has been secured from femtosecond transient absorption studies, acting NG as electron acceptor.







Abstract
Graphene doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen, boron, and phosphorous by replacing some of the skeletal carbon atoms is emerging as an important class of two&#8208;dimensional materials as it offers the much&#8208;needed bandgap for optoelectronic applications and provides better access for chemical functionalization at the heteroatom sites. Covalent grafting of photosensitizers onto such doped graphenes makes them extremely useful for light&#8208;induced applications. Herein, we report the covalent functionalization of N&#8208;doped graphene (NG) with two well&#8208;known electron donor photosensitizers, namely, zinc porphyrin (ZnP) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), using the simple click chemistry approach. Covalent attachment of ZnP and ZnPc at the N&#8208;sites of NG in NG&#8722;ZnP and NG&#8722;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed by using a range of spectroscopic, thermogravimetric and imaging techniques. Ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state interactions in NG&#8722;ZnP and NG&#8722;ZnPc were monitored by using spectral and electrochemical techniques. Efficient quenching of photosensitizer fluorescence in these hybrids was observed, and the relatively easier oxidations of ZnP and ZnPc supported excited&#8208;state charge&#8208;separation events. Photoinduced charge separation in NG&#8722;ZnP and NG&#8722;ZnPc hybrids was confirmed by using the ultrafast pump&#8208;probe technique. The measured rate constants were of the order of 1010&#8197;s,&#8722;1 thus indicating ultrafast electron transfer phenomena.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Quantum Tunneling and Hydrogen Bonding Rearrangements Characterize the Solid&#8208;Solid Phase Transitions in a Phosphonium&#8208;Based Protic Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunneling driven dynamics of the d3&#8208;octyl phosphonium cation in an ionic liquid is observed by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Deuteron line&#8208;shape analysis and relaxation time measurements provide information about the structure, mobility and rearrangements of the cations for the broad temperature range between 73 and 343&#8197;K. Differently strong hydrogen bonds are reported for the solid, supercooled and liquid state of the IL and map the change in molecular ordering upon phase transformation.







Abstract
We report the complex phase behavior of the glass forming protic ionic liquid (PIL) d3&#8208;octylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C8H17PD3][NTf2] by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Combined line shape and spin relaxation studies of the deuterons in the PD3 group of the octylphosphonium cation allow to map and correlate the phase behavior for a broad temperature range from 71&#8197;K to 343&#8197;K. In the solid PIL at 71&#8197;K, we observed a static state, characterized by the first deuteron quadrupole coupling constant reported for PD3 deuterons. A transition enthalpy of about 12&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 from the static to the mobile state with increasing temperature suggests the breaking of a weak, charge&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond between cation and anion. The highly mobile phase above 100&#8197;K exhibits an almost disappearing activation barrier, strongly indicating quantum tunneling. Thus, we provide first evidence of tunneling driven mobility of the hydrogen bonded P&#8722;D moieties in the glassy state of PILs, already at surprisingly high temperatures up to 200&#8197;K. Above 250&#8197;K, the mobile phase turns from anisotropic to isotropic motion, and indicates strong internal rotation of the PD3 group. The analyzed line shapes and spin relaxation times allow us to link the structural and dynamical behavior at molecular level with the phase behavior beyond the DSC traces.

A series of chromium&#8208;halide, &#8208;nitride, and &#8208;dinitrogen complexes bearing carbene&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;based PCP&#8208;type pincer ligands has been newly prepared, and some of them are found to work as effective catalysts to reduce dinitrogen under atmospheric pressure, whereby up to 11.60&#8197;equiv. of ammonia and 2.52&#8197;equiv. of hydrazine (16.6&#8197;equiv. of fixed N atom) are produced based on the chromium atom. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful example of chromium&#8208;catalyzed conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia and hydrazine under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Elaborated Reaction Pathway of Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Conversion with H2O on Gallium Oxide&#8208;Decorated and &#8208;Defective Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Keeping active: During photothermal CO2 reduction with H2O, a Ga2O3 cocatalyst on anatase TiO2 (101) surface enhances the selective adsorption of CO2, and also balances the VO formation and CO2 reduction reactivity. Surface defect VO promotes reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed, and Ga2O3 helps to keep VO active.







Abstract
Ga2O3&#8208;decorated and &#8208;defective surface models based on anatase TiO2 have been established. The thermodynamic reaction pathways, including protonation, deoxygenation and hydroxylation steps, during CO2 conversion with H2O to C1 products were calculated. The calculation results demonstrate that a Ga2O3 cocatalyst enhances the selective adsorption of CO2 and slightly weakens the competitive adsorption of H2O. The promotion effect of Ga2O3 on the subsequent reaction depends on the availability of protons and electrons. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed that the basic functional site generated by Ga2O3 not only suppresses the back reaction of the OH group after H2O directly provides protons but also maintains the surface defect oxygen vacancy (VO), which promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed in the process. Additionally, Ga2O3 decoration promotes VO formation, and the coexistence of Ga2O3 and VO further decreases the reaction rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier, promoting C1 production.

         <title>Hidden Heptacyclic Chiral N&#8208;Acyl Iminium Ions: A New Entry to Enantioenriched Polycyclic Azepanes and Azocanes by Superacid&#8208;Promoted Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of enantioselective organocatalysis and superacid activation allows for the construction of enantioenriched complex fused&#8208;tricyclic azepanes or bridged&#8208;polycyclic azocanes from simple acyclic substrates. The hidden heptacyclic chiral N&#8208;acyl iminium ion is generated by superacid activation and is the key intermediate that triggers a chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular mono&#8208; or di&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Enantioenriched complex fused&#8208;tricyclic azepanes or bridged&#8208;polycyclic azocanes were constructed via a two&#8208;step sequence involving an enantioselective organocascade followed by superacid activation of the domino adduct. The activated oxa&#8208;bridged azepane acts as a key hidden heptacyclic chiral N&#8208;acyl iminium ion triggering a chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular mono&#8208; or di&#8208;arylation.

         <title>Luminescent Thin Films Enabled by CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) Precursor Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new soluble CsPbX3 precursor to in&#8208;situ prepare luminescent CsPbX3 nanocrystal film in the air readily was designed. The composition of the CsPbX3 NCs films can be tuned by changing the solution precursors, allowing obtaining a high color purity and a narrow emission width.







Abstract
Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are candidates for lighting and display materials due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, the dissolution issue of perovskite nanocrystals in polar solvents remains a challenge for practical applications. Herein, we present a newly designed one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating strategy to prepare a novel multicolor&#8208;tunable CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocrystal film, where the CsPbX3 precursor solution was formed by dissolving PbO, Cs2CO3, and CH3NH3X into the ionic liquid n&#8208;butylammonium butyrate. The as&#8208;designed CsPbX3 nanocrystal films show high color purity with a narrow emission width. Also, the blue CsPb(Cl/Br)3 film demonstrates an absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 15.6&#8201;%, which is higher than 11.7&#8201;% of green CsPbBr3 and 8.3&#8201;% of red CsPb(Br/I)3 film. This study develops an effective approach to preparing CsPbX3 nanocrystal thin films, opening a new avenue to design perovskite nanocrystals&#8208;based devices for lighting and display applications.

         <title>Characterization of Asx Turn Types and Their Connate Relationship with &#946;&#8208;Turns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One good turn promotes another: The Asx turn, a H&#8208;bonded, local secondary structure of the asparagine residue was investigated in the gas phase using laser spectroscopy and quantum chemistry studies of relevant model peptides. Comparison of these models with crystallized proteins supports the premise that Asx turns foster or stabilize the classical &#946;&#8208;turn structures, and even promote &#946;&#8208;bulges when Asn is followed by a Gly residue.







Abstract
Models of asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptides specifically designed to favor intrinsic folding into an Asx turn were characterized both theoretically, by using quantum chemistry, and experimentally, by using laser spectroscopy in the gas phase. Both approaches provided evidence for the spontaneous folding of both the Asn&#8208;Ala and Asn&#8208;Gly dipeptide models into the most stable Asx turn, a conformation stabilized by a C10 H&#8208;bond that was very similar to a type II&#8217; &#946;&#8208;turn. In parallel, analysis of Asx turns implicating asparagine in crystallized protein structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed a sequence&#8208;dependent behavior. In Asn&#8208;Ala sequences, the Asx turn was found in conjunction with a type I &#946;&#8208;turn for which the first of the four defining residues was Asn. The observation that the Asx turn in these structures is mostly of type II&#8217; (i.&#8201;e., its most stable innate structure) suggests that this motif might foster the formation and/or enhance the stability of the backbone &#946;&#8208;turn. In contrast, the Asx turns observed in Asn&#8208;Gly sequences extensively adopted a type II Asx&#8208;turn structure, thus suggesting that their formation should be ascribed to other factors, such as hydration. The fact that the Asx turn in a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence is also often found in combination with a hydrated &#946;&#8208;bulge supports the premise that a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence might efficiently promote the formation of the &#946;&#8208;bulge secondary structure.

     alt="Characterization of Asx Turn Types and Their Connate Relationship with &#946;-Turns"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One good turn promotes another&lt;/b&gt;: The Asx turn, a H-bonded, local secondary structure of the asparagine residue was investigated in the gas phase using laser spectroscopy and quantum chemistry studies of relevant model peptides. Comparison of these models with crystallized proteins supports the premise that Asx turns foster or stabilize the classical &#946;-turn structures, and even promote &#946;-bulges when Asn is followed by a Gly residue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models of asparagine-containing dipeptides specifically designed to favor intrinsic folding into an Asx turn were characterized both theoretically, by using quantum chemistry, and experimentally, by using laser spectroscopy in the gas phase. Both approaches provided evidence for the spontaneous folding of both the Asn-Ala and Asn-Gly dipeptide models into the most stable Asx turn, a conformation stabilized by a C10 H-bond that was very similar to a type II&#8217; &#946;-turn. In parallel, analysis of Asx turns implicating asparagine in crystallized protein structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed a sequence-dependent behavior. In Asn-Ala sequences, the Asx turn was found in conjunction with a type I &#946;-turn for which the first of the four defining residues was Asn. The observation that the Asx turn in these structures is mostly of type II&#8217; (i.&#8201;e., its most stable innate structure) suggests that this motif might foster the formation and/or enhance the stability of the backbone &#946;-turn. In contrast, the Asx turns observed in Asn-Gly sequences extensively adopted a type II Asx-turn structure, thus suggesting that their formation should be ascribed to other factors, such as hydration. The fact that the Asx turn in a Asn-Gly sequence is also often found in combination with a hydrated &#946;-bulge supports the premise that a Asn-Gly sequence might efficiently promote the formation of the &#946;-bulge secondary structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalysts Derived from Copper Complexes Transform CO into C2+ Products Effectively in a Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper phthalocyanine complex that mediates fast and selective electrolytic conversion of CO into multi&#8208;carbon products in a flow cell is reported in this work. The molecular species do not remain intact during electrolysis, but gets converted into an effective electrocatalyst layer during electrolysis. These findings present the opportunity to use the rich library of metal&#8208;complexes catalysts available in the literature, as well as new derivatives, for effective CO electrolysis at industrially&#8208;relevant rates of product formation.







Abstract
Electrochemical reactors that electrolytically convert CO2 into higher&#8208;value chemicals and fuels often pass a concentrated hydroxide electrolyte across the cathode. This strongly alkaline medium converts the majority of CO2 into unreactive HCO3&#8722; and CO32&#8722; byproducts rather than into CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) products. The electrolysis of CO (instead of CO2) does not suffer from this undesirable reaction chemistry because CO does not react with OH&#8722;. Moreover, CO can be more readily reduced into products containing two or more carbon atoms (i.&#8201;e., C2+ products) compared to CO2. We demonstrate here that an electrocatalyst layer derived from copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) mediates this conversion effectively in a flow cell. This catalyst achieved a 25&#8201;% higher selectivity for acetate formation at 200&#8197;mA/cm2 than a known state&#8208;of&#8208;art oxide&#8208;derived Cu catalyst tested in the same flow cell. A gas diffusion electrode coated with CuPc electrolyzed CO into C2+ products at high rates of product formation (i.&#8201;e., current densities &#8805;200&#8197;mA/cm2), and at high faradaic efficiencies for C2+ production (FEC2+; &gt;70&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA/cm2). While operando Raman spectroscopy did not reveal evidence of structural changes to the copper molecular complex, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that the catalyst undergoes conversion to a metallic copper species during catalysis. Notwithstanding, the ligand environment about the metal still impacts catalysis, which we demonstrated through the study of a homologous CuPc bearing ethoxy substituents. These findings reveal new strategies for using metal complexes for the formation of carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals and fuels at industrially relevant conditions.

For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self&#8208;assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed.

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded ethylenes composed of 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted carbon&#8208;carbon double (C=C) bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. As such, they are unique frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs). Various colored crystals of these FAEs, obtained using different solvents, correspond to multiple metastable conformations of the FAEs with various twist and fold angles of the C=C bond, as well as various dihedral angles of attached aryl units with respect to the C=C bond. The relationships between color and these parameters associated with conformational features around the C=C bond were elucidated using experimental and theoretical studies. Owing to the fact that they are separated by small energy barriers, the variously colored conformations in the FAE crystal change in response to various external stimuli, such as mechanical grinding, hydrostatic pressure and thermal heating.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral C&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of axially chiral compounds featuring a N&#8722;C stereogenic axis are presented and discussed, with an emphasis in catalytic asymmetric approaches. Diverse strategies and methodologies, based either on metal&#8208;catalyzed transformation or in organocatalytic activation, comprise not only the direct generation of the N&#8722;C axis but also desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic resolution and different types of chirality transfer.







Abstract
Molecules with restricted rotation around a single bond or atropisomers are found in a wide number of natural products and bioactive molecules as well as in chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis and smart materials. Although most of these compounds are biaryls and heterobiaryls displaying a C&#8722;C stereogenic axis, there is a growing interest in less common and more challenging axially chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers. This review offers an overview of the various methodologies available for their asymmetric synthesis. A brief introduction is initially given to contextualize these axially chiral skeletons, including a historical background and examples of natural products containing axially chiral C&#8722;N axes. The preparation of different families of C&#8722;N based atropisomers is then presented from anilides to chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring heterocycles. Special emphasis has been given to modern catalytic asymmetric strategies over the past decade for the synthesis of these chiral scaffolds. Applications of these methods to the preparation of natural products and biologically active molecules will be highlighted along the text.

         <title>Dissipative Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DDCvC) Based on the Transimination Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissipative dynamic libraries (DDLs) of imines are generated by addition of 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;chloro)phenylpropanoic acid employed as a chemical fuel to equilibrated dynamic libraries (DLs). At the addition of the fuel the initial composition of the library dictated by the thermodynamic equilibrium is perturbed and a transient, temporal controllable, out of equilibrium state is obtained, which reverts to the initial equilibrium when the fuel is exhausted.







Abstract
This work reports that the composition of a dynamic library (DL) of interconverting imines can be controlled over time in a dissipative fashion by the addition of an activated carboxylic acid used as a chemical fuel. When the fuel is added to the DL, which is initially under thermodynamic equilibrium, the composition of the mixture dramatically changes and a new, dissipative (out of equilibrium) state is reached that persists until fuel exhaustion. Thus, a transient dissipative dynamic library (DDL) is generated that, eventually, reverts back to the initial DL when the fuel is consumed, closing a DL&#8594;DDL&#8594;DL cycle. The larger the amount of added fuel, the longer the time spent by the system in the DDL state. The transimination reaction is shown to be an optimal candidate for the realization of a dissipative dynamic covalent chemistry (DDCvC).

         <title>Epigenetic Anti&#8208;Cancer Treatment With a Stabilized Carbocyclic Decitabine Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocyclic decitabine analogue cAzadC outperforms decitabine (5&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine, AzadC) in an acute myeloid leukemia cell line. AzadC is used in the clinic as an epigenetic drug against AML, but is very sensitive towards hydrolysis, which limits its application. cAzadC is substantially more stable than AzadC, but still inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and importantly, it induces significantly more deleterious DNA strand breaks than AzadC, making it a promising next&#8208;generation epigenetic drug.







Abstract
5&#8208;Aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (Decitabine, AzadC) is a nucleoside analogue, which is in clinical use to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Its mode of action is unusual because the compound is one of the few drugs that act at the epigenetic level of the genetic code. AzadC is incorporated as an antimetabolite into the genome and creates covalent, inhibitory links to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that methylate 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC). Consequently, AzadC treatment leads to a global loss of mdC, which presumably results in a reactivation of silenced genes, among them tumor suppressor and DNA damage response genes. Because AzadC suffers from severe instability, which limits its use in the clinic, a more sophisticated AzadC derivative would be highly valuable. Here, we report that a recently developed carbocyclic AzadC analogue (cAzadC) blocks DNMT1 in the AML cell line MOLM&#8208;13 as efficient as AzadC. Moreover, cAzadC has a surprisingly strong anti&#8208;proliferative effect and leads to a significantly higher number of double strand breaks compared to AzadC, while showing less off&#8208;target toxicity. These results show that cAzadC triggers more deleterious repair and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells than AzadC, which makes cAzadC a promising next generation epigenetic drug.

         <title>Module Assembly Strategy for Single&#8208;Cell Nucleic Acid Imaging at the Sub&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;cell imaging methods have unique advantages of maintaining the in&#8197;situ physiological state, morphology, and microenvironment. Herein, the design and application of single&#8208;cell imaging methods of nucleic acids at the sub&#8208;molecule level are summarized.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell imaging has unique advantages of maintaining the in&#8197;situ physiological state, morphology, and microenvironment, becoming a powerful tool to unravel the nature of intracellular nucleic acids. The analysis of nucleic acids unprecedentedly demands the sub&#8208;molecule details at segment or subunit, secondary structure and monomer levels, instead of just probing the sequence and the abundance of nucleic acids. Detection of nucleic acids at the sub&#8208;molecule level requires higher specificity and higher sensitivity, which becomes a new challenge in nucleic acid analysis. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in the design and the application of single&#8208;cell nucleic acid imaging methods at the sub&#8208;molecule level, including the visualization of RNA splicing variants, RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in an individual gene, single nucleotide variation of mitochondrial DNA, and RNA m6A methylation. Remarkably, we highlight the key strategy, &#8220;Module Assembly&#8221;, for high&#8208;performance molecular recognition and demonstrate the required improvements in future research.

Detection of nucleic acids at the sub-molecule level requires higher specificity and higher sensitivity, which becomes a new challenge in nucleic acid analysis. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in the design and the application of single-cell nucleic acid imaging methods at the sub-molecule level, including the visualization of RNA splicing variants, RNA G-quadruplexes in an individual gene, single nucleotide variation of mitochondrial DNA, and RNA m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation. Remarkably, we highlight the key strategy, &#8220;Module Assembly&#8221;, for high-performance molecular recognition and demonstrate the required improvements in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Thienyl DPP derivatives Functionalized with Terminal Electron&#8208;Acceptor Groups: Synthesis, Optical Properties and OFET Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel DPP derivatives characterized by terminal auxiliary acceptor groups have been reported. Because of their alternate donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure, the dyes are characterized by a low bandgap value up to 1.28&#8197;eV. The dyes, according to the different end functionalization, show a preferential unipolar charge transport behaviour with electron and hole mobility up, respectively, 4.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;2 and 2.3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s. Interestingly, in a blend configuration of the two best performant dyes, a well balanced ambipolar transport was observed.







Abstract
Three novel diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based small molecules have been synthesized and characterized in terms of their chemical&#8208;physical, electrochemical and electrical properties. All the molecules consist of a central DPP electron acceptor core symmetrically functionalized with donor bi&#8208;thienyl moieties and flanked in the terminal positions by three different auxiliary electron&#8208;acceptor groups. This kind of molecular structure, characterized by an alternation of electron acceptor and donor groups, was purposely designed to provide a significant absorption at the longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum: when analysed as thin films, in fact, the dyes absorb well over 800&#8197;nm and exhibit a narrow optical bandgap down to 1.28&#8197;eV. A detailed DFT analysis provides useful information on the electronic structure of the dyes and on the features of the main optical transitions. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been fabricated by depositing the DPP dyes as active layers from solution: the different end&#8208;functionalization of the dyes had an effect on the charge&#8208;transport properties with two of the dyes acting as n&#8208;type semiconductors (electron mobility up to 4.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s) and the third one as a p&#8208;type semiconductor (hole mobility up to 2.3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s). Interestingly, well&#8208;balanced ambipolar transistors were achieved by blending the most performant n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type dyes with hole and electron mobility in the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s

         <title>Partial Phosphorization: A Strategy to Improve Some Performance(s) of Thiolated Metal Nanoclusters Without Notable Reduction of Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial phosphorization strategy is introduced to improve the catalytic and PL performances of thiolated metal nanoclusters without notable reduction of stability, by illustrating the partial phosphorization of Au23(SC6H11)16 and its performances improvement. The transformation intermediates were captured and identified, throwing light on the understanding of the non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction.







Abstract
Thiolates endow metal nanoclusters with stability while sometimes inhibit the catalytic activity due to the strong M&#8722;S interaction (M: metal atom). To improve the catalytic activity and keep the stability to some extent, one strategy is the partial phosphorization of thiolated metal nanoclusters. This is demonstrated by successful partial phosphorization of Au23(SC6H11)16 and by revealing that the products Au22(SC6H11)14(PPh3)2 and Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4, with varied degree of phosphorization, both show excellent activity in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioanisole without notable reduction of stability. Furthermore, Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 exhibits better photoluminescence performance than the mother nanocluster Au23(SC6H11)16, indicating that partial phosphorization can also improve some other performance(s) except for the catalytic performance. The intermediates Au22&#8208;xCux(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 (x=1, 2) in the transformation from Au23(SC6H11)16 (Au22(SC6H11)14(PPh3)2) to Au22(SC6H11)12(PPh3)4 were captured and identified by mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which throws light on the understanding of the non&#8208;alloyed anti&#8208;galvanic reaction.

Chemical reactivity results in an in&#8208;situ linker modification and a switch of dimensionality with light involving cocrystals of diboronic acids and bipyridines.







Abstract
Cocrystallizations of diboronic acids [1,3&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (1,3&#8208;bdba), 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (1,4&#8208;bdba) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;biphenyldiboronic acid (4,4&#8217;&#8208;bphdba)] and bipyridines [1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (bpe) and 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpeta)] generated the hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cocrystals [(1,4&#8208;bdba)(bpe)2] (1), [(1,4&#8208;bdba)(bpeta)2] (2), [(1,3&#8208;bdba)(bpe)2(H2O)2] (3) and [(1,3&#8208;bdba)(bpeta)2(H2O)] (4), wherein 1,3&#8208;bdba involved hydrated assemblies. The linear extended 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bphdba exhibited the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [(4,4'&#8208;bphdba)(bpe)] (5) and [(4,4'&#8208;bphdba&#8208;me)(bpeta)] (6). For 6, a hemiester was generated by an in&#8208;situ linker transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed all structures to be sustained by B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, B(O)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The cocrystals comprise 1D, 2D, and 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with components that display reactivities upon cocrystal formation and within the solids. In 1 and 3, the C=C bonds of the bpe molecules undergo a [2+2] photodimerization. UV radiation of each compound resulted in quantitative conversion of bpe into cyclobutane tpcb. The reactivity involving 1 occurred via 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation. Our work supports the feasibility of the diboronic acids as formidable structural and reactivity building blocks for cocrystal construction.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Donor State Destabilisation &#8211; A New Route to Panchromatically Absorbing Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(I) and two chelating, anionic polymethine&#8208;type ligands form a novel type of photoactive cuprate. The ligands induce the destabilisation of the Cu(I)&#8208;based donor states and act themselves as acceptors. This leads to an unusually broad and intense absorption spectrum with metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer transitions from the visible to near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
The intense absorption of light to covering a large part of the visible spectrum is highly desirable for solar energy conversion schemes. To this end, we have developed novel anionic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) complexes (cuprates), which feature intense, panchromatic light absorption properties throughout the visible spectrum and into the NIR region with extinction coefficients up to 28,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Steady&#8208;state absorption, (spectro)electrochemical and theoretical investigations reveal low energy (Vis to NIR) metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands, which are a consequence of destabilized copper&#8208;based donor states. These high&#8208;lying copper&#8208;based states are induced by the &#963;&#8208;donation of the chelating anionic ligands, which also feature low energy acceptor states. The optical properties are reflected in very low, copper&#8208;based oxidation potentials and three ligand&#8208;based reduction events. These electronic features reveal a new route to panchromatically absorbing Cu(I) complexes.

         <title>A Nonaqueous Redox&#8208;Matched Flow Battery with Charge Storage in Insoluble Polymer Beads**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new redox&#8208;flow battery architecture, the redox&#8208;matched flow battery, wherein charge is stored on redox&#8208;active moieties covalently tethered to non&#8208;circulating, insoluble polymer beads and charge is transferred between the electrodes and the beads via soluble mediators with redox potentials matched to the active moieties on the beads. This enables high energy densities without crossover of bead&#8208;bound active material.







Abstract
We describe the nonaqueous redox&#8208;matched flow battery (RMFB), where charge is stored on redox&#8208;active moieties covalently tethered to non&#8208;circulating, insoluble polymer beads and charge is transferred between the electrodes and the beads via soluble mediators with redox potentials matched to the active moieties on the beads. The RMFB reported herein uses ferrocene and viologen derivatives bound to crosslinked polystyrene beads. Charge storage in the beads leads to a high (approximately 1.0&#8211;1.7&#8201;M) effective concentration of active material in the reservoirs while preventing crossover of that material. The relatively low concentration of soluble mediators (15&#8197;mM) eliminates the need for high&#8208;solubility molecules to create high energy density batteries. Nernstian redox exchange between the beads and redox&#8208;matched mediators was fast relative to the cycle time of the RMFB. This approach is generalizable to many different redox&#8208;active moieties via attachment to the versatile Merrifield resin.

         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited fluorophores exhibiting large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections and high fluorescence efficiency are highly pursued. Herein, two 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diamino&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;diboryl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithienyls are reported which are characterized by a quadrupolar structure and display good fluorescence efficiency and large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections reaching 473&#8197;GM.







Abstract
The quest for fluorophores exhibiting large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections and high fluorescence efficiency is an important topic. Two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithienyl derivatives are disclosed which contain two N,N&#8208;disubstituted amino and two dimesitylboryl groups at 3,3&#8217;&#8208; and 5,5&#8217;&#8208;positions, respectively. Despite the great steric effect of amino groups, the bithienyl skeleton still adopts a coplanar geometry. Herein, they are characterized by a quadrupolar structure and display good fluorescence efficiency and large two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections up to 473&#8197;GM.

         <title>Dynamic control of microbial movement by photoswitchable ATP antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonsits showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an  in vitro  dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the  trans  and  cis  photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  . We found that the  trans  and  cis  isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with A Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) could suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8208;NHC) with Fe&#8208;N  x  sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1C, the specific capacity is 1079 mA h g  &#8208;1  and maintains a low loss of 0.076% per cycle within 500 cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4C, a high capacity of 824 mA h g  &#8208;1  is still achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generalizing the aromatic &#948;&#8208;amino acid foldamer helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility,  e.g.  due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and  1  H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature,  i.e.  the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp  3  centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Anthracene&#8208;Centered Large PAH Diimides and Conjugated Polymers**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzannulation reaction followed by intramolecular arylation has been applied to the synthesis of a PAH diimide (BFDI) featuring a central anthracene moiety. When BFDI is coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two polymers with significantly red&#8208;shifted, broad absorptions are prepared, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI and charge&#8208;transfer characteristic of the polymer backbones.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures with suitable electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are useful building blocks for developing optical and electron&#8208;transporting materials. Here, we report the application of a double benzannulation process to the syntheses of PAH diimides with enlarged &#960;&#8208;frameworks featuring a central anthracene moiety. The preparations are realized by copper&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of ethynyl&#8208;substituted aromatic dicarboximide to 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)terephthalaldehyde, followed by intramolecular photocyclization or direct arylation via Heck cross coupling. A central symmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;k:4,5&#8208;k&#8242;]&#8208;bis(fluoranthene)&#8208;3,4,12,13&#8208;tetracarboxyl diimide (BFDI) is acquired, with the single crystal structure revealing its completely planar polycyclic skeleton. Such a shape&#8208;persistent PAH expectedly exhibits a tendency to stack face&#8208;to&#8208;face and forms J&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, BFDI can be difunctionalized site&#8208;selectively at the reactive 9 and 10 positions of the anthracene unit and then applied to prepare conjugated polymers. When coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two polymers with significantly broadened absorption bands extended to the near&#8208;infrared regime are obtained, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI unit.

         <title>Stereodivergent Desymmetrization of Simple Dicarboxylates via Branch&#8208;Selective Pd/Cu Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd/Cu catalyzed stereodivergent desymmetrization of unsubstituted allylic dicarboxylates was developed and the corresponding products could be generated in excellent yields with good stereoselectivity. Notably, the reaction favored branch&#8208;selectivity. Large scale experiment and the transformations of products indicated the potential utility of this reaction. In addition, computational studies revealed that the greater electrophilicity of branch carbon in the &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd intermediate and the weak noncovalent interactions among the substrates and the catalysts contributed to the high branch&#8208;selectivity of this reaction.







Abstract
Asymmetric desymmetrization has been demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for building stereocenters in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, a Pd/Cu catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization reaction with a simple geminal dicarboxylate is reported. A wide scope of imino esters bearing an aryl or heteroaromatic group were compatible with this bimetallic catalytic system. The reactions proceeded smoothly, giving the desired products in good yields with high to excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 branched:linear, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Notably, the reaction favored branched selectivity, which is unusual for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. In addition, the standard product could be easily transformed to other valuable molecules such as chiral allylic alcohols, carbamates, and organic boron compounds. Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to explain the origin of the branched selectivity.

         <title>Promoting Proton Transfer and Stabilizing Intermediates in Catalytic Water Oxidation via Hydrophobic Outer Sphere Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outer coordination sphere engineering: A series of pocket&#8208;shaped catalysts with well&#8208;defined outer coordination environments were synthesized and characterized, showing that the hydrophobic outer coordination sphere could stabilize high&#8208;valent intermediates and promote proton transfer during water oxidation catalysis. The introduction of hydrophobic outer&#8208;sphere interactions is therefore envisaged as an effective strategy to tune other related proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions.







Abstract
The outer coordination sphere of metalloenzyme often plays an important role in its high catalytic activity, however, this principle is rarely considered in the design of man&#8208;made molecular catalysts. Herein, four Ru&#8208;bda (bda=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) based molecular water oxidation catalysts with well&#8208;defined outer spheres are designed and synthesized. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the hydrophobic environment around the Ru center could lead to thermodynamic stabilization of the high&#8208;valent intermediates and kinetic acceleration of the proton transfer process during catalytic water oxidation. By this outer sphere stabilization, a 6&#8208;fold rate increase for water oxidation catalysis has been achieved.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Unique Platforms to Gain Insight of &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions for the Removal of Organic Dyes from Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic framework, with functional channels decorated with &#8722;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, does not only exhibit outstanding capture properties for organic dyes but also establishes that sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions play a prominent role with the help of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The combination of high crystallinity and rich host&#8208;guest chemistry in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have situated them in an advantageous position, with respect to traditional porous materials, to gain insight on specific weak noncovalent supramolecular interactions. In particular, sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions are known to play a key role in the biological activity of living beings as well as on relevant molecular recognitions processes. However, so far, they have been barely explored. Here, we describe both how the combination of the intrinsic features of MOFs, especially the possibility of using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXRD), can be an extremely valuable tool to gain insight on sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions, and how their rational exploitation can be enormously useful in the efficient removal of harmful organic molecules from aquatic ecosystems. Thus, we have used a MOF, prepared from the amino acid L&#8208;methionine and possessing channels decorated with &#8722;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, to remove a family of organic dyes at very low concentrations (10&#8197;ppm) from water. This MOF is able to efficiently capture the four dyes in a very fast manner, reaching within five minutes nearly the maximum removal. Remarkably, the crystal structure of the different organic dyes within MOFs channels could be determined by SCXRD. This has enabled us to directly visualize the important role sulfur &#963;&#8208;hole interactions play on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, representing one of the first studies on the rational exploitation of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions for water remediation.

This MOF is able to efficiently capture the four dyes in a very fast manner, reaching within five minutes nearly the maximum removal. Remarkably, the crystal structure of the different organic dyes within MOFs channels could be determined by SCXRD. This has enabled us to directly visualize the important role sulfur &#963;-hole interactions play on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, representing one of the first studies on the rational exploitation of &#963;-hole interactions for water remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Relativistic Spin&#8211;Orbit Electronegativity and the Chemical Bond Between a Heavy Atom and a Light Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relativistic spin&#8211;orbit electronegativity and the periodic table. The relativistic spin&#8211;orbit coupling associated with the presence of a heavy atom in a molecule is shown to have a significant effect on the electron charge density, HA&#8722;LA bond distance, and NMR shielding at a neighboring light atom. This phenomenon is transparently interpreted across the periodic table of elements by the SO&#8208;induced rearrangement of the electron density and electronegativity of the HA.







Abstract
Relativistic effects are known to alter the chemical bonds and spectroscopic properties of heavy&#8208;element compounds. In this work, we introduce the concept of spin&#8211;orbit (SO) electronegativity of a heavy atom, as reflected by an SO&#8208;induced change in the interatomic distance between the heavy atom (HA) and a neighboring light atom (LA). We provide a transparent interpretation of these SO effects by using the concept of spin&#8211;orbit electron deformation density (SO&#8208;EDD). Spin&#8211;orbit coupling at the HA induces rearrangement of the electron density for the scalar&#8208;relativistically optimized geometry that, in turn, exerts a new force on the LA. The resulting expansion or contraction of the HA&#8722;LA bond depends on the nature and electron configuration of the HA. In addition, we quantify the change in atomic electronegativity induced by SO coupling for a series of hydrides, thereby complementing the SO&#8208;EDD picture. The trends in the SO&#8208;induced electronegativity and the HA&#8722;LA bond length across the periodic table of elements are demonstrated and interpreted, and also linked, intuitively, with the SO&#8208;induced NMR shielding at the LA.

         <title>The Varied Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity of the Germylene Phosphaketene (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO reacts with E(C6F5)3 (E=B, Al) and with alkynes or olefins, acting as either an intramolecular or intermolecular FLP controlled by the nature of electrophiles and nucleophiles generated in solution as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.







Abstract
The germylene species (CH{(CMe)(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3N)}2)GePCO 1 is shown to react with the Lewis acids (E(C6F5)3 E=B, Al). Nonetheless, 1 participates in FLP chemistry with electron deficient alkynes or olefins, acting as an intramolecular FLP. In contrast, in the presence of B(C6F5)3 and an electron rich alkyne, 1 behaves as Ge&#8208;based nucleophile to effect intermolecular FLP addition to the alkyne. This reactivity demonstrates that the reaction pathway is controlled by the nature of the electrophile and nucleophile generated in solution, as revealed by extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probe for Detecting Trimethylamine Based on Intermolecular Charge Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
A new kind of small organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore molecule (ZS&#8208;1010) was developed as a NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probe for trimethylamine (TMA) detection based on intermolecular charge transfer. This is the first example of TMA fluorescent probe in the NIR&#8208;II window showing deep penetration, fast response speed, high selectivity and pH stability.







Abstract
A new kind of small organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophore molecule (ZS&#8208;1010) based on intermolecular charge transfer was developed as a NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probe for trimethylamine (TMA) detection, which is important for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and diabetes. ZS&#8208;1010 has a strong push&#8211;pull electron system composed of electron donor unit and electron acceptor unit, exhibiting strong absorption and emission in the NIR&#8208;II region. When mixed with TMA which possesses strong electron&#8208;donating characteristics, the push&#8211;pull system of ZS&#8208;1010 will be affected along with the dipole moment change, leading to the quenching of fluorescence. This is the first example of TMA fluorescent probe in the NIR&#8208;II window showing deep penetration, fast response speed, high selectivity and pH stability.

         <title>Metalloimmunotherapy with Rhodium and Ruthenium Complexes: Targeting Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium and ruthenium complexes are revealed as promising new agents for metalloimmunotherapy. Leads were identified that kill immunosuppressive M2 macrophages selectively, sensitize macrophage/cancer cell 3D co&#8208;culture spheroids to a chemotherapeutic drug and increase cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a key event in immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) suppress the cancer immune response and are a key target for immunotherapy. The effects of ruthenium and rhodium complexes on TAMs have not been well characterized. To address this gap in the field, a panel of 22 dirhodium and ruthenium complexes were screened against three subtypes of macrophages, triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and normal breast tissue cells. Experiments were carried out in 2D and biomimetic 3D co&#8208;culture experiments with and without irradiation with blue light. Leads were identified with cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific toxicity toward macrophage subtypes, cancer cells, or both. Experiments with 3D spheroids revealed complexes that sensitized the tumor models to the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Cell surface exposure of calreticulin, a known facilitator of immunogenic cell death (ICD), was increased upon treatment, along with a concomitant reduction in the M2&#8208;subtype classifier arginase. Our findings lay a strong foundation for the future development of ruthenium&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;based chemotherapies targeting TAMs.

         <title>Design and preparation of electrocatalysts by electrodeposition for CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ), the conversion and utilization of CO  2  have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO  2  RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO  2  RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their application in CO  2  RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;induced dual phosphorescence from (o&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)borane at room temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly efficient purely organic phosphors at room temperature remains a challenge because of fast non&#8208;radiative processes and slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The majority of them emit only single component phosphorescence. Herein, we have prepared 3 isomers (  o  ,  m  ,  p  &#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)boranes. Among the 3 isomers (  o  &#8208;,  m  &#8208; and  p  &#8208;  BrTAB  ) synthesized, the  ortho  &#8208;one is the only one which shows dual phosphorescence, with a short lifetime of 0.8 ms and a long lifetime of 234 ms in the crystalline state at room temperature. Based on theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis of  o  &#8208;  BrTAB  ,  the short lifetime component is ascribed to the T  1  M  state of the monomer which emits the higher energy phosphorescence. The long&#8208;lived, lower energy phosphorescence emission is attributed to the T  1  A  state of an aggregate, with multiple intermolecular interactions existing in crystalline  o  &#8208;  BrTAB  inhibiting nonradiative decay and stabilizing the triplet states efficiently.</dc:description>

The reaction is carried out in the absence of metal catalysts or other additives, and its stereoselectivity can be tuned by selecting appropriate solvent mixtures. The reaction's scope and tolerance towards functional groups, including light&#8208;sensitive halogens, free acids and alcohols, were studied, providing reliable access to a wide variety of  &#946;,&#947;  &#8208;unsaturated ketones.

         <title>Topologically Interlocked Minicircles as Probes of DNA Topology and DNA&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the frame: Topologically interlocked minicircle DNA rotaxanes and catenanes inside DNA origami frames have been designed and synthesized. With these assemblies, the DNA topology and its influence on DNA&#8211;protein interactions were examined by enzymatic restriction. Facile cleavage by restriction enzymes was observed for flexible linear duplexes, whereas free or interlocked minicircles were reluctant to split, thus indicating the role of the topology. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Morii et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200108).

         <title>Impact of Intermolecular Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in a CuI8PdII1 Discrete Assembly: Conformers&#8217; Geometries and Stimuli&#8208;Sensitive Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study highlights the crucial role played by intermolecular non&#8208;covalent weak&#8208;interactions in the conformer selection, the solid&#8208;state organization and the photophysical properties observed in a series of phases of a CuI8PdII2 multimetallic assembly. Rationalization of the structure/properties relationships allows understanding their mechanical and thermal stimuli&#8208;sensitive responses.







Abstract
A new highly solid&#8208;state luminescent phase of a previously reported weakly luminescent CuI8PdII1 dicationic assembly is reported revealing the high geometrical versatility of this moiety that importantly alters its luminescent properties. This very minor new species Bc is based on a different conformer scaffold than the one encountered in the previously reported Bo form and, essentially differs from Bo by displaying shorter CuI&#8208;CuI intermetallic distances. DFT calculations allow concluding that the predominance in the solid&#8208;state of the weakly luminescent and less stable Bo phase is due to the extra stability induced by a larger number of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;CH interactions in its crystalline packing and not by the intrinsic stability of the CuI8PdII1 dicationic moiety. Calculations also revealed that a more stable conformation Bcalc is expected in vacuum, which bears a different distribution of CuI&#8208;CuI intermetallic distances than the dications in Bo and Bc phases. Taking into account that the geometrical alterations are associated to drastic changes of luminescence properties, this confer to the CuI8PdII1 assembly high potentiality as stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescent materials. Indeed, by applying mechanical or thermal stress to samples of Bo phase, new phases Bg and Bm, respectively, were obtained. Alterations of the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of these new species compared to those recorded for Bo are reported together with a combined experimental and computed study of the structures/properties relationships observed in these phases.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Heterogeneous Thermocatalysis Caused by Catalyst Wettability Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis caused by catalyst wettability regulation are summarized, including the introduction of hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hybrid hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, and superaerophilicity. Relevant reactions are classified and described in detail according to the reason for the performance improvement. Studies of utilizing superaerophilicity to improve heterogeneous thermocatalytic performance have been included in the system for the first time, forming a comparatively comprehensive review in this field as yet.







Abstract
Catalyst wettability regulation has emerged as an attractive approach for high catalytic performance for the past few years. By introducing appropriate wettability, the molecule diffusion of reactants and products can be enhanced, leading to high activity. Besides this, undesired molecules are isolated for high selectivity of target products and long&#8208;term stability of catalyst. Herein, we summarize wettability&#8208;induced high&#8208;performance heterogeneous thermocatalysis in recent years, including hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hybrid hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity, and superaerophilicity. Relevant reactions are further classified and described according to the reason for the performance improvement. It should be pointed out that studies of utilizing superaerophilicity to improve heterogeneous thermocatalytic performance have been included for the first time, so this is a comparatively comprehensive review in this field as yet.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#946;&#8208;Fused BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly versatile synthetic route to symmetric and asymmetric &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY molecules possessing a butterfly shape is described. These dyes exhibit very attractive optical properties such as panchromatic absorption and effective emission in the NIR region.







Abstract
Here, we report the synthesis and properties of heterosubtituted &#945;&#946;&#8208;fused BODIPY fluorophores. The compounds were obtained in good yields by sequential and selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahalo&#8208;BODIPY, allowing the introduction of different substituents at the 3,5 and 2,6 positions of the BODIPY ring. The final fused compounds were synthesized using oxidative cyclisation with ferrous chloride. The fully fused compounds show a strong bathochromically shifted emission along with a hyperchromic shift of the absorption maxima. The fluorescence quantum yields remain relatively large for compounds emitting in this wavelength range. Computational studies have been carried out to fully understand the photophysical behaviour of these dyes.

         <title>Polycations Stabilised by Borosulfates: [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and the One&#8208;Dimensional Metal [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A different dimension: The borosulfates [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) were obtained through the reaction of AuCl3 with and in SO3. The [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; anions serve as charge compensation for cluster&#8208;like and chain&#8208;like polycations. The latter are found in [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) and resemble one&#8208;dimensional metals according to DFT&#8208;based quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. This is confirmed experimentally by polarisation microscopy.







Abstract
(SO4)&#8208;rich silicate analogue borosulfates are able to stabilise cationic cluster&#8208;like and chain&#8208;like aggregates. Single crystals of [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) were obtained by solvothermal reaction with SO3, and the electronic properties were investigated by means of density functional theory&#8211;based calculations. [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] exhibits a cluster&#8208;like cation, and the cationic gold&#8208;chloride strands in [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) are found to resemble one&#8208;dimensional metallic wires. This is confirmed by polarisation microscopy.

         <title>Probing the Potential of Hitherto Unexplored Base&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes in Dinitrogen Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite decades of intense research, metal&#8208;free binding of N2 is still a tantalizing goal. We have computationally explored di&#8208;coordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes as candidates for N2 capture. Besides identifying key borylene&#8211;N2 adducts with low activation barriers, we reveal that the reaction exergonicity is linearly dependent on the natural charge at boron. These findings pave the way for the design of boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications in small&#8208;molecule activation. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fantuzzi, H. Braunschweig, A.&#8197;K. Phukan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104123). Cover designed by F.F.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>

         <dc:description>In a leap toward anion separation that uses only energy input for binding and release cycles, we report herein a new class of photoswitchable anion receptors featuring a diiminoguanidinium functionality that displays more than five orders of magnitude switched&#8208;off change in binding strength towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion, upon photoirradiation with UV light. E , E &#8208;2pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium cation, synthesized as the triflate salt, binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in DMSO&#8208; d 6 owing to its bidentate guanidinium hydrogen bonding that can chelate the O&#8211;S&#8211;O edge of sulfate. The anion&#8208;binding site is essentially shut off upon photoisomerization to the Z , Z isomer, by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, as supported by anion&#8208;binding titrations, theoretical calculations, and X&#8208;ray structural analysis. This approach will allow the development of advanced anion separation cycles that use only energy input and generate no chemical waste, and thus address challenging chemical separation problems in a more sustainable way.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of an Asymmetric Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present that an asymmetric reaction can be implemented and refined in a helical cavity of aromatic oligoamide sequences. These sequences bearing a chiral inducer can fold into helical structures with absolute control of the helical sense, whereby a ketone substrate covalently linked in the cavity can be asymmetrically reduced to diastereomers. The diastereoselectivity of the reduction reaction is highly dependent on the shielding efficiency of the helical cavity. Iterative modifications of the sequence, such as addition and replacement of monomers, can fine&#8208;tune the cavity for realizing the asymmetric reaction, thereby progressive increasing the diastereomeric excess up to 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interaction, but there are only very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands  L1  and  L2  with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Coordination of  L1  and  L2  with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;1  ) and two&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;2  ) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic  cobalt(II) ions  and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of metal&#8208;radical approach toward magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Gold&#8208;Framed Palladium Nanocubes for Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold complexes: the putative intermediate in Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes does not protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.</dc:description>

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH 2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH 2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;* C=S and &#960;* C=Se orbitals, than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;* C=O . The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen n p and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8211;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, not the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide&#8217;s hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomeric stereoauxiliary cleavage of the C&#8208;N bond of D&#8208;glucosamine for the preparation of imidazo[1,5&#8208;&#945;]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds of alkyl primary amines in sustainable compounds of biomass  via  a metal&#8208;free pathway and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines are still highly challenging. Despite tremendous progress in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines over the past decade, many of them can still not be efficiently prepared. Herein, we report an anomeric stereoauxiliary approach for the synthesis of a wide range of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines after cleaving the C&#8722;N bond of D&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of D&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage through a seven&#8208;membered ring transition state. Using this novel method, a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives (more than 80 examples) were synthesized from pyridine ketones (including para&#8208;dipyridine ketone) and aldehydes (including para&#8208;dialdehyde). Moreover, imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines derivatives containing diverse important deuterated C(sp  2  )&#8722;H and C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds were also efficiently achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R = NH  2  ) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R = NO  2  ) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L  1  )(L  2  )]  n  (  1  ) and [Zn(L  1  )(L  3  )]  n  (  2  ) [L  1  = 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole, L  2  = Pbim 5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L  3  = 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of  1  revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954; = 65.5 at 1 kHz), while compound  2  displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954; = 110.3 at 1 kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH  2  and NO  2  substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO  2  and NH  2  but the effect is more pronounced. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Intramolecular P/Al&#8208;Based Frustrated Lewis Pairs via Aluminum&#8208;Tin&#8208;Exchange and their Reactivity toward CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exchange of the players stannane and alane provides a viable route to intramolecular FLPs with large separations between Lewis acidic aluminum und Lewis basic phosphane functions. Neutral molecules occupy the space between the two moieties and are easily displaced by approaching substrates like CO2, which is spanned in the reaction pocket &#8208; particularly strongly if the residues at the Al centers correspond to C6F5.







Abstract
Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) composed of acidic alane and basic phosphane functions, separated by a xanthene linker, can be prepared through the corresponding Me3Sn derivative and methyl aluminum compounds with elimination of Me4Sn. This way MeClAl&#8208;, Cl2Al&#8208; and (C6F5)2Al&#8208; moieties could be introduced and the resulting FLPs are stabilized by a further equivalent of the alane precursors. In contact with the FLPs CO2 is bound via the C atom at the phosphane functions and the two O atoms at the Al centers. The residues at the latter determine the binding strength. Hence, in case of MeClAl CO2 capture occurs at higher pressure and under ambient conditions CO2 is released again, while for Cl2Al and (C6F5)2Al CO2 binding becomes irreversible. The results of DFT calculations rationalize these findings by the high thermodynamic stabilization in case of more electronegative residues, which concomitantly lead to higher barriers, and in case of (C6F5)2Al further stabilization is achieved through a low reorganization energy.

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) composed of acidic alane and basic phosphane functions, separated by a xanthene linker, can be prepared through the corresponding Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn derivative and methyl aluminum compounds with elimination of Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn. This way MeClAl-, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al- and (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al- moieties could be introduced and the resulting FLPs are stabilized by a further equivalent of the alane precursors. In contact with the FLPs CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is bound via the C atom at the phosphane functions and the two O atoms at the Al centers. The residues at the latter determine the binding strength. Hence, in case of MeClAl CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture occurs at higher pressure and under ambient conditions CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is released again, while for Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al and (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding becomes irreversible. The results of DFT calculations rationalize these findings by the high thermodynamic stabilization in case of more electronegative residues, which concomitantly lead to higher barriers, and in case of (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al further stabilization is achieved through a low reorganization energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DoE&#8208;Driven Development of an Organocatalytic Enantioselective Addition of Acetaldehyde to Nitrostyrenes in Water**
</title>

         <dc:description>
It's in the design: Moving from organic solvents to water is not always an easy task, especially when a lot of variables need to be screened. The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed Michael addition of acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes in water was developed by using a rational approach, via chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation. This way it was possible to screen 9 different parameters, their interaction with each other, and the full chemical space, with minimum experiments in an efficient manner.







Abstract
The development of an enantioselective enamine&#8208;catalysed addition of masked acetaldehyde to nitroalkenes via a rational approach helped to move away from the use of chloroform. The presented research allows the use of water as a reaction medium, therefore improving the industrial relevance of a protocol to access very important pharmaceutical intermediates. Critical to the success is the use of chemometrics&#8208;assisted &#8216;Design of Experiments&#8217; (DoE) optimisation during the development of the presented new synthetic approach, which allows to investigate the chemical space in a rational way.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Formed Stable PbI2/NiOx Interface with Increased Ni3+ Centers for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;formed PbI2/NiOx interface to stabilize the Ni3+&#8208;rich NiOx hole transport layers is proposed. Combined with ultraviolet ozone treatment and sequential deposition, the density of Ni3+ centers was greatly increased and could be stabilized by the PbI2 interface. These merits contribute coordinately to the better charge transfer capability and the reduction of charge recombination across the PbI2/NiOx interface.







Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is a promising hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite photovoltaics owing to its chemical stability and low cost. However, most NiOx based solar cells deliver relatively weak performance because of its insufficient electrical property and interfacial contact. In this work, a self&#8208;formed PbI2/NiOx interface was developed to stabilize the Ni3+ centers, which was beneficial for electrical transport and band alignment in perovskite solar cells. Combined with ultraviolet ozone treatment (UVO) and sequential deposition, the density of Ni3+ centers was greatly increased and could be stabilized by the PbI2 interface. These merits contributed coordinately to the fast hole extraction and low energy loss across the PbI2/NiOx interface, yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 19&#8201;%.

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of the organic building units of MOFs towards selective detection of a targeted metal cation (Fe3+) has been demonstrated by systematic screening by varying the number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites in a series of isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). All three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present a quenching response towards Fe3+ ions in water; however, only UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas the emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;K. Ghosh et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104175).

         <dc:description>We have discovered dual (i.e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8208;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes via three&#8208;point annulation of naphthalene&#8217;s moiety. The versatility of the developed method is demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Ligand Substituent Effects on &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Contributions to Fe&#8722;N Bonds in Spin Crossover FeII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
EDA&#8208;NOCV quantitatively probes bonding in 16 [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes as para&#8208;X substituent goes EWG&#8594;EDG. Calculated Fe&#8722;N sigma bond stabilisation, &#916;Eorb,&#963;, for the low spin complexes strongly correlates with: experimental spin crossover temperature T1/2 (R2=0.82), calculated chemical shift &#948;15N of free bppX (R2=0.95) and Hammett parameter &#963;p+(X) (R2=0.88); as well as with Mulliken NA(px) (R2=0.84) and NA(pz) populations (R2=0.93).







Abstract
The effect of para&#8208;substituent X on the electronic structure of sixteen tridentate 4&#8208;X&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl))&#8208;pyridine (bppX) ligands and the corresponding solution spin crossover [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes is analysed further, to supply quantitative insights into the effect of X on the &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the Fe&#8208;NA(pyridine) bonds. EDA&#8208;NOCV on the sixteen LS complexes revealed that neither &#916;Eorb,&#963;+&#960; (R2=0.48) nor &#916;Eorb,&#960; (R2=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T1/2 values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that &#916;Eorb,&#963; correlates well (R2=0.82) and implies that as X changes from EDG&#8594;EWG (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better &#963;&#8208;donor. This counter&#8208;intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the NA atomic orbitals: NA(px) involved in the Fe&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond vs. the perpendicular NA(pz) employed in the ligand aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. As X changes EDG&#8594;EWG, the electron population on NA(pz) decreases, making it a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor, whilst that in NA(px) increases, making it a better &#963;&#8208;bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T1/2 as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co&#8208;workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the para&#8208;X substituents on the
T1/2 values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M&#8594;L &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates in these M&#8722;L bonds. Here the quantitative EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis of the M&#8722;L bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M&#8722;L &#963;&#8208;versus &#960;&#8208;bonding in determining the observed T1/2, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the &#963;&#8208;bonding.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDA-NOCV&lt;/b&gt; quantitatively probes bonding in 16 [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;bpp&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes as &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; substituent goes &lt;b&gt;EWG&lt;/b&gt;&#8594;&lt;b&gt;EDG&lt;/b&gt;. Calculated Fe&#8722;N sigma bond stabilisation, &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;

   &lt;i&gt;orb&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, for the low spin complexes strongly correlates with: experimental spin crossover temperature T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.82), calculated chemical shift &#948;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N of free &lt;b&gt;bpp&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.95) and Hammett parameter &#963;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;) (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.88); as well as with Mulliken &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.84) and &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) populations (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.93).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituent &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; on the electronic structure of sixteen tridentate 4-&lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt;-(2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl))-pyridine (&lt;b&gt;bpp&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) ligands and the corresponding solution spin crossover [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;b&gt;bpp&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes is analysed further, to supply quantitative insights into the effect of &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; on the &#963;-donor and &#960;-acceptor character of the Fe-&lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(pyridine) bonds. EDA-NOCV on the sixteen &lt;i&gt;LS&lt;/i&gt; complexes revealed that neither &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;orb,&#963;+&#960;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.48) nor &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;orb&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;orb&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; correlates well (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.82) and implies that as &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; changes from &lt;b&gt;EDG&lt;/b&gt;&#8594;&lt;b&gt;EWG&lt;/b&gt; (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better &#963;-donor. This counter-intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; atomic orbitals: &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) involved in the Fe&#8722;N &#963;-bond vs. the perpendicular &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) employed in the ligand aromatic &#960;-system. As &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; changes &lt;b&gt;EDG&lt;/b&gt;&#8594;&lt;b&gt;EWG&lt;/b&gt;, the electron population on &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) decreases, making it a better &#960;-acceptor, whilst that in &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) increases, making it a better &#963;-bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co-workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; substituents on the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M&#8594;L &#960;-backdonation dominates in these M&#8722;L bonds. Here the quantitative EDA-NOCV analysis of the M&#8722;L bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M&#8722;L &#963;-versus &#960;-bonding in determining the observed T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the &#963;-bonding. Furthermore, our results are in perfect agreement with the &#916;E(HS-LS) vs. &#963;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Total Synthesis of Suberitines A&#8211;D Featuring Tunable Biomimetic Late&#8208;Stage Oxidative Dearomatization and Acetalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of suberitines A&#8211;D has been accomplished using cascade Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cationic cyclization, eliminative aromatization, Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization, and conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated regioselective oxidative dearomatization/O,O&#8208;acetalization. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox transformations of these marine natural products was supported by the isolation and characterization of the synthetic intermediate.







Abstract
Aaptaminoids are a unique family of marine alkaloids bearing a benzo[de][1,6]&#8208;naphthyridine core. This work describes the first total synthesis of suberitines A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), four typical dimeric natural aaptaminoids, employing a step&#8208;saving bidirectional strategy. Key methods applied in the total synthesis include a cationic cascade to construct the bis&#8208;isoquinoline(s) with Hendrickson reagent&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization and eliminative aromatization, and a Bronsted acid&#8208;promoted Vilsmeier cyclization to generate the naphthyridine(s). The conditionally tunable PIDA&#8208;mediated oxidative dearomatization and subsequent methanolysis or hydrolysis successfully served as a powerful biomimetic tool to elaborate the essential oxygenated functionalities of suberitines A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4) in proper solvent&#8208;combinations at the final stage of total synthesis. The biomimetic proposal employed in the late&#8208;stage redox interchanges of related natural products was eventually supported by the isolation of synthetic intermediate 23&#8201;a as a natural product from the same natural source. Biological screening revealed that five of the synthetic samples including two natural suberitines and three full&#8208;skeleton natural product&#8208;like intermediates exhibited low micromolar inhibitory activities against the growth of cancer cell line K562.

         <title>The Influence of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Structural Defects on Adsorption and Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, adsorption properties of theUiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic framework were investigated, with particular emphasis on the influence of structural defects. A series of UiO&#8208;66 samples were synthesized and characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques. Type I adsorption isotherms for low&#8208;temperature adsorption of N2 and Ar showed that micropore volume and specific surface area significantly increase with the number of defects. Adsorption of hexane isomers in UiO&#8208;66 was studied by means of quasi&#8208;equilibrated temperature&#8208;programmed desorption and adsorption (QE&#8208;TPDA) experimental and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. QE&#8208;TPDA profiles revealed that only defect&#8208;free UiO&#8208;66 exhibits distinct two adsorption states. This technique also yielded high&#8208;quality adsorption isobars that were successfully recreated using Grand&#8208;Canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulations, which, however, required refinement of the existing force fields. The calculations demonstrated the detailed mechanism of adsorption and separation of hexane isomers in the UiO&#8208;66 structure. The preferred tetrahedral cages provide suitable voids for bulky molecules, which is the reason for unusual "reverse" selectivity of UiO&#8208;66 towards di&#8208;branched alkanes. Interconnection of the tetrahedral cavities due to missing organic linkers greatly reduces the selectivity of the defected material.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Intracellular excessive glutathione (GSH) consumes the cytotoxic  1  O  2  significantly, restricting the development and efficacy of  1  O  2  &#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). To face with this challenge, herein a heterogeneous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanohybrid was sequentially fabricated with porous coordination network&#8208;typed MOF as the core and photosensitizer, and Cu  II  &#8208;centered zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 as shell encapsulating cyanine 3&#8208;labelled siRNA. Upon internalized by cells and activated by GSH, the outer shell dissociated and released dye&#8208;labelled siRNA for GSH imaging and subsequent gene silencing in a controllable way. Meanwhile, the photosensitizing core was synchronously unlocked for the GSH&#8208;depleted intensified PDT along with the dissociation. The heterogeneous nanosystem achieved efficiently imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;gene theranostics with the cell apoptosis of 81.3%, which was 2.2 folded than that without PDT. Overall, the core&#8208;shell heterogeneous MOF hybrids exerted effective photodynamic&#8208;gene synergetic therapeutic efficacy by surmounting GSH&#8208;associated resistance, and paved a new way for designing intracellular stimulus&#8208;activated theranostic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Spectral Tuning Mechanism in Proteorhodopsin: The Dominant Role of Electrostatics Instead of Chromophore Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a photoactive proton pump found in marine bacteria. There are two phenotypes of PR exhibiting an environmental adaptation to the ocean&#8217;s depth which tunes their maximium absorption: blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). This blue/green color&#8208;shift is controlled by a glutamine to leucine substitution at position 105 which accounts for a 20 nm shift. Typically, spectral tuning in rhodopsins is rationalized by the external point charge model but the Q105L mutation is charge neutral. To study this tuning mechanism we employed the hybrid QM/MM method with sampling from molecular dynamics. Our results reveal that the positive partial charge of glutamine near the C  14  &#8211; C  15  bond of retinal shortens the effective conjugation length of the chromophore compared to the leucine residue. The derived mechanism can be applied to explain the color regulation in other retinal proteins and can serve as a guideline for rational design of spectral shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid State and Solution Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chalcogen bonding (ChB) ability of Te is studied in symmetrical diaryl ditellurides ArTeTeAr. Among the two Te &#963;&#8208;holes, the one along the less polarized Te&#8208;Te bond was calculated as the more electropositive. This counter&#8208;intuitive situation is due to the hyperconjugation contribution from Te lone pair to the &#963;* of the adjacent Te which coincides with &#963;&#8208;hole along the more polarized Te&#8208;Ar bond. ArTeTeAr showed notable structural features in the solid state as a result of intermolecular Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Te ChB, such as a Te  4  rectangle through dimer aggregation or a triangular Te  3  motif, where one Te interacts with both Te atoms of a neighboring molecule through both its &#963;&#8208;hole and lone pair, in a slightly frustrated geometry. Lewis acidity of ArTeTeAr was also evaluated by NMR with R  3  PO as &#963;&#8208;hole acceptors in different solvents. Thus,  125  Te NMR allowed monitoring Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and delivering association constants (  K  a  ) for 1:1 adducts. The highest value of  K  a  = 90 M  &#8208;1  was measured for the adduct between ArTeTeAr bearing CF  3  groups and Et  3  PO in cyclohexane. Notably, by using  n  Bu  3  PO, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction was revealed by  19  F&#8208;  1  H HOESY showing spatial proximity between CF  3  and CH  3  of  n  Bu  3  PO.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Exploration of Furoindolizine&#8208;based Molecular Framework towards a Versatile Fluorescent Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photophysical behaviors of fluorescent molecules largely determine their major utility in biological studies. Despite their well&#8208;defined characteristics, classical fluorophores have often been challenged by their limited synthetic methodology and tunability in adjusting intrinsic optical properties. A novel heterocyclic core equipped with modular functional groups may offer the flexibility to control its photophysical properties with a minimum synthetic effort. By conducting a systematic analysis guided by quantum calculations, we proposed the furoindolizine&#8208;based molecular framework as a unique fluorescent platform capable of providing versatile photophysical properties with minimal structural modification. Furoindolizine derivatives exhibited broadly tunable photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge transfer characteristics using synergistic interaction between two functional moieties. Furthermore, this modular platform enabled us to secure live&#8208;cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report&#160;a new class of attractive intermolecular interaction between azide and ethynyl structural entities in a wide range of molecular crystals. We systematically evaluated this interaction using eleven geometrically different structural motifs which are preorganized to direct solid&#8208;state topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. Supramolecular features of azide and alkyne interaction have been mapped through various crystallographic and quantum chemical approaches. The topological analysis shows that the azide&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;alkyne interactions are manifested with the noticeable participation of electron densities. Interestingly, the reorientation of atomic polarizabilities in vicinal azide and alkyne groups upon interaction in crystals favors the soft orbital&#8208;guided TAAC reactions. Moreover, various solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase energy decomposition methods of individual azide&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;alkyne interactions summa&#8208;rize that the strength (varies from &#8208;5.7 to &#8208;30.1 kJ/mol) is primarily guided by the dispersion forces with influencing contribution from the electrostatics.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules which showed remarkable aggregation induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by the pH and temperature dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.</dc:description>

         <title>Intense Photoinduced Intervalence Charge Transfer in High&#8208;Valent Iron Mixed Phenolate/Carbene Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>We report high&#8208;valent iron complexes, supported by  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands that undergo ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) upon photoexcitation.&#160; The resulting excited states &#8211; with a lifetime in the pico&#8208;second range &#8211; feature a ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valence system and intense inter&#173;valence charge transfer bands in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region.&#160; Upon oxidation of the complex, corres&#173;ponding intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) absorptions are also observed in the ground state.&#160; We suggest that the spectroscopic hallmarks of such LMCT states provide useful tools to decipher excited state decay mechanisms in high&#8208;valent NHC complexes.&#160; Our obser&#173;vations further indicate that NHC&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands are not sufficiently strong donors to prevent the population of excited metal&#8208;centered (MC) states in high&#8208;valent iron complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyl group migration in pyranosides as studied by experimental and computational methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl group migration affects the synthesis, isolation, manipulation and purification of all acylated organic compounds containing free hydroxyl groups, in particular carbohydrates. While several isolated studies on the migration phenomenon in different buffers have been reported, comprehensive insights into the overall migration process in different monosaccharides under similar conditions have been lacking. Here, we have studied the acyl migration in different monosaccharides using five different acyl groups by a combination of experimental, kinetic and theoretical tools. The results show that the anomeric configuration in the monosaccharide has a major influence on the migration rate, together with the relative configurations of the other hydroxyl groups and the nature of the migrating acyl group. Full mechanistic model, based on computations, demonstrates that the acyl migration proceeds through an anionic stepwise mechanism with linear dependence on the [OH&#8208;] and the pKa of the hydroxyl group toward which the acyl group is migrating.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) macrocyclic dyads con&#173;sisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothio&#173;phene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para  &#8208;quinone methides ( p  &#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B 2  pin 2  ) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3v  was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is a very important fundamental transformation for conversion of C&#8208;F bond into C&#8208;H bond in organic synthesis. In the past decade, much progress has been achieved with HDF through the utility of low&#8208;valent metals, transition metal complexes and main&#8208;group Lewis acids. Recently, novel methods have been introduced for this purpose via photo&#8208; and electrochemical pathways, which would be of great significance, due to considerable environmental and economic advantages. This review highlights the HDF of fluorinated organic compounds (FOCs)  via  photo&#8208; and electrochemical strategies, along with the mechanistic insight.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Surface&#8208;Tethered Polymer Brush Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;tethered polymers are unique molecular architectures that have been recently used in advanced sensors, electronics, and biomedical applications. However, techniques for characterizing these materials in their surface&#8208;tethered form remain limited. The incorporation of luminescent functionality into these materials has enabled new characterization methods, while also unlocking new applications in optoelectronics, stenography and sensing. Micron&#8208;scale photolithography techniques have recently enabled the preparation of high&#8208;resolution patterns, as well as architectures with unique photophysical properties. Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface tethered polymers, as well as the short&#8208;term challenges and opportunities in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chromans through Bifunctional Enamine&#8208;Metal Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. A concise synthetic method for asymmetric synthesis of chromans from cyclohexanones and salicylaldehydes has been developed to afford tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers in good yields (up to 87%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 11:1:1 dr). This difficult organic transformation was achieved through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. It is believed that the strong activation of the salicylaldehydes through chelating to the metal Lewis acid and the bifunctional nature of the catalyst accounts for the high yields and enantioselectivity of the reaction. The absolute configurations of the chroman products were established through X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT Calculations were conducted to understand the mechanism and stereoselectivity of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Electrochemical Capacitors with Carbon Related Materials as Electrodes for AC Line Filtering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), are getting more essential for the rapid development of electronic devices. In order to satisfy the requirements of ECs with fast rate capability, appreciable capacitance density, numerous efforts have been made towards the preparation and design of electrode materials, which is a decisive factor in the performance of ECs. Carbon related electrode materials have been widely demonstrated to significantly increase the performance of ECs because of its light weight, high strength and high processability. In this concept, the latest advances in the rational design and controllable fabrication of carbon related electrode materials including planar two&#8208;dimensional materials, random three&#8208;dimensional materials, and vertical carbon materials are summarized. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress on carbon&#8208;based ECs have been discussed from the viewpoint of structure of electrode and performance of ECs. Finally, this concept present integrated perspectives on further design and preparation of carbon related ECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Deep&#8208;blue Luminescent Twisted Diphenylamino Terphenyl Emitters by Bromine&#8208;Lithium Exchange Borylation&#8208;Suzuki Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylationSuzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep&#8208;blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emissive Squaraine&#8208;AIEgen in Elastomer Enabling High Contrast and Fast Thermoresponse for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two challenges remain for organic thermoresponsive materials; one is to develop high performance red&#8208;emissive thermoresponsive materials, while another is to simultaneously achieve high contrast ratio (CR), fast and reversible thermoresponse in a single element. Herein, we not only develop a new deep&#8208;red emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen (TPE&#8208;SQ12) based on pyrylium end group, which is suitable for fabricating high performance thermoresponsive materials, but also show an effective approach to improve both CR (~ten times increase) and response time (less than 3 seconds), that is, molecularly dispersing AIEgen into an elastomer, attributed to the significantly expanded free volume of elastomer upon increasing the temperature that can activate the AIEgen intramolecular movements more pronouncedly. Double encryption and temperature mapping systems have been separately established using our designed elastomer/TPE&#8208;SQ12 film, showing the great potential for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing. Finally, white emission is further achieved by co&#8208;doping TPE&#8208;SQ12 with cyan dye into elastomer, which enables fluorescent thermochromism for improving the temperature mapping ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Bridged Triphenylamines Comprising Five&#8208; and Seven&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered rings is presented. The compounds are potent electron donors capable to undergo donor/acceptor interactions with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors both in the solid state and solution. These interactions were evaluated by IR and UV/vis spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. The vinylene&#8208;bridged compound was oxidized to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diketone which readily underwent acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with selected 1,2&#8208;phenylenediamines. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline derivatives represent valuable building blocks for the development of functional chromophores upon appropriate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: A Versatile Anticancer Tool with a Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow for precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of phospha&#8208;phenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to altered electronic distribution, may provide them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. Particularly, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show anti&#8208;proliferative properties in 14 cell lines including gliomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancer, reaching IC  50  values as low as 0.73 &#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with the photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;covalent Interactions in Molecular Systems: Thermodynamic Evaluation of the Hydrogen Bond Strength in Amino&#8208;ethers and Amino&#8208;alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra&#8208;HB) is one of the best known examples of non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bond in amino&#8208;alcohols and amino&#8208;ethers is one of the weakest. In contrast to the strong OH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N intramolecular hydrogen bond, the strength of the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O bond can hardly be measured with conventional spectroscopic methods, even for simple amino&#8208;alcohols, since the band belonging to the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O conformer merges with the free OH band. In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;ethanol and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O intra&#8208;HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined. In the second series, the influence of alkylation of the amino&#8208;group was investigated. In the third series, the effect of extending the alkyl chain between functional groups was studied.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dynamic deracemization processes, such as crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs), offer the opportunity to combine racemization and resolution processes, to provide high yields of enantiomerically pure compounds. To date, few of these processes have incorporated photochemical racemization. By combining batch crystallization with a flow photoreactor for efficient irradiation, it is possible to perform such deracemization in an effective, scalable and high yielding manner. After applying design of experiment (DoE) principles and mathematical modelling, the most efficient parameter set could be identified, leading to excellent results in just 4 hours reaction time: isolated yield of 82% and assay ee of 96%. Such photochemical racemization methods can serve to open new avenues for preparation of enantiomerically pure functional molecules on both small and industrially&#8208;relevant scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxy groups enhance [2]rotaxane anion binding selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of two [2]rotaxanes containing an interlocked three dimensional binding cavity formed from a pyridinium bis(amide) axle component containing two phenol donors, and an isophthalamide based macrocycle. In the competitive solvent mixture 1:1 CDCl  3  :CD  3  OD, one of the receptors exhibits a much higher selectivity preference for chloride than an analogous rotaxane without the hydroxy groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveal the chloride anion guest encapsulated within the interlocked binding cavity, though not all of the hydrogen bond donors are utilised. Computational semi&#8208;empirical simulations indicate that secondary intermolecular interactions occur between the axle hydroxy hydrogen bond donors and the [2]rotaxane macrocycle components, contributing to a more preorganised binding pocket, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cage&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction with Enhanced Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cage&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101)&#160; with&#160; biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid was synthesized&#160; via solvothermal method. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octanuclear nickel&#8208;clusters&#160; that are connected with each other by the 4&#8208;connected bptc  4&#8208;  &#160;ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed&#8208;metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of M  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101&#160;(M = Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The &#160;electrochemical &#160;studies&#160; showed that the&#160; hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)&#160;activity of&#160; Cu  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101 is much higher than that of other&#160;M  x  Ni  1&#8208;x  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101&#160;catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the&#160; bimetallic centers. The optimized &#160; Cu  0.19  Ni  0.81  &#8208;NKU&#8208;101  &#160;  has an overpotential&#160;of 324 mV at&#160;10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a Tafel slope of 131&#160;mV&#160;dec  &#8208;1  . The mechanism of HER activity over these&#160; bimetallic MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of convenient new methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly desirable. Herein, we report a practical method for dehydroxyazidation of alcohols via an S  N  2 pathway involving PPh  3  and trifunctional benziodazolone&#8208;based hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents, which function as an electrophilic center, an azido source, and a base. We successfully used this mild, chemoselective method for late&#8208;stage azidation of structurally complex alcohols, as well as for a new synthetic route to the antiepileptic drug rufinamide. We also investigated the reaction mechanism both experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Irreversible inhibition of IspG, a target for the development of new antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of its MEcPP substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighbouring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we showed that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition, which might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>An allyl uranium(IV) sandwich complex: are &#966; bonding interactions possible?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to explore head&#8208;to&#8208;head &#966; backbonding from uranium f&#8208;orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals was pursued. The coordination of anionic allyl groups to uranium was achieved via tethered anilide ligands, and the products were investigated using NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enylsilyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline ( LH ), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI  2  ( L1 )  2  ( 1 ), which was synthesized using the mono&#8208;deprotonated ligand [K][N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)silyl)2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L1 ). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U( L2 )  2  ( 2 ) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but most consistent results came from the use of the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]  2  [N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enidesilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] ( L2 ). This allyl&#8208;based sandwich complex was studied using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#966;) backbonding. The bonding between the U(IV) and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron donation from two&#8208;carbon&#8208;fragment localized electron density into empty f&#8208;orbitals.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A method to explore head-to-head &#966; backbonding from uranium f-orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals was pursued. The coordination of anionic allyl groups to uranium was achieved via tethered anilide ligands, and the products were investigated using NMR spectroscopy, single-crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N-((dimethyl)prop-2-enylsilyl)2,6-diisopropylaniline ( LH ), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI  2  ( L1 )  2  ( 1 ), which was synthesized using the mono-deprotonated ligand [K][N-((dimethyl)prop-2-enyl)silyl)2,6-diisopropylanilide] ( L1 ). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U( L2 )  2  ( 2 ) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but most consistent results came from the use of the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]  2  [N-((dimethyl)prop-2-enidesilyl)-2,6-diisopropylanilide] ( L2 ). This allyl-based sandwich complex was studied using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#966;) backbonding. The bonding between the U(IV) and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand-to-metal electron donation from two-carbon-fragment localized electron density into empty f-orbitals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles and activation volumes of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene dimerizations computed by the extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1 atm and high pressures up the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1 atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently&#8208;developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.</dc:description>

Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1 atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High-pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently-developed extreme pressure-polarizable continuum model (XP-PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]-ene reaction by the calculations.

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent receptor&#8208;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, that can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, that has been recently introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative  E  /  Z  photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the  Z  isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the  E  isomer to crosslinking binding of the  Z  isomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Cocrystal Formation Precedes the Mechanochemically Acetate&#8208;Assisted C&#8211;H Activation with [Cp*RhCl2]2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we studied experimentally the mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 in the presence of NaOAc. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8211;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl 2 ] 2 is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.</dc:description>
