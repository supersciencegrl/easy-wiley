         <title>Substituent Effects of Tetracoordinate Boron in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promotion by substituents: Tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates, such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, as electron&#8208;donating groups. This review mainly focuses on reactions promoted by such substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The present review focuses on recent examples of tetracoordinate boryl groups greatly influencing reactions in organic synthesis. Electron&#8208;rich tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, and interaction of the intermediates with carbon&#8208;boron or heteroatom&#8208;boron bonds is the origin of such substituent effects. Unique substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups often promote desired reactions and affect results of reactions such as yield and selectivity of products.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Switches and Motors: Recent Developments and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review discusses the recent developments in the synthesis and applications of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology, etc. The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.

         <title>211At and 125I&#8208;Labeling of (Hetero)Aryliodonium Ylides: Astatine Wins Again</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophilic 211At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides was investigated and proved significantly more efficient than radioiodination. Reaction is rapid at room temperature with electron&#8208;poor activated substrates whereas heating and addition of the radical scavenger TEMPO was essential in the case of deactivated precursors to reach high RCY and molar activity.







Abstract
Despite the growing interest in radioiodine and 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the search for radiolabeling reactions has been somewhat neglected, resulting in a limited number of available radiosynthetic strategies. Herein we report a comparative study of nucleophilic 125I and 211At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides. Whereas radioiodination efficiency was low, 211At&#8208;labeling performed efficiently on a broad scope of precursors. The most activated aryliodonium ylides led rapidly to quantitative reactions at room temperature in acetonitrile. For deactivated precursors, heating up to 90&#8201;&#176;C in glyme and addition of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) as radical scavenger appeared essential to avoid precursor degradation and to achieve high radiochemical yields and molar activity. The approach was applied successfully to the preparation of 4&#8208;[211At]astatophenylalanine (4&#8208;APA), an amino acid derivative increasingly studied as radiotherapeutic drug for cancers. This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic 211At&#8208;labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building bridges: We have developed an unprecedented asymmetric decarbonylative aryl addition of an aromatic aldehyde to bicyclic alkenes, catalyzed by chiral cationic iridium. This process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched bridged bicyclic systems from aromatic aldehydes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee).







Abstract
We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enabled the formation of asymmetric C&#8722;C bonds through the formation of an aryl&#8722;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without a stoichiometric aryl&#8722;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8722;Me&#8722;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.

         <title>Hydrazone Photoswitches for Structural Modulation of Short Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of new photoswitches that can modulate biomolecules has been of consistent interest. Herein, it is shown that installation of amide substituents at different position(s) of hydrazone photoswitches does not cause a significant change in E/Z photoswitching behaviors. It is also demonstrated that a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring is effective for structural control of short peptides.







Abstract
Molecules that undergo light&#8208;driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein, we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecules that undergo light-driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein, we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade C&#8722;H Functionalization/Asymmetric Allylation Reaction of Aryl &#945;&#8208;Diazoamides and Allenes: Lewis Acid Makes a Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral Lewis acid enables chiral palladium complex&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/asymmetric allylation reaction of aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoamides and allenes to give synthetically useful chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives in enhanced yield and enantioselectivity (up to 93&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/asymmetric allylation reaction with aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoamides and allenes has been developed. The reaction provides an efficient approach to construct chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives in high levels of yield and enantioselectivity (up to 93&#8201;% ee). Notably, the chromium complex works as Lewis acid to facilitate the formation of palladium carbene and to enhance acidity of carboxylic acid, allowing for higher stereochemical control and efficiency.

         <title>Continuous Flow Bioconjugations of NIR&#8208;AZA Fluorophores via Strained Alkyne Cycloadditions with Intra&#8208;Chip Fluorogenic Monitoring**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous in&#8208;flow fluorogenic bioconjugations are achievable in five minutes under mild conditions with real&#8208;time intra&#8208;chip reaction progress monitoring. The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
The importance of bioconjugation reactions continues to grow for cell specific targeting and dual therapeutic plus diagnostic medical applications. This necessitates the development of new bioconjugation chemistries, in&#8208;flow synthetic and analytical methods. With this goal, continuous flow bioconjugations were readily achieved with short residence times for strained alkyne substituted carbohydrate and therapeutic peptide biomolecules in reaction with azide and tetrazine substituted fluorophores. The strained alkyne substrates included substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose, and the linear and cyclic peptide sequences QIRQQPRDPPTETLELEVSPDPAS&#8208;OH and c(RGDfK) respectively. The catalyst and reagent&#8208;free inverse electron demand tetrazine cycloadditions proved more favourable than the azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. Reaction completion was achieved with residence times of 5&#8197;min at 40&#8201;&#176;C for tetrazine versus 10&#8197;min at 80&#8201;&#176;C for azide cycloadditions. The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time. The application of continuous flow fluorogenic bioconjugations could offer an efficient translational access to theranostic agents.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Products by C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis is considered by many as the finest combination of art and science. During the last decades, several concepts were proposed for achieving the perfect vision of total synthesis, such as atom economy, step economy, or redox economy. In this context, C&#8211;H functionalization represents the most powerful platform that has emerged in the last years, empowering rapid synthesis of complex natural products and enabling diversification of bioactive scaffolds based on natural product architectures. In this review, we present an overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8211;H functionalization. Heterocycles represent the most common motifs in drug discovery and marketed drugs. The implementation of C&#8211;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, but also changes the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permits access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reaction of Aldehydes to C&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and Csubstituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8208;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Recent studies have demonstrated nickel catalysis is highly effective in these reactions, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available using other metal catalysts. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents.







Abstract
The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8211;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Although rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts have been commonly used for these reactions, more recent work has demonstrated nickel catalysis is also highly effective, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described.

         <title>Assessing Alkali&#8208;Metal Effects in the Structures and Reactivity of Mixed&#8208;Ligand Alkyl/Alkoxide Alkali&#8208;Metal Magnesiates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of several new mixed alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates have allowed for assessing their stability in solution and their reactivity towards Mg&#8722;Br exchange using 2&#8208;bromoanisole as a model substrate. Revealing a pronounced alkali&#8208;metal effect, potassium magnesiates are more powerful exchange reagents although the constitution of the final products in these reactions is strongly dependent on the nature of the alkoxide employed.







Abstract
Advancing the understanding of using alkali&#8208;metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed&#8208;ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates [MMg(CH2SiMe3)2(dmem)]2 [dmem=2&#8208;{[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M=Li, 1; Na, 2; (THF)K, 3] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali&#8208;metal effect with potassium magnesiate 3 being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr2(dmem)]2 (Ar=o&#8208;OMe&#8722;C6H4) intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]n and [MgAr(dmem)]2 (5). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;=2&#8208;ethylhexyl) which undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Mg(CH2SiMe3) to give [KMg(CH2SiMe3)2(OR&#8217;)]2 (7). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2&#8208;bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr2(OR&#8217;)]2 (9) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali&#8208;metal mediated Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.

         <title>Combined in Silico and in Vitro Approaches To Uncover the Oxidation and Schiff Base Reaction of Baicalein as an Inhibitor of Amyloid Protein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of baicalein and subsequent Schiff base reaction with pentylamine (lysine side&#8208;chain model) have been assessed by computational and experimental approaches. The reaction proceeds through initial ion pair formation followed by a redox chain reaction. The atomistic mechanistic findings (transient intermediates) can be used in drug design campaigns against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
The oxidized form of baicalein (BA) leads to covalent binding with human amyloid proteins. Such adducts hamper the aggregation and deposition of fibrils. A novel reaction of BA with pentylamine (PA) as a model for the lysine side chain is described. This is the first study addressing the atomistic details of a Schiff base reaction with the trihydroxylated moiety of BA. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry approaches clearly indicate the formation of dehydrobaicalein in solution as well as its condensation with PA under aerobic conditions, yielding regioselectively C6&#8208;substituted products. The combined results suggest initial ion pair formation between BA and PA, followed by a redox chain reaction: the initiation by oxygen/air; an o&#8208;quinone&#8208;based chain involving oxidation and reduction steps; and extra off&#8208;chain formation of a doubly oxidized product. These mechanistic details support the anti&#8208;amyloid activity of BA and endorse its trihydroxyphenyl moiety as a pharmacophore for drug&#8208;design studies.

         <title>Weak Antiferromagnetic Exchange and Ferromagnetic Alignment of FeII (S=2) Spins in Differently Charged {HAT&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}n (n=2&#8208; and 3&#8208;) Assemblies of Hexaazatriphenylenes (HAT)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;hexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} ligands form coordination complexes with high&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in dianion and radical&#8208;trianion states. This provides weak antiferromagnetic exchange or ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins within the coordination assemblies.







Abstract
Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} are reduced by metallic iron in the presence of crystal violet (CV+)(Cl&#8722;). Anionic ligands are produced, which simultaneously coordinate three FeIICl2 to form (CV+)2{HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (1) and (CV+)3{HAT(CN)6. (FeIICl2)3}3&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5CVCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.5&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (2). High&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#8197;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII in {HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722; (1) with a Weiss temperature (&#920;) of &#8722;80&#8197;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (J) is &#8722;4.7&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The {HAT(CN)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8722; assembly is obtained in 2. The formation of HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with g=2.0037. The magnetic behavior of 2 is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII and HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; spins with J1=&#8722;164&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2&#8197;J formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII spins with J2=&#8722;15.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three FeIICl2 units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the &#967;MT values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#8197;K up to 15.06&#8197;emu&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K/mol at 6&#8197;K, and the Weiss temperature is also positive being at +23&#8197;K. Thus, a change in the charge and spin state of the HAT&#8208;type ligand to &#8901;3&#8722; results in ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins, yielding a high&#8208;spin (S=11/2) system. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)6, their complexes with FeIICl2 have a variety of closely lying excited high&#8208;spin states with multiplicity up to S=15/2.

An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; in {HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with a Weiss temperature (&lt;i&gt;&#920;&lt;/i&gt;) of &#8722;80&#8197;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;) is &#8722;4.7&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The {HAT(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; assembly is obtained in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. The formation of HAT(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with &lt;i&gt;g=&lt;/i&gt;2.0037. The magnetic behavior of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and HAT(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; spins with &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;164&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8722;2&#8197;&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt; formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; spins with &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;15.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the &lt;i&gt;&#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#8197;K up to 15.06&#8197;emu&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K/mol at 6&#8197;K, and the Weiss temperature is also positive being at +23&#8197;K. Thus, a change in the charge and spin state of the HAT-type ligand to &#8901;3&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; results in ferromagnetic alignment of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; spins, yielding a high-spin (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=11/2) system. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, their complexes with Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have a variety of closely lying excited high-spin states with multiplicity up to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=15/2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiation and Zincation Reactions of Aromatics and Heterocycles Triggered by Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>

Switch at Will: The functionalization of aromatics and heterocycles by using Zn&#8208; or Mg&#8208;TMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) bases has been widely explored. In many cases, a full switch of regioselectivity can be achieved in the presence of a Lewis acid additive. Also, these methods are compatible with continuous flow setups allowing the use of highly reactive lithium bases under practical reaction conditions.







Abstract
Mixed TMP&#8208;bases (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl), such as TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl, TMP2Mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, TMPZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, are outstanding reagents for the metalation of functionalized aromatics and heterocycles. In the presence of Lewis acids, such as BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 or MgCl2, the metalation scope of such bases was dramatically increased, and regioselectivity switches were achieved in the presence or absence of these Lewis acids. Furthermore, highly reactive lithium bases, such as TMPLi or Cy2NLi, are also compatible with various Lewis acids, such as MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, ZnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or CuCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Performing such metalations in continuous flow using commercial setups permitted practical and convenient reaction conditions.

         <title>Ring Opening Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactam in Superacidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>

Opening up possibilities: The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 and SO2/HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) leads exclusively to previously unknown open&#8208;chain compounds. With HF as the solvent, salts of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride and diprotonated &#946;&#8208;alanine are obtained, depending on the reaction conditions. Interestingly, the change of the solvent to SO2 leads to the formation of a salt containing a thionylimide moiety.







Abstract
The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]. In the presence of traces of water, the diprotonated species &#946;&#8208;alanine [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2 was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low&#8208;temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted in the case of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2. By using SO2 instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)2(CH2)2NHSO][SbF6]2 was obtained, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from N&#8208;protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam.

         <title>Linked Rotaxane Structure Restricts Local Molecular Motions in Solution to Enhance Fluorescence Properties of Tetraphenylethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to enhance the performance of fluorophores, with regards to properties such as fluorescence quantum yield and photostability, is reported in this work, using the fluorescent dye tetraphenylethylene. A linked rotaxane structure effectively prevents the local molecular motions of the fluorophore, leading to the enhancement of the performance.







Abstract
The restriction of local molecular motions is critical for improving the fluorescence quantum yields (FQYs) and the photostability of fluorescent dyes. Herein, we report a supramolecular approach to enhance the performance of fluorescent dyes by incorporating a linked rotaxane structure with permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives generally exhibit low FQYs in solution due to the molecular motions in the excited state. We show that TPE with linked rotaxane structures on two sides displays up to 15&#8208;fold higher FQYs. Detailed investigations with variable temperature 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the linked rotaxane structure rigidifies the TPE moiety and thus suppresses the local molecular motions and non&#8208;radiative decay. Moreover, the linked rotaxane structure enhances the FQY of the dye in various solvents, including aqueous solutions, and improves the photostability through the inhibition of local molecular motions in the excited TPE.

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Cu nanosheets array support structure was provided as the substrate of organic photocathode, which provides more reactive sites and increases the effective light absorption area. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu NSA increases the distribution range of the built&#8208;in electric field, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the photocatalytic performance. The proposal of the simple support structure provides a direction for the design and implementation of spatially separated PEC cell.







Abstract
The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carrier separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced a copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50&#8197;mV to 0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and co&#8208;catalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14&#8201;% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathodes.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Mesoporous Carbons from Cyclodextrin Nanosponges Enabling High&#8208;Capacity Silicon Anodes and Sulfur Cathodes for Lithiated Si&#8208;S Batteries</title>

A facile production strategy to synthesize Si and S directly within porous carbon derived from cyclodextrin nanosponges. These materials act as high capacity electrodes in Lithiated Si&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. Their typical structure of truncated cone can host a wide variety of guest molecules to create inclusion complexes; indeed, we daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high&#8208;capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and guarantees stable cycling performance. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. We show that the use of commercial LP30 electrolyte causes a larger capacity fade, and this is associated with different solid electrolyte interface layer formation and it is also demonstrated that fluoroethylene carbonate addition can significantly increase the capacity retention and the overall performance of our nanostructured Si/C composite in both ether&#8208;based and LP30 electrolytes. As a result, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8722;S cell.

         <title>An Alkynyl&#8208;Dangling Ru(II) Polypyridine Complex for Targeted Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>

An alkynyl&#8208;dangling ruthenium(II) polypyridine complex Ru2, which may rapidly conjugate to the amino groups on the unique membrane lipids of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through the bio&#8208;orthogonal amino&#8208;yne click reaction has been investigated. Such a selective labeling process in combination with its good singlet oxygen quantum yield makes Ru2 to be able to photo&#8208;inactivate bacterial such as S. aureus and MRSA efficiently and specifically, but leaving mammalian cells undamaged under the same conditions.







Abstract
To realize clinical application of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), one of the most arduous challenges is how to render aPDT agents high selectivity against bacterial pathogens. In light of the fact that amino group&#8208;containing lipids are rich on the outer surfaces of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, we herein constructed an alkynyl&#8208;dangling ruthenium(II) polypyridine complex (Ru2) to preferentially label Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) over mammalian cells via the amino&#8208;yne bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Thanks to the strong singlet oxygen generation ability, Ru2 could photo&#8208;inactivate S. aureus and MRSA effectively and specifically. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules also exist in mammalian cells but are not accessible for Ru2, leading to its poor binding/uptake and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark and upon irradiation towards mammalian cells as well as low hemolysis, all favorable for aPDT application.

Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and substituent conformational switching &#8211; mediated hysteretic spin&#8208;state switching is reported for two mononuclear iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes. Stable hysteretic switching of &#916;T1/2=62&#8197;K and &#916;T=288&#8197;K is observed for one of the complexes: Fe[(bpp&#8722;COOEt)2](ClO4)2&#8901;CH3NO2. This complex is unprecedented for the iron(II)&#8722;bpp family and encourages the pursuit of iron(II)&#8208;based SCO complexes for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications.







Abstract
Bistable spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;T1/2) spin&#8208;state switching are desirable for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications. In this study, we report on structural facets governing hysteretic SCO in a set of iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes &#8211; [Fe(bpp&#8722;COOEt)2](X)2&#8901;CH3NO2 (X=ClO4, 1; X=BF4, 2). Stable spin&#8208;state switching &#8211; T1/2=288&#8197;K; &#916;T1/2=62&#8197;K &#8211; is observed for 1, whereas 2 undergoes above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature lattice&#8208;solvent content&#8208;dependent SCO &#8211; T1/2=331&#8197;K; &#916;T1/2=43&#8197;K. Variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations &#8211; from the Jahn&#8208;Teller&#8208;distorted HS state to the less distorted LS state &#8211; and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in 1 and 2. Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule&#8208;based switching and memory elements.

Variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations &#8211; from the Jahn-Teller-distorted HS state to the less distorted LS state &#8211; and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule-based switching and memory elements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three equivalents of heteroallene can be captured between the Si&#8722;P bonds of Zintl&#8208;derived clusters. Silyl coordination at either the nitrogen or chalcogen of the heteroallene can be controlled by tuning the groups on the silyl moiety or functional groups at the heteroallene. It was also found that one captured small molecule can be exchanged for another, evidencing small molecule catch and release at these clusters.







Abstract
Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P7(SiR3)3) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.

         <title>New Palladium &#8211; ZrO2 Nano&#8208;Architectures from Thermal Transformation of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for Carbonylative Suzuki and Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>

New Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 nanocomposites, obtained by direct pyrolysis of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under nitrogen or air, presented high ability to form benzophenone according to carbonylative Suzuki pathway under 1&#8197;atm of CO with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1. Pd/ZrO2 nanocomposites are superior catalysts of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Its morphology was preserved during the catalytic reaction.







Abstract
The new nanocomposites, Pd/C/ZrO2, PdO/ZrO2, and Pd/PdO/ZrO2, were prepared by thermal conversion of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2 (MOF) in nitrogen or air atmosphere. The presence of Pd nanoparticles, uniformly distributed on the ZrO2 or C/ZrO2 matrix, was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman and X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) methods. All pyrolysed composites retained the shape of the MOF template. They catalyze carbonylative Suzuki coupling under 1&#8197;atm CO with an efficiency significantly higher than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2. The most active PdO/ZrO2 composite, formed benzophenone with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1, while by using Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2, much lower TOF values, 51&#8211;95&#8197;h&#8722;1, were achieved. After the reaction, PdO/ZrO2 was recovered with the same composition and catalytic activity. Very good results were also obtained in the transfer hydrogenation of benzophenones to alcohols with Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation.

         <title>Spiroconjugated Tetraaminospirenes as Donors in Color&#8208;Tunable Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure</title>

Emitters go spiro: Using spiroconjugated tetraamines as a novel type of donor and a range of different acceptors in three different modes of connection, 12 donor&#8208;acceptor compounds are synthesized. Their twisted structures lead to a spatial separation of the HOMOs and LUMOs. Photophysical measurements show tunable emission colors for these donor&#8208;acceptor compounds, and photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 99&#8201;% in solution are obtained.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer emitters are attractive due to their color tunability and potentially high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). We herein present tetraaminospirenes as donor moieties, which, in combination with a variety of acceptors, furnished 12 charge&#8208;transfer emitters with a range of emission colors and PLQYs of up to 99&#8201;%. The spatial separation of their frontier molecular orbitals was obtained through careful structural design, and two DA structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A range of photophysical measurements supported by DFT calculations shed light on the optoelectronic properties of this new family of spiro&#8208;NN&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor dyes.

         <title>Bulk Mn2+ Doped 1D Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskite with Highly Efficient, Tunable and Stable Broadband Light Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of 1D perovskite: Through controllable Mn2+ doping strategy toward bulk 1D perovskite, enhanced energy transfer from bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions gives rise to tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest PLQY up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
Mn2+ doped colloidal three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) has attracted intensive research attention; however, the low exciton binding energy and fatal optical instability of 3D PNC seriously hinder the optoelectronic application. Therefore, it remains significant to explore new stable host perovskite with strongly bound exciton to realize more desirable luminescent property. In this work, we utilized bulk one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid perovskite of [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (AEP=N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine) as structural platform to rationally optimize the luminescent property by a controllable Mn2+ doping strategy. Significantly, the series of Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O show enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the strongly bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions, resulting in tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest photoluminescence quantum yield up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskite as excellent down&#8208;converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high&#8208;performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid&#8208;state lighting and displaying devices.

More importantly, these Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped 1D perovskite as excellent down-converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low-dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high-performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid-state lighting and displaying devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Insights into the Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Features of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>

Evolution and other transformations: The binding of ACE2 triggers an obvious conformational transformation of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 spike protein. Compared with SARS&#8208;COV, several aspects of the spike protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 have evolved, including its binding affinity with ACE2 as well as the structural features of cleavage sites.







Abstract
COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of the S protein. Binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes in Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2&#8242; were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides a theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.

         <title>Assessing the Importance of Cation Size in the Tetragonal&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition in Lithium&#8208;Garnet Electrolytes**
</title>

The high temperature tetragonal&#8208;cubic phase in lithium garnet electrolytes (A3B2Li7O12) is not fully understood. Herein, the transition temperature dependence based on site substitution is investigated, surprisingly it was found a direct relationship to cell volume is perhaps too simplistic. We show that the B site plays an important role, whereas A site substitution (which alters the cell volume noticeably) has minimal difference. The octahedral site ionic radius required to stabilise a room temperature A3B2Li7O12 cubic phase is then suggested.







Abstract
Lithium garnets are promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of seven lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g., La3Zr2Li7O12), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8211;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub&#8208;lattice.
The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.
Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed by variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.

RutheniumII complexes bearing axially chiral bipyridyls were synthesized, and matched (more relaxed) &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and mismatched (more constrained) &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer was nonluminescent. In contrast, the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited vivid red circularly polarized phosphorescence. For the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the cumulative CH/&#960; interactions seem to suppress further distortion in the T1 state.







Abstract
RutheniumII complexes bearing three axially chiral bipyridyl ligands were synthesized as a new family of chiral complex dyes, and &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggested that all the bipyridyls maintained chirality in both the ground and excited states, and the &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomers are the matched (more relaxed) and mismatched (more constrained) pairs, respectively. The mismatched &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited red circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) both in solution and in the solid state. The solution state CPP is the most intense of ruthenium complexes, while the solid state CPP is the first example of them. It is supposed that, for the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the six cumulative CH/&#960; interactions suppress further distortion in the T1 state.

         <title>Z&#8208;Scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 Heterojunction for Boosting Photo&#8208;Oxidation of Sulfide into Sulfoxide under Ambient Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000&#8201;heterojunction photocatalysts was constructed via a solvothermal method, which efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In2S3 show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In2S3/NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (.O2&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full-spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000 to afford nontoxic 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU-1000 and In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NU-1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron-hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z-scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacially Super&#8208;Assembled Benzimidazole Derivative&#8208;Based Mesoporous Silica Nanoprobe for Sensitive Copper (II) Detection and Biosensing in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique mesoporous silica nanoprobe (DHBM&#8208;MSN) based on benzimidazole derivative is constructed for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. The designed DHBM&#8208;MSN has obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solution with extremely low detection limit. The detection system is successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice and live cells. The results indicate that DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with benzimidazole&#8208;derived fluorescent molecules (DHBM) are fabricated via a feasible interfacial superassembly strategy for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. DHBM&#8208;MSN exhibits an obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solutions, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;M. The DHBM&#8208;MSN solid&#8208;state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that nanocarriers with different morphologies do not affect the specific detectionability. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental results and density function theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. These results indicate that the DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.

         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photodynamics of the methylated isomer, N1&#8208;methylpseudouridine (m1&#968;), which is commonly used in mRNA therapeutics were investigated alongside the canonical base uridine; m1&#968; was found to have a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield than uridine. However, following UVC irradiation m1&#968; is shown to be ca. 6.7&#8197;times more photostable than uridine.







Abstract
N1&#8208;Methylation of pseudouridine (m1&#968;) replaces uridine (Urd) in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m1&#968; is compared to that of uridine by using photoirradiation at 267&#8197;nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m1&#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both molecules decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m1&#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than Urd following irradiation at 267&#8197;nm.

         <title>Electrodeposition of Defect&#8208;Rich Ternary NiCoFe Layered Double Hydroxides: Fine Modulation of Co3+ for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective but efficient: The binder&#8208;free Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF, with a unique nanoarray structural feature, was fabricated as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF showed the optimized electronic structure and exposed more defects than Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;mono prepared by traditional coprecipitation method. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF demonstrated excellent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 209&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;abundance and durable layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the easy agglomeration of lamellar LDHs in the aqueous phase limits their practical applications. Herein, a series of ternary NiCoFe LDHs were successfully fabricated on nickel foam (NF) via a simple electrodeposition method. The as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF displayed an unique nanoarray structural feature. It showed an OER overpotential of 209&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline solution, which was superior to most systems reported so far. As evidenced by the XPS and XAFS results, such excellent performance of Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF was attributed to the higher Co3+/Co2+ ratio and more defects exposed, comparing with Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)&#8208;mono LDHs prepared by conventional coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the ratio of Co to Fe could significantly tune the Co electronic structure of Ni(CoxFe1&#8208;x)/NF composites (x=0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) and affect the electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF showed the lowest energy barrier for OER rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*). This work proposes a facile method to develop high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR&#8208;Driven Crystal Structure Prediction of Molecular Crystals: The Case of Mebendazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make it faster! A combined Crystal Structure Prediction &#8211; NMR crystallography (CSP&#8197;NMRX) approach is presented for solving the structures of the three polymorphs, A, B, and C, of mebendazole. These are characterized by three different tautomeric forms, that is, they are desmotropes.

Among all possible NMR crystallography approaches for crystal&#8208;structure determination, crystal structure prediction &#8211; NMR crystallography (CSP&#8208;NMRX) has recently turned out to be a powerful method. In the latter, the original procedure exploited solid&#8208;state NMR (SSNMR) information during the final steps of the prediction. In particular, it used the comparison of computed and experimental chemical shifts for the selection of the correct crystal packing. Still, the prediction procedure, generally carried out with DFT methods, may require important computational resources and be quite time&#8208;consuming, especially if there are no available constraints to use at the initial stage. Herein, the successful application of this combined prediction method, which exploits NMR information also in the input step to reduce the search space of the predictive algorithm, is presented. Herein, this method was applied on mebendazole, which is characterized by desmotropism. The use of SSNMR data as constraints for the selection of the right tautomer and the determination of the number of independent molecules in the unit cell led to a considerably faster process, reducing the number of calculations to be performed. In this way, the crystal packing was successfully predicted for the three known phases of mebendazole. To evaluate the quality of the predicted structures, these were compared to the experimental ones. The crystal structure of phase&#8197;B of mebendazole, in particular, was determined de novo by powder diffraction and is presented for the first time in this paper.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make it faster&lt;/b&gt;! A combined Crystal Structure Prediction &#8211; NMR crystallography (CSP&#8197;NMRX) approach is presented for solving the structures of the three polymorphs, A, B, and C, of mebendazole. These are characterized by three different tautomeric forms, that is, they are desmotropes. The predicted structures show perfect overlapping with the experimental ones, with that of form B solved de novo from powder X-ray diffraction.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>

Au&#8722;S bonding&#8208;amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for Thioglycolic acid (TGA) detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface was reported.







Abstract
Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8722;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03&#8197;&#956;M to 300&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013&#8197;&#956;M (3&#963;/m). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.

         <title>Calixarenes Incorporating Sulfonamide Moieties: Versatile Ligands for Carbonic Anhydrases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calixarene derivatives bearing arms terminating with primary benzensulfonamides demonstrated their ability of inhibiting human Carbonic Anhydrases with significant efficiency and selectivity among different isoforms of the enzymes. A mode of binding where the benzensulfonamide arm penetrates into the funnel of the enzyme active site and interacts with the protein Zn2+ ion is supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction data and MD calculations.







Abstract
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms, and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and molecular modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.

Through an original superelectrophile&#8208;promoted difluoroethylation in superacid, CF2&#8208;Me aromatic amines can be synthesized directly and regioselectivity. Applied to simple substrates, natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients, this method offers an alternative for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of aryl methyl ethers bioisosters.







Abstract
Under superacid conditions, aromatic amines are directly and regioselectively 1,1&#8208;difluoroethylated. Low temperature in situ NMR studies confirmed the presence of benzylic &#945;&#8208;fluoronium and &#945;&#8208;chloronium ions as key intermediates in the reaction. This method has a wide substrate scope and can be applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Utilisation of CO2 as &#8220;Structure Modifier&#8221; of Inorganic Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is abundant and free but environmentally unfriendly. It is also unreactive, hence re&#8208;purposing can be a challenge. This research article describes how CO2 can be used as a useful reagent towards the preparation and/or chemical and structural modification of inorganic solids. This approach is of wide application hence, in the future, it may become part of a toolbox of methods to reduce the environmental impact of CO2.







Abstract
Utilisation of CO2 as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule's inherent chemical stability. However, CO2 reacts promptly at high temperature (&#8764;1000&#8201;&#176;C) with alkaline&#8208;earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re&#8208;utilisation. In this work, this concept is extended and CO2 is utilised as a reagent to modify the crystal structure of mixed&#8208;metal inorganic solids. Modification of the crystal structure is a &#8220;tool&#8221; used by materials scientists to tailor the physical property of solids. CO2 gas was reacted with several isostructural mixed&#8208;metal oxides Sr2CuO3, Sr1.8Ba0.2CuO3 and Ba2PdO3. These oxides are carefully selected to show anion vacancies in their crystal structure, to act as host sites for CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of carbonate anions, (CO3)2&#8722;. The corresponding oxide carbonates were formed successfully and the favourable formation of SrCO3 as secondary phase was minimised via an innovative, yet simple synthetic procedure involving alternating of CO2 and air. We also derived a simple model to predict the kinetics of the reactions for the cuprates, using first&#8208;principles density functional theory and assimilating the reaction to a gas&#8208;surface process.

We also derived a simple model to predict the kinetics of the reactions for the cuprates, using first-principles density functional theory and assimilating the reaction to a gas-surface process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

These cations were prepared in superacidic media starting from &#946;&#8208;propiolactam under the reaction conditions described on their labels. In the lower part of the picture is a Petri dish containing a mold culture representing penicillinium, which carries the &#946;&#8208;propiolactam motif as an important component. The magnifying glass highlights the ring structure, and the scissors show where cleavage occurs in superacids. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J.

         <title>Front Cover: Computational Insights into the Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Features of the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein (Chem. Eur. J. 6/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the prefusion conformation of the spike protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 can be stabilized alone, a spontaneously and energy&#8208;friendly centripetal movement of the receptor binding domain occurs when spike protein binds to ACE2. During the binding process, several residues, especially Phe329 and Phe515, play a significant role in the allosteric effect. As a result, two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2&#8242; are exposed on the surface. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Zhang, J. Fu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104215).

Bistable spin&#8208;state switching near room temperature: Two mononuclear iron(II) complexes showing technologically relevant abrupt and wide hysteretic, bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics in the vicinity of room temperature are reported. The large structural reorganizations from the Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;distorted high&#8208;spin state to the less distorted low&#8208;spin state and ethyl group conformational switching are proposed as the main contributing factors rendering the switching hysteretic.

         <title>The Appeal of Small Molecules for Practical Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor substitution in small molecules with a compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated system leads to record&#8208;high molecular nonlinearities in small sizes. A dense monolithic assembly of such molecules can have extraordinarily strong nonlinear optical properties. The ability to vapor deposit such small molecule materials makes them highly competitive for adding all&#8208;optical switching and/or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics.







Abstract
Small organic molecules with a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system that consists of only a few double or triple bonds can have significantly smaller optical excitation energies when equipped with donor and acceptor groups, which raises the quantum limits to the molecular polarizabilities. As a consequence, third&#8208;order nonlinear optical polarizabilities become orders of magnitude larger than those of molecules of similar size without donor&#8208;acceptor substitution. This enables strong third&#8208;order nonlinear optical effects (as high as 1000 times those of silica glass) in dense, amorphous monolithic assemblies. These properties, accompanied by the possibility of deposition from the vapor phase and of electric&#8208;field poling at higher temperatures, make the resulting materials competitive towards adding an active nonlinear optical or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics platforms.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Perfluoroalkylation of Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 6, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient process for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides is reported in this work. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.







Abstract
An efficient and broadly applicable process is reported for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes including benzofurans, benzothiophenes, (aza)indoles, furans and pyrroles. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the efficiency and robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.

         <title>Metal Complexes of singly, doubly and triply linked Porphyrins and Corroles: An Insight into the Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes of multi&#8208;porphyrins and multi&#8208;corroles are unique systems that display a host of extremely interesting properties. Availability of free  meso  and b positions allow formation of different types of directly linked bis&#8208;porphyrins giving rise to intriguing optical and electronic properties. While the fields of metalloporphyrin and corroles monomer have seen exponential growth in the last decades, the chemistry of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and bis&#8208;corroles remain rather underexplored. Therefore, the impact of covalent linkages on the optical, electronic, (spectro)electrochemical, magnetic and electrocatalytic activities of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and &#8208;corroles has been summarized in this review article. This article shows that despite the (still) somewhat difficult synthetic access to these molecules, their extremely exciting properties do make a strong case for pursuing research on these classes of compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Driven Systematic Synthesis of Coordination Polymers with Noncentrosymmetric Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is an important concept in chemistry revealing intriguing optical properties such as circular dichroism (CD), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), etc. As one of the noncentrosymmmetric (NCS) classes, chiral materials with extended structures may exhibit unique nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, i.e., second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). In this Concept article, a series of recently discovered NCS coordination polymers (CPs) by using carefully designed chiral organic ligands are reviewed. Combining several metal cations such as lanthanides, lead, zinc, and cadmium with rigid chiral ligands have resulted in interesting CPs with both polar and nonpolar structures. Detailed structures, SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships are provided. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa and Delta variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed&#160;  K  d  &#160;values ranging from 2 &#8208; 10 nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized&#160; pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with&#160;  K  d  &#160;values between 20 &#8208; 50 pM , and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. &#160;This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8722;H and P&#8722;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental/theoretical study of Ni pincer complexes with a bridgehead pyrimidine&#8208;based NHC and arylphosphino side arms revealed unique features about stepwise C&#8722;H activation, ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of an isolated complex followed by ethyl migration with C&#8722;CNHC coupling, and an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation affording through PPh2 migration a NiII complex with a terminal phosphanido ligand and a new C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand.







Abstract
Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms was examined. The unique features observed include: 1) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8722;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene; 2) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6 (9) upon halide abstraction; 3) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8722;C&#8722;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6 (10); and 4) an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation transforming the P&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand of 8 in a C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15). The data are supported by nine crystal structure determinations and theoretical calculations provided insights into the mechanisms of these transformations, which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic steps of general interest.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Unusual Stabilization of cis&#8208;Isomers by a Spherical Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to a polyaromatic capsule, an azobenzene derivative is quantitatively encapsulated by the spherical cavity with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity. The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization is suppressed against heat and light due to the confined cavity effect. C,N&#8208;diphenyl imines are also encapsulated by the capsule and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The cavity suppresses their hydrolysis in water due to the shielding effect.







Abstract
To explore new cavity functions, we herein employed cis&#8208;trans stereoisomers with a N=N, C=C, or C=N unit as guest indicators for a polyaromatic capsule. Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of &#8764;1&#8197;nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the cis&#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore, C,N&#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the cis&#8208;trans isomers could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.

         <title>Rearrangements in Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review portrays rearrangements with substrates of various genres in Scholl reaction. The rearranged products formed due to automerization, migration of substituents, rearrangement accompanied by cyclization, ring expansion, and ring contraction under Scholl&#8208;type reactions are gathered. In cases where new ring is constructed, they are grouped based on ring size. The crucial factors that drive rearrangements via enigmatic intermediates and the methods for successful prevention of rearrangements are also discussed.







Abstract
Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.

Abstract
Temperature monitoring in&#8197;vivo plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes in&#8197;vivo allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for in&#8197;vivo temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body. The perspectives of these lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite thermometers for the optimization of temperature monitoring performance and potential future development are also discussed.

         <title>Properties of the Reactants and Their Interactions within and with the Enzyme Binding Cavity Determine Reaction Selectivities. The Case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases catalyse with high specificity a variety of oxidative transformations of their substrates. This review provides a survey of computational and experimental studies revealing structural and electronic factors responsible for a broad scope of chemistry performed by this class of enzymes. These factors encompass inherent properties of ferryl species and organic substrates, steric hindrance imposed by the enzyme, specific enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions and substrate's conformational freedom within the binding cavity.







Abstract
Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, that is hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, that is, substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme's binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.

         <title>Developing the Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation Mechanism of Cyclopentane: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homemade MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS is used to observe the low&#8208;temperature oxidation products of cyclopentane, including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP), at a total pressure of 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and a low temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. The low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT was studied by experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by comparison with acyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and acycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy are not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. Low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (e.&#8201;g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of the oxidation of CPT &#8211; electronic structure calculations &#8211; were carried out at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p) level to explore the reactivity of O2 molecules adding sequentially to cyclopentyl radicals. Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2 is HO2 elimination yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2 addition &#8211; the dissociation of hydroperoxide &#8211; were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis provides access to different sized substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs). The use of a key synthon in a sequence of macrocyclization by cross&#8208;coupling with different reaction partners followed by aromatization allows a modular build&#8208;up. The controlled introduction of substituents enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement of these molecular carbon allotropes in the solid state.







Abstract
Herein, we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different sizes. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared by [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization through single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straightforward manner. The tBu ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van der Waals interactions that exhibits one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube direction, thus opening new avenues in the crystal design of CPPs.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes**
</title>

4,5&#8208;Diazafluorene&#8208;based ligands are notable analogues of the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyls, but little is known about their ability to stabilize reduced organometallic complexes. Here, synthetic, structural, and electrochemical studies of [Cp*Rh] complexes bearing 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) and related analogues have been used to show that Me2daf can stabilize electron&#8208;rich species through &#960;&#8208;backbonding and concomitant charge delocalization. In light of this, Me2daf can be concluded to be a promising building block for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.







Abstract
Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me2daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me2daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me2daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Eucophylline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline  1  was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The elaboration of the latter is based on two strategies relying on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208;cyanation and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation respectively of enantiopure substituted cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes. Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[  b  ][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of  1  , which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Substituted p&#8208;Tert&#8208;Butylcalix[4]Arene with Phosphoryl and Salicylamide Functional Groups: Synthesis, Complexation and Selective Extraction of f&#8208;Element Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand H2L is an effective extraction agent for selective removal of uranyl salts from aqueous rare&#8208;earth containing solutions. As the separation factor &#223;U/Ln is &#8764;100 in a weakly acidic pH range, a complete separation of uranyl from aqueous trivalent lanthanide solutions is expected to be achieved with few separation steps. The separation factors at pH&#8197;6.0 are 121 (UO22+/La3+) and 70 (UO22+/Yb3+)!







Abstract
A new series of lanthanide (1&#8211;5) and uranyl (6) complexes with a tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand H2L is described. The coordination environment for the Ln3+ and UO22+ ions is provided by phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups appended to the lower rim of the p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene scaffold. Ligand interactions with lanthanide cations (light: La3+, Pr3+; intermediate: Eu3+ and Gd3+; and heavy: Yb3+), as well as the uranyl cation (UO22+) is examined in the solution and solid state, respectively with spectrophotometric titration and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The ligand is fully deprotonated in the complexation of trivalent lanthanide ions forming di&#8208;cationic complexes 2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;M&#8201;:&#8201;L, [Ln2(L)2(H2O)]2+ (1&#8211;5), in solution, whereas uranyl formed a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;M&#8201;:&#8201;L complex [UO2(L)(MeOH)]&#8734; (6) that demonstrated very limited solubility in 12 organic solvents. Solvent extraction behaviour is examined for cation selectivity and extraction efficiency. H2L was found to be an effective extracting agent for UO22+ over La3+ and Yb3+ cations.

The compound Li5SnP3 completes for x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 (x=0&#8211;1) of lithium&#8208;ion conducting phosphidostannates. The thorough investigation of the crystal structure as well as the materials properties applying X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as NMR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy allows for a detailed comparison of the materials structure&#8208;property relationships, and thus, improves the understanding of the conduction mechanism within solid ion conductors.







Abstract
The targeted search for suitable solid&#8208;state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material. Thus, the investigation of various ionic conductors with respect to their structural composition is crucial for the design of next&#8208;generation materials as demanded. We report here on Li5SnP3 which completes with x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 of the fast lithium&#8208;ion conductors &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Li8SnP4 (x=0.5) and Li14SnP6 (x=1).

The correlation between the ionic conductivity and the occupation of octahedral and tetrahedral sites in a close&#8208;packed array of P atoms in the series of compounds is discussed. We conclude from this series that in order to receive fast ion conductors a partial occupation of the octahedral vacancies seems to be crucial.

&lt;p&gt;The targeted search for suitable solid-state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material.

         <title>Understanding the Influence of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diazo Compounds on the Catalyst Efficiency of B(C6F5)3 Towards Carbene Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations were carried out to interpret electronic effects of the substituents attached (electron donating/withdrawing substituents) to either side of a diazo functionality towards the ease of carbene generation from the corresponding diazo compounds in presence or absence of catalytic amounts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].







Abstract
Diazo compounds have been largely used as carbene precursors for carbene transfer reactions in a variety of functionalization reactions. However, the ease of carbene generation from the corresponding diazo compounds depends upon the electron donating/withdrawing substituents either side of the diazo functionality. These groups strongly impact the ease of N2 release. Recently, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] has been shown to be an alternative transition metal&#8208;free catalyst for carbene transfer reactions. Herein, a density functional theory (DFT) study on the generation of carbene species from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds using catalytic amounts of B(C6F5)3 is reported. The significant finding is that the efficiency of the catalyst depends directly on the nature of the substituents on both the aryl ring and the carbonyl group of the substrate. In some cases, the boron catalyst has negligible effect on the ease of the carbene formation, while in other cases there is a dramatic reduction in the activation energy of the reaction. This direct dependence is not commonly observed in catalysis and this finding opens the way for intelligent design of this and other similar catalytic reactions.

         <title>Formation of Supramolecular Nanostructures through in Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of a Biocatalytically Constructed Dipeptide Hydrazide**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ self&#8208;assembly of a biocatalytically constructed dipeptide hydrazide gives rise to supramolecular hydrogels consisting of networks of supramolecular nanoarchitectures under mild aqueous conditions. Moreover, post&#8208;assembly modification through hydrazone bond formation enables the decoration of the prefabricated supramolecular architectures. We believe that these findings could extend the molecular toolbox for programmable supramolecular nanostructures guided by protease&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly and subsequent post&#8208;assembly modification based on hydrazone formation.







Abstract
Aqueous self&#8208;assembly of short peptides has attracted growing attention for the construction of supramolecular materials for various bioapplications. Herein, we describe how the thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a dipeptide hydrazide from an N&#8208;protected amino acid and an amino acid hydrazide leads to the formation of thermally stable supramolecular hydrogels. In addition, we demonstrate the post&#8208;assembly modification of the supramolecular architectures constructed in&#8197;situ tethering hydrazide groups as a chemical handle by means of fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Light&#8208;Sensitive Phenacyl Crosslinked Dextran Hydrogels for Controlled Delivery**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer phenacyl crosslinked hydrogels that can release doxorubicin, bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G by using light (254&#8197;nm&#8211;375&#8197;nm) as a trigger are reported. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (QY, 14&#8201;%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials enable controlled release of loaded drug molecules and biomolecules. Controlled release of potent chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agents is crucial to reduce unwanted side effects. In an effort to develop controlled release strategies that can be triggered by using Cerenkov luminescence, we have developed polymer hydrogels that can release bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G by using light (254&#8197;nm&#8211;375&#8197;nm) as a trigger. We describe the synthesis and photochemical characterization of two light sensitive phenacyl bis&#8208;azide crosslinkers that are used to prepare transparent self&#8208;supporting hydrogel patches. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (14&#8201;%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375&#8197;nm light. We used the extended phenacyl crosslinker for the preparation of protein&#8208;loaded dextran hydrogel patches, which showed efficient and selective dosed release of bovine serum albumin or immunoglobulin G after irradiation with 375&#8197;nm light. Cerenkov&#8208;triggered release is as yet inconclusive due to unexpected side&#8208;reactivity. Based on the high quantum yield, efficient release and large overlap with the Cerenkov window, we envision application of these photosensitive soft materials in radiation targeted drug release.

         <title>An Adaptive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Exclusive Recognition of p&#8208;Xylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptable microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) has been realized to exhibit the exclusive recognition of p&#8208;xylene over other C8 isomers. The flexible nature of HOF enables specific encapsulation of pX by simultaneously global and local structural transformations and distortions, providing the promise of developing new strategy and flexible HOF materials for those challenging molecular recognition and separations.







Abstract
Separation of xylene isomers is one of the most important but most challenging and energy&#8208;intensive separation processes in the petrochemical industry. Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;29) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of p&#8208;xylene (pX) over its isomers of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and 1H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation from the as&#8208;synthesized HOF&#8208;29 to the pX exclusively included HOF&#8208;29&#8835;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF-29) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;-(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (pX) over its isomers of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (oX) and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation from the as-synthesized HOF-29 to the pX exclusively included HOF-29&#8835;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Addition of Grignard Reagents to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Bulky turbo&#8208;Organomagnesium Anilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding the right amount: The addition of Grignard nucleophiles to carboxylic acids is made difficult by the lower nucleophilicity of these abundant organometallics, the low electrophilicity of carboxylate anions, and the faster over&#8208;addition to any ketones produced. Herein we introduce a simple magnesium anilide additive that enhances the nucleophilicity of Grignard reagents towards aliphatic carboxylates and stabilizes the product towards over&#8208;addition side reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of ketones through addition of organometallic reagents to aliphatic carboxylic acids is a straightforward strategy that is limited to organolithium reagents. More desirable Grignard reagents can be activated and controlled with a bulky aniline&#8208;derived turbo&#8208;Hauser base. This operationally simple procedure allows the straightforward preparation of a variety of aliphatic and perfluoroalkyl ketones alike from functionalized alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl Grignard reagents.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multilayered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality patterns are commonly observed in the universe and in nature, particularly at micro&#8208; and macrolevels governing the origin of life on earth. Multilayer folding 3D chirality was discovered as a new addition to the chirality family, which is now achieved at a macromolecular level through asymmetric catalytic polymerization. These polymers show conformational flexibility upon pushing and releasing operations providing a variety of molecular energy levels. Therefore, they can have unique photo and electronic properties and it is anticipated that they will have a great impact on chemistry and materials science in the future. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104102).

         <title>Exploring the Association of Electron&#8208;Donating Corroles with Phthalocyanines as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;donating corroles (Cor) were integrated with electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanines (Pc) to afford two different non&#8208;covalent Cor&#8226;Pc systems. At the forefront was the coordination between a 10&#8208;  meso  &#8208;pyridine Cor and a ZnPc. The complexation was corroborated in a combination of NMR, absorption, and fluorescence assays, and revealed association with binding constants as high as 10  6  M  &#8208;1  . Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies evidenced that regardless of exciting Cor or Pc, the charge&#8208;separated state evolved efficiently in both cases, followed by a slow charge&#8208;recombination to reinstate the ground state. The introduction of non&#8208;covalent linkages between Cor and Pc induces appreciable sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and transfer of charges when compared with covalently linked Cor&#8208;Pc conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Variediene Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five analogs of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) with additional or shifted Me groups were converted with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and the fungal variediene synthase from  Aspergillus brasiliensis  (AbVS). These enzymatic reactions resulted in the formation of several new terpene analogs that were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Several DMAPP analogs showed a changed reactivity giving access to compounds with unusual skeletons. Their formation is mechanistically rationalised and the absolute configurations of all obtained compounds were determined through a stereoselective deuteration strategy, revealing absolute configurations that are analogous to that of the natural enzyme product variediene.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibril structure demonstrates the role of iodine labelling on a pentapeptide self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodination has long been employed as a successful labelling strategy to gain structural insights into proteins and other biomolecules  via  several techniques, including Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP&#8208;MS), and single&#8208;crystal crystallography. However, when dealing with smaller biomolecular systems, interactions driven by iodine may significantly alter their self&#8208;assembly behaviour. The engineering of amyloidogenic peptides for the development of ordered nanomaterials has greatly benefitted from this possibility. Still, to date, iodination has exclusively been applied to aromatic residues. In this work, an aliphatic bis&#8208;iodinated amino acid was synthesized and included into a custom pentapeptide, which showed enhanced fibrillogenic behaviour. Peptide single crystal X&#8208;ray structure and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self&#8208;assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxidase&#8208;Mimetic Copper&#8208;doped Carbon&#8208;Dots for Oxidative Stress&#8208;Mediated Broad&#8208;Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doped CDs (Cu&#8208;CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase&#8208;mimicking property of the Cu&#8208;CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram&#8208;negative/positive models against which Cu&#8208;CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5 &#181;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu&#8208;CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H  2  O  2  and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment&#8208;responsive antimicrobial nano&#8208;agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate via two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme&#8208;[4Fe4S]&#8208;cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme&#8208;globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti&#8208;browning, and advance oxidation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient synthesis of oxaboracyclic compounds based on naphthalene and biphenyl backbone and phase&#8208;dependent luminescence of their chelate complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The approach to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered oxaboraheterocycles based on naphthalene or biphenyl backbones was developed. The key synthetic step involved Br/Li exchange in respective potassium (bromoaryl)trifluoroborates followed by quenching with selected electrophiles (CO  2  , DMF, Me  2  Si(H)Cl) and hydrolytic workup. Two ring&#8208;expanded benzoxaborole congeners were obtained by an additional reduction step with LiAlH  4  or NaBH  4  . The obtained boracyclic compounds were characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Specifically, biphenyl&#8208;based systems show dynamic behaviour interpreted in terms of inversion of non&#8208;planar 7&#8208;membered boraheterocycles. The acidity of the obtained compounds varies very strongly (  p  K  a  ranges from 3.1&#8722;9.6) depending on their structure. Due to the enhanced boron Lewis acidity, selected compounds were used as a basis for luminescent complexes with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. A strong phase&#8208;dependent variation of emission band maximum (480&#8722;527 nm) and photoluminescence quantum yield (10&#8722;95%) was observed, which was rationalized in terms of specific aggregation effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the germanium distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 zeolites by density functional theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like  d4r  units and [4&#183;5  6  ] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of  d4r  cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages, in accordance with  19  F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#183;5  6  ] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge = 6).. Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding  19  F&#8208;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8211;F bond in Fumaryl fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF  5  (X = H, D; M = As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid in reference to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  ]  +  [MF  6  ]  &#8211;  (M = As, Sb) and [C  4  H  2  X  2  F  2  O  2  ]  2+  ([MF  6  ]  &#8211;  )  2  (X = H, D; M = As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low&#8208;temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses were carried out for [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  ]  +  [SbF  6  ]  &#8211;  as well as for [C  4  H  4  F  2  O  2  ]  2+  ([MF  6  ]  &#8211;  )  2  (M = As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C  4  H  4  F  2  O  2  &#183; 2 HF]  2+  and [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  &#183; HF]  +  on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. In addition, Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps combined with Natural Population Analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge related properties of the diprotonated species. The C&#8211;F bond lengths in the protonated dication are considerably reduced on account of the +R effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of meta&#8208;Bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal free method for the synthesis of meta &#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta &#8208;trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3&#8208;tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (30&#8208;81%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.</dc:description>

Unsymmetrical and symmetrical alkynes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with tertiary amines in the presence of a cationic titanium catalyst system, which is generated in&#8197;situ. The products obtained are synthetically and pharmaceutically very interesting tertiary allylamines, which are formed in very good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent stereoselectivity. A major highlight of the work is the successful conversion of trimethylamine into N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;E&#8208;allylamines.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes with tertiary amines take place in the presence of catalytic amounts of TiBn4, Ph3C[B(C6F5)4], and a sterically demanding aminopyridinato ligand precursor. The resulting products, synthetically and pharmaceutically useful tertiary &#946;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic amines, are formed in convincing yields and with excellent stereoselectivity. Particularly promising for future applications is the fact that even the industrial side product trimethylamine can be used as a substrate.

         <title>Novel Lipophilic Fluorophores with Highly Acidity&#8208;Dependent Two&#8208;Photon Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon photophysical characterization of four novel lipophilic pH probes based on phosphazene modified coumarin&#8208;151. These probes are shown to have spectral features robust to variation of local polarity from different solvents, yet display easily separable neutral and protonated forms, with maximum 2PA brightness of, &#963;2PA&#8901;&#981;em=10&#8211;13&#8197;GM. Nonlinear optical properties are quantitatively determined experimentally and compared to computational models.







Abstract
Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine the high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Herein we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region &#955;2PA=550&#8211;1000&#8197;nm, observing 2PA cross sections of &#963;2PA=10&#8211;20&#8197;GM, with an associated 2PEF brightness of 10&#8211;13&#8197;GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and n&#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.

         <title>A Masked Form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow Intermediate for the Diastereoselective FLP&#8208;Type Activation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compound 3 featuring an FLP&#8208;type activated CO2 is used as a masked form of an elusive O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the complete diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes. Kinetic and theoretical investigations shed light on the mechanism at play.







Abstract
Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry is unprecedented. Described herein is the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds 4&#8211;8) and in solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (compounds 4&#8211;6). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.

         <dc:description>Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as&#160;two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine  &#160;TP&#8208;2Bzim  are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two  TP&#8208;2Bzim  derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the  TP&#8208;RePyta  probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the  TP&#8208;Br  probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labeling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of  TP&#8208;Br  was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of  TP&#8208;Br  and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Isoxazolines: Method and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline  via  an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally,  in&#8208;situ  reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have also been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (timecourse) modeling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesized involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.</dc:description>

Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline  via  an electrochemically enabled regio- and diastereoselective reaction with electron-deficient alkenes. Additionally,  in-situ  reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have also been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (timecourse) modeling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical-mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesized involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chloromethyl Glycosides as Versatile Synthons to Prepare Glycosyloxymethyl&#8208;Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monosaccharides were introduced on drug molecules to improve their solubility, metabolic stability and oral bioavailability. A new chloromethyl glycoside synthon was developed to enable the synthesis of numerous monosaccharide prodrugs.







Abstract
This work investigates the addition of monosaccharides to marketed drugs to improve their pharmacokinetic properties for oral absorption. To this end, a set of chloromethyl glycoside synthons were developed to prepare a variety of glycosyloxymethyl&#8208;prodrugs derived from 5&#8208;fluorouracil, thioguanine, propofol and losartan. Drug release was studied in&#8197;vitro using &#946;&#8208;glucosidase confirming rapid conversion of the monosaccharide prodrugs to release the parent drug, formaldehyde and the monosaccharide. To showcase this prodrug approach, a glucosyloxymethyl conjugate of the tetrazole&#8208;containing drug losartan was used for in&#8197;vivo experiments and showed complete release of the drug in a dog&#8208;model.

         <title>The Impact of Research Culture on Mental Health &amp; Diversity in STEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper focuses on key aspects of academic research culture that can impact STEM researcher mental health: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape, as well as exploring why mental health matters for researchers. Further, key recommendations are provided and actionable steps are outlined that institutions can take to make research in STEM inclusive for all.







Abstract
The onset of COVID&#8208;19, coupled with the finer lens placed on systemic racial disparities within our society, has resulted in increased discussions around mental health. Despite this, mental health struggles in research are still often viewed as individual weaknesses and not the result of a larger dysfunctional research culture. Mental health interventions in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) academic community often focus on what individuals can do to improve their mental health instead of focusing on improving the research environment. In this paper, we present four aspects of research that may heavily impact mental health based on our experiences as research scientists: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape. Based on these aspects, we propose systemic changes that institutions must adopt to ensure their research culture is supportive and allows everyone to thrive.

         <title>The apparently unreactive substrate facilitates the electron transfer for dioxygen activation in Rieske dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive O2 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to O2 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of O2, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme FeII center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic O2 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme FeII sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme FeII in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive O2 activation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The copper(I), silver(I), and gold(I) metals bind &#960;&#8208;ligands by &#963;&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;back bonding interactions. We investigated these interactions using bidentate ancillary ligands with electron donating and withdrawing substituents. The &#960;&#8208;ligands span from ethylene to larger terminal and internal alkenes and alkynes. By means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR, and IR spectroscopy and gas phase experiments, we show that the binding energies increase in the order Ag &lt; Cu &lt; Au and the binding energies are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. By modulating the electron density at the metal using substituents on the ancillary ligands, we show that the &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction plays a dominant role for the binding in the copper and gold complexes.</dc:description>

Boronic acids. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings, providing a valuable molecular insight into the rational design of novel catalysts and inhibitors.







Abstract
Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids; specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.

         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8722;Organic Cages and Counterions Regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When introducing extra salts into Cage 1 aqueous solution, most salts (Na2SO4, NaNO3, NaClO4, and NaSCN) can trigger larger&#8208;sized blackberry; while no clear change can be observed for Cage 2 solution, except NaSCN, which can be attribute to the thick hydration shell of Cage 2, inhibiting the counterion&#8211;macroion interaction.







Abstract
A unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8722;organic cages (MOCs) and external counteranions in aqueous media was observed. Similar to many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures through counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counteranions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crystallographically characterized phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct mimics frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair reactivity. In the presence of alkynes, alkenes and esters, a facile conversion to novel phosphinine&#8208;based species is achieved even at room temperature. Our results provide fascinating new perspectives for the future, particularly with respect to the activation of small molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104135).

         <title>Sandacrabins &#8211; Structurally Unique Antiviral RNA Polymerase Inhibitors from a Rare Myxobacterium**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;nucleoside RdRp inhibitors. A family of unprecedented farnesylated dimethylbenzimidazoles called the sandacrabins have been discovered from a new myxobacterial Sandaracinus species. They exhibit antiviral activities that could be correlated to inhibition of the RNA synthesis as their potential antiviral mode of action. This study describes their structure elucidation, biosynthetic origin, total synthesis and biological evaluation.







Abstract
Structure elucidation and total synthesis of five unprecedented terpenoid&#8208;alkaloids, the sandacrabins, are reported, alongside with the first description of their producing organism Sandaracinus defensii MSr10575, which expands the Sandaracineae family by only its second member. The genome sequence of S. defensii as presented in this study was utilized to identify enzymes responsible for sandacrabin formation, whereby dimethylbenzimidazol, deriving from cobalamin biosynthesis, was identified as key intermediate. Biological activity profiling revealed that all sandacrabins except congener A exhibit potent antiviral activity against the human pathogenic coronavirus HCoV229E in the three digit nanomolar range. Investigation of the underlying mode of action discloses that the sandacrabins inhibit the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase complex, highlighting them as structurally distinct non&#8208;nucleoside RNA synthesis inhibitors. The observed segregation between cell toxicity at higher concentrations and viral inhibition opens the possibility for their medicinal chemistry optimization towards selective inhibitors.

         <title>Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic use of metallic couples acting in a cooperative way arises as a powerful tool affording novel and efficient chemical transformations. In this article, a series of complexes containing M&#8722;M&#8242; bonds (M=Pd, Pt; M&#8242;=Ag, Au) is described. They can be regarded as arrested intermediates or snapshots of a transmetallation process that becomes &#8220;frustrated&#8221; given the nature of the &#8220;disputed&#8221; R fragment. Still, some gradation in the transfer can be evaluated depending on the M&#8722;M&#8242; couple, and all together they compose a short movie allowing the progression of such processes to be ranked. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Baya, A. Mart&#237;n, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104538).

         <title>Electrostatic Perturbations in the Substrate&#8208;Binding Pocket of Taurine/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate Dioxygenase Determine its Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on large active site models of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase show that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects of polar and charged amino acid residues are essential for the correct description of the regioselectivity of taurine activation by this enzyme. In particular, a charged histidine residue incurs a local electric field effect that guides the reactivity to C1&#8208;hydroxylation.







Abstract
Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C1&#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C2&#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C1&#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD was performed. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C1&#8722;H and C2&#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the pro&#8208;R C1&#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. The large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Density functional theory&lt;/b&gt; calculations on large active site models of taurine/&#945;-ketoglutarate dioxygenase show that second-coordination sphere effects of polar and charged amino acid residues are essential for the correct description of the regioselectivity of taurine activation by this enzyme. In particular, a charged histidine residue incurs a local electric field effect that guides the reactivity to C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroxylation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taurine/&#945;-ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas-phase the C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2-hydroxytaurine products. To this end, a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD was performed. The calculations show that the second-coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H and C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the &lt;i&gt;pro&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. The large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Release of Molecular Cargo from Polymer Systems by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical design: The incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, known as mechanophores, into macromolecular systems has provided access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. We present examples of molecular cargo release systems and their sonochemical activation by ultrasound. Important design concepts of these advanced materials, as well as their synthesis and applications, are discussed.







Abstract
The design and manipulation of (multi)functional materials at the nanoscale holds the promise of fuelling tomorrow's major technological advances. In the realm of macromolecular nanosystems, the incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, so called mechanophores, has resulted in unprecedented access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. Among the diverse force&#8208;activated motifs, the on&#8208;demand release or activation of compounds, such as catalysts, drugs, or monomers for self&#8208;healing, are sought&#8208;after since they enable triggering pristine small molecule function from macromolecular frameworks. Here, we highlight examples of molecular cargo release systems from polymer&#8208;based architectures in solution by means of sonochemical activation by ultrasound (ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemistry). Important design concepts of these advanced materials are discussed, as well as their syntheses and applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8208;1.0 mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product = 475 and for unsymmetrical product = 390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes&#8208;based biological relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. A total synthesis of anti&#8208;breast cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Aldol Reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to Alkyl Aryl Ketones: Silanes as Activator and Transient Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reductive aldol reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed in the presence of copper/bisphosphine catalysts. The reaction demonstrated the usability of in situ protection of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane for the reductive C&#8722;C bond formation. The Si&#8722;O bond in the aldol products is readily cleaved by a standard workup, showing the silane worked as not only an activator but also a transient protecting group.







Abstract
The first enantioselective reductive aldol reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed by employing a copper/bisphosphine catalyst. The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with an alkyl aryl ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.

         <title>H/F substitution induced large increase of Tc in a 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite multifunctional compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing attention to study perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains significant challenges to simultaneously achieve multifunction and control of structural phase transition temperature in hybrid compounds. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ = quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2 RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ = 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169 K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution generated Rb&#8722;F coordinate between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.</dc:description>

Here, we report two three-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid rare-earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ = quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2 RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ = 4-fluoro-quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169 K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution generated Rb&#8722;F coordinate between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi-functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, this reaction is even today mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8208;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8208;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8208;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in FLP&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two B  II  atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8208;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8208;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B  2  (hpp)  2  (OTf)  2  (hpp = 1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and a phosphino&#8208;pyridine, establishing B&#8208;N and B&#8208;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8208;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8208;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>On the road for more efficient biocompatible two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Red to NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3 650 GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live&#8208;cell two&#8208;photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective catalysis via single Zr atom catalysis in chelated cage embedded in a flexible piezoelectrical matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridyzing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90% after 100 min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.</dc:description>

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Roll out the barrelene: The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct has been achieved for the first time. The novel Lewis adduct shows rapid insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene, whereas a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. Reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These subsequently undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of alkenes and alkynes to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.







Abstract
A phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct of a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 has been synthesized and characterized crystallographically for the first time. The reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8211;borane adducts that is determined by the Lewis basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. A hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8722;C&#8801;CH and styrene to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roll out the barrelene&lt;/b&gt;: The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct has been achieved for the first time. The novel Lewis adduct shows rapid insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene, whereas a hitherto unknown dihydro-1-phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. Reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1-&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-phosphininium salts. These subsequently undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of alkenes and alkynes to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1-&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-phosphabarrelenium salts.

         <title>Bright Luminescence by Combining Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane with a Boron&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Building Block</title>

Coupling through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space by a chiral building block results in excellent optical and chiroptical properties: &#1013; up to 2.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, &#934;PL up to 0.70, and intense, mirror&#8208;image electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals of a magnitude of 10&#8722;3 for the absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
Novel BN&#8208;doped compounds based on chiral, tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane and NBN&#8208;benzo[f,g]tetracene were synthesized by Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara coupling. Conjugated ethynyl linkers allow electronic communication between the &#960;&#8208;electron systems through&#8208;bond, whereas through&#8208;space interactions are provided by strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap between the pairs of NBN&#8208;building blocks. Excellent optical and chiroptical properties in racemic and enantiopure conditions were measured, with molar absorption coefficients up to &#1013;=2.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934;PL=0.70, and intense, mirror&#8208;image electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals of the magnitude of 10&#8722;3 for the absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors. Computed glum,calcd. values match the experimental ones. Electroanalytical data show both oxidation and reduction of the ethynyl&#8208;linked tetra&#8208;NBN&#8208;substituted paracyclophane, with an overlap of two redox processes for oxidation leading to a diradical dication.

         <title>Ferroelectrics in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure, nature and future: This review classifies ferroelectric photocatalysts into perovskite, layered bismuth&#8208;based and other materials based on their crystal structure. Progress in ferroelectrics research is then summarized including photocatalytic pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, current challenges and future prospects are provided with the purpose for presenting a deep insight and guideline for future research into ferroelectrics.







Abstract
The rapid development of industrialization and population has brought water, air&#8208;pollution and energy crises. Solar&#8208;driven catalysis is expected to relieve these issues. However, limited by poor light harvesting, serious charge recombination of semiconductors, and high surface reaction barriers, the low efficiency of solar conversion is far from satisfactory for industrial needs. Ferroelectrics are considered to be promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3 and LiNbO3, layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6, and other ferroelectrics are introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method are highlighted. Subsequently, research progress in ferroelectrics for photocatalysis is summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts are provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present deep insight and a guideline for future research work into ferroelectrics.

         <title>Interstitial Hydrides in Nanoclusters can Reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and Form Stable Superatoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept proposes that interstitial hydrides in high&#8208;nuclearity coinage metal nanoclusters can reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and form stable superatoms. This implies the hydride species can induce internal self&#8208;redox reactions (no external reducing agent needed) but as prerequisite the transformed clusters seem to have a similar core framework structure. These observations have implications in catalytic and energy cycles.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity clusters resemble the closest model between the determination of atomically precise chemical species and the bulk metallic version thereof, and both impacts on a variety of applications, including catalysis, optics, sensors, and new energy sources. Our interest lies with the nanoclusters of the Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) metals stabilized by dichalcogenido and hydrido ligands. Herein, we describe superatoms formed by the clusters and their relationship with precursor hydrido clusters. Specifically, our concept seeks to demonstrate a possible correlation that exist between hydrido clusters (and nanoalloys) and the formation of superatoms, with the loss of hydrides and typically with release of H2 gas. These reactions appear to be internal self&#8208;redox reactions and require no additional reducing agent, but does seem to require a similar core structure. Knowledge of such processes could provide insight into how clusters grow and an understanding in bridging the atomically precise cluster &#8211; metal nanoparticle mechanism.

         <title>Unlocking the hydrolytic mechanism of GH92 &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;mannosidases: computation inspires using C&#8208;glycosides as Michaelis complex mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational changes in a sugar moiety along the hydrolytic pathway are key to understand the mechanism of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and to design new inhibitors. The two predominant itineraries for mannosidases go via OS2 &#8594; B2,5 &#8594; 1S5 and 3S1 &#8594; 3H4 &#8594; 1C4. For the CAZy family 92, the conformational itinerary was unknown. Published complexes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH92 catalyst with a S&#8208;glycoside and mannoimidazole indicate a 4C1 &#8594; 4H5/1S5 &#8594; 1S5 mechanism. However, as observed with the GH125 family, S&#8208;glycosides may not act always as good mimics of GH&#8217;s natural substrate. Here we present a cooperative study between computations and experiments where our results predict the E5 &#8594; B2,5/1S5 &#8594; 1S5 pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of C&#8208;disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient oligomerization of aromatic amino acids induced by gaps in four&#8208;helix bundles of DNA or RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of peptides from amino acids is one of the processes associated with life. Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA&#8208;induced are of particular interest. We had previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5'&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HB's. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation of Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be and Mg (Route&#8208;I), to Pb (Route&#8208;II), Zn, Cd (Route&#8208;III) in a flexible fluorooxoborate framework hierarchically enhances the optical anisotropy up to 46.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth, d10 electron configuration, and 6s2 lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework from AEB4O6F2 (AE=Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6&#8201;% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (route&#8208;I), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB4O6F2 structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146&#8197;nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm, and the PbB4O6F2 structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194&#8197;nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.

         <title>Pedal to the Metal: The Homogeneous Catalysis of the Native Chemical Ligation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic catalysis is key to the acceleration of the native chemical ligation (NCL) reaction and thus, to its application for protein synthesis, functionalization and utilization in chemical biology. The present concept article discusses the fundamental principles of NCL rate and catalysis with emphasis on thiol nucleophiles.







Abstract
The native chemical ligation reaction of peptide thioesters with cysteinyl peptides is a pivotal chemical process in the production of native or modified peptides and proteins, and well beyond in the preparation of various biomolecule analogs and materials. To benefit from this reaction at its fullest and to access all the possible applications, the experimentalist needs to know the factors affecting its rate and how to control it. This concept article presents the fundamental principles underlying the rate of the native chemical ligation and its homogeneous catalysis by nucleophiles. It has been prepared to serve as a quick guide in the search for an appropriate catalyst.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical was synthesized and exhibited a peculiarly high stability and a self&#8208;assembling ability to form a &#960;&#8208;dimer stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction. The polycondensation of the silyl&#8208;substituted TOT yielded a microporous organosiloxane with a large surface area and a micropore of &#8764;1&#8197;nm diameter. The TOT unit incorporated in the organosiloxane&#8208;wall exhibited a reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability in the chemical and electrochemical methods.







Abstract
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to TOT neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including TOT units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups and formed microporous structures with &#8764;1&#8197;nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of TOT units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the TOT units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of TOT units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.

Frustrated R&#8208;transfer processes: The catalytic use of bimetallic couples acting in a cooperative way affords novel and efficient chemical transformations. The presence of M&#8722;M&#8217; interactions is a key feature in these processes. We describe here a complete series of complexes containing G10M&#8722;G11M bonds (G10M=Pd, Pt; G11M=Ag, Au) that can be considered as snapshots of transmetallation processes. All together they compose a sort of short movie that allows to rank the progression of such processes depending on of the metals involved.







Abstract
Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh3)Pd&#8208;G11M(PPh3)](ClO4) (G11M=Au (3), Ag (4); CNC=2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh3)Pd}2G11M](ClO4) (G11M=Au (6), Ag (5)) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8722;Au &gt; Pt&#8722;Au &gt; Pd&#8722;Ag &gt; Pt&#8722;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substantial hyperpolarization of nuclear spins in alkene products was observed in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen mediated by a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst. The observed effects are unusual, as the mechanism of the reaction is not pairwise, thus allowing hyperpolarization of only one of two protons at double bonds. Moreover, this enabled various important intermediates to be characterized by hyperpolarized 1H, 11B and 15N NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H2 transfer to alkynes that normally prevents parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) from being observed. Nevertheless, the specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled the detection of important HCAT&#8208;alkyne&#8208;H2 intermediates through substantial 1H, 11B and 15N signal enhancement and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.

     alt="Parahydrogen-Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal-Free Catalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Substantial hyperpolarization&lt;/b&gt; of nuclear spins in alkene products was observed in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen mediated by a metal-free hydroborane catalyst. The observed effects are unusual, as the mechanism of the reaction is not pairwise, thus allowing hyperpolarization of only one of two protons at double bonds. Moreover, this enabled various important intermediates to be characterized by hyperpolarized &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Comparative Study of Nitro&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalized ZnII&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers (CPs) as Fluorescent Turn&#8208;On Probes for Rapid and Selective Detection of H2S in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the reduction approach, newly synthesized coordination polymers (CPs) containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) was shown to exhibit an excellent ability for the detection of extracellular and intracellular H2S. The CP&#8208;1, containing azido functunal group acted as an efficient fluorencent turn&#8208;on probe with lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the reported Zn&#8208;based probes to date, whereas the nitro group containing CP&#8208;2 was unable to sense H2S due to its framework disruption.







Abstract
Selective detection of H2S in the cellular systems using fluorescent CPs/MOFs is of great scientific interest due to their outstanding aqueous stability, biocompatibility and real&#8208;time detection ability. Fabrication of such materials using complete biologically essential elements and applying them as an efficient biosensor is still quite challenging. In this context, two newly synthesized CPs containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) and nitro/azido functional groups into the framework to sense extracellular and intracellular H2S by reducing into respective amines are presented. The CP&#8208;1 containing the azide group acted as an efficient fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe with the lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the Zn&#8208;based probes reported till date. Moreover, CP&#8208;1 exhibited green luminescence in live cells after imaging a very low concentration of H2S, whereas the nitro analogue CP&#8208;2 could not detect the target analyte due to its framework disruption.

A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclooligomerization of bifunctional monomers possessing triazolyl (carbene precursor) and vinyl groups at 2,3&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;positions on the thiophene ring is studied.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multilayered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D folding polymers by using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling in the presence of chiral catalysts. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Unprecedented chiral multilayer folding 3D polymers have been assembled and regulated by uniform and differentiated aromatic chromophore units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers were proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycouplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of the corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute configuration and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61&#8201;960 Mw/41&#8201;900 Mn and m/z 4317 for polymers and oligomers, as confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, indicated that these frameworks were composed of multiple stacked layers. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive Monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH Molecule through Nonadiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH molecule was prepared in the gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). The divergent chemistries of germanium versus carbon are reflected when comparing the acetylene isomers with the isovalent germanium analogues. This reaction deepens our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.







Abstract
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH (X1A&#8242;) molecule was prepared in the gas phase by bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). Electronic structure calculations revealed that this reaction commenced on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond over a submerged barrier to form the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH3); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH3 predominantly isomerized through two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H2GeGe) and dibridged (Ge(&#956;&#8208;H2)Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C2H2 surface, thus deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.

         <title>Simultaneous Organic and Inorganic Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry within Pillararene&#8208;Protein Cage Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules provides a powerful bottom&#8208;up strategy to build functional nanostructures and materials. Among the different biomacromolecules, protein cages offer various advantages including uniform size, versatility, multi&#8208;modularity and high stability. Additionally, protein cage crystals present confined microenvironments with well&#8208;defined dimensions. On the other hand, molecular hosts, such as cyclophanes, possess a defined cavity size and selective recognition of guest molecules. However, successful combination of macrocycles and protein cages to achieve functional co&#8208;crystals have remained limited. In this study, we demonstrate the electrostatic binding between cationic pillar[5]arenes and (apo)ferritin cages, which results in porous and crystalline frameworks. The electrostatically assembled crystals present face&#8208;center cubic (FCC) lattice and have been characterized by means of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo&#8208;TEM. These hierarchical structures result in a multiadsorbent framework capable of hosting both organic and inorganic pollutants, such as dyes and toxic metals, with potential application in water remediation technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of anionic backbone in NHC&#8208;stabilized coinage metal complexes: New precursors for atomic layer deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(  tBu  NHC)(R)] (M = Cu, Ag;  tBu  NHC = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R = diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160 &#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor phase processing of thin films.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S  &#8208;(Trifluoromethyl) benzothioate (TFBT) is developed as an inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and user&#8208;friendly trifluoromethylthiolation reagent, which can be easily synthesized using KF as the only fluorine source. By using TFBT, trifluoromethylthiolates with various counterions can be readily obtained. The synthetic application of TFBT is demonstrated by trifluoromethylthiolation&#8722;halogenation of arynes, bis(trifluoromethylthiolation)&#8208;halogenation of 1,2&#8208;benzdiynes, nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, deoxytrifluoromethylthiolation of alcohols, and cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and vinyl boronic acids.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit (i) high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward anion state, (ii) high glass transition temperature ( T g&#160; &gt;130 &#176;C), and (iii) high triplet energy ( E T&#160; &gt;2.7 eV), thereby enabling approximately 20% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50% (LT 50 ) of 20000&#8211;30000 h at 1000 cd m &#8208;2 . In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential ( I P ), BDE, and&#160; T g&#160; are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208; transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the design of efficient high entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalyst by one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. The strategy allows for control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimising the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The environment affects the electronic density and consequently binding energies of oxygenated intermediates at the metal ion centers. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8208;2 , better than RuO 2 catalyst. The finding involves lattice distortion of the high entropy MOFs provides more strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.</dc:description>

The subsequent Dy  III  &#8208;complexes  5  and  6  display slow relaxation of magnetization at zero field, with relaxation barriers  U  = 70.3 cm  &#8211;1  for  5  , 512.9 and 316.3 cm  &#8211;1  for  6  , respectively. Significantly, the latter complex  5  also exhibit a butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis up to 7 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Mechanosynthesis of Phenytoin, a WHO Essential Medicine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8208;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Here, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e  &#8211;  . Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible Rh  II/I  process at &#8211;0.96 V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc  +/0  ). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon Rh(II) species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]  +  , that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]  +  , and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41 V vs Fc  +/0  that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8211;H moiety by 23 p  K  a  units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by  in situ  1  H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8211;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase sensing based on protein interactions at the catalytic site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependent enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10 nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentration. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for caging living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, we report a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;driven dimerization and self&#8208;assembly of artificial, ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)&#8208;carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.</dc:description>

We also observed that the addition of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self-assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acetylene Derivatives of Cationic Diazaoxatriangulenes and Diaza [4]Helicenes &#8211; Access to Red Emitters and Planar Chiral Stereochemical Traits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic triangulenes, and related helicenes, constitute a rich class of dyes and fluorophores, usually absorbing and emitting light at low energy, in the orange to red domains. Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8208;functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (Dlabs up to 25 nm) and emissions (Dlem up to 73 nm, FPL up to 51%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy (218 K), N&#8208;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (Dd) as high as +1.64 ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273 K with a barrier of ~12 kcal.mol&#8208;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on geometries, stereodynamics and on the large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox replacement of Ag on MOF&#8208;derived Cu/C&#8208;nanoparticles on gas diffusion electrodes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction, bime&#173;tallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to local&#173;ly increase the CO flux for maximizing the conversion rate towards C&#8208;C coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8208;Ag nanostruc&#173;tured catalyst was prepared by a redox replacement process, where the ratio of both metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO  2  conversion to C  2+  products compared to non&#8208;Ag modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and  in&#8208;situ  Raman measurements in a CO  2  gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top bound linear adsorbed &#1645;CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps as evidenced by increasing the &#957;C&#8208;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms are simultane&#173;ously operating towards the production of HCO  2  H and C&#8208;C coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Sandmeyer&#8208;type Halogenation of Arenediazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One hundred and forty years after its discovery, key limitations of the Sandmeyer reaction were overcome. The use of trihalide salts as mediators enable the photochemical conversion of diazonium salts into the corresponding aryl halides without an environmentally problematic transition&#8208;metal mediator. A wide variety of aryl bromides, chlorides and iodides were formed in excellent selectivities for halogenation over hydridodediazotization, obviating the laborious separation of halogenated products from non&#8208;halogenated analogues.@ruhrunibochum







Abstract
Trihalide salts were found to efficiently promote photochemical dediazotizing halogenations of diazonium salts. In contrast to classical Sandmeyer reactions, no metal catalysts are required to achieve high yields and outstanding selectivities for halogenation over competing hydridodediazotization. Convenient protocols are disclosed for synthetically meaningful brominations, iodinations, and chlorinations of diversely functionalized derivatives.

The noble&#8208;gas difluorides, NgF2 (Ng=Kr, Xe), react with MOF4 (M=Mo, W) in HF solvent and melts to form NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4. Structures and bonding were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The NgF2 ligands coordinate to the metal through F&#8208;bridges, where Fb is trans to M=O in FtNgFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 and Fb&#8217; is cis to M=O and trans to M&#8217;=O in FtXeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)Fb&#8242;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M&#8242;OF4.







Abstract
The NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 (Ng=Kr, Xe; M=Mo, W) and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 complexes were synthesized in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent and melts, respectively. Their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structures show NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 have Ft&#8722;Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M arrangements, in which the NgF2 ligands coordinate to MOF4 through Ng&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges. The XeF2 ligands of XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 also coordinate to F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 moieties through Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M bridges to form Ft&#8722;Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M(OF3)&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4, where XeF2 coordinates trans to the M=O bond and Fb&#8217; coordinates trans to the M&#8217;=O bond. The Ng&#8722;Ft, Ng&#8722;Fb, and M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond lengths of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nMOF4 are consistent with MOF4 and F3OM&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;M'OF4 fluoride&#8208;ion affinity trends: CrOF4&lt;MoOF4&lt;WOF4&#8776;F3OMo&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Mo'OF4&lt;F3OW&#8722;Fb&#8217;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W'OF4.

Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show the M&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bonds of NgF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;MOF4 and XeF2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MOF4 are predominantly electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole type bonds.

The impact of clickable side chains and click adducts on heterochiral DNA with complementary strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and their homochiral counterparts with both strands in the &#945;&#8208;d or &#946;&#8208;d configuration is investigated.

Abstract
Anomeric base pairs in heterochiral DNA with strands in the &#945;&#8208;d and &#946;&#8208;d configurations and homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;d configuration were functionalized. The &#945;&#8208;d anomers of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized and functionalized with clickable octadiynyl side chains. Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid&#8208;phase synthesis furnished 12&#8208;mer oligonucleotides, which were hybridized. Pyrene click adducts display fluorescence, a few of them with excimer emission. Tm values and thermodynamic data revealed the following order of duplex stability &#945;/&#945;&#8208;d&#8811;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;d&#8805;&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d. CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and bulky click adducts are well accommodated in the grooves of anomeric DNA. The investigation shows for the first time that anomeric DNAs can be functionalized in the same way as canonical DNA for potential applications in nucleic acid chemistry, chemical biology, and DNA material science.

         <title>Electronic circular dichroism&#8208;circularly polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarize recent works on the discovery of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  e  CP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how  e  CP&#8208;Raman influences  the  I  R  &#8211; I  L  spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of  e  CP&#8208;Raman.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Graphene Quantum Dots Modified Dioxin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework, as an emerging porous nano&#8208;frame structure with pre&#8208;designed structure and custom properties, has been demonstrated as a prospective electrode for rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries. For improving the reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability of COF materials, we propose a GQDs modified COF material (COF&#8208;GQDs) and apply it as the anode for LIBs for the first time. This COF&#8208;GQDs electrode delivers enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance with a large capacity of ~820 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 300 cycles of at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and the improved rate performance. The enhanced lithium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of obvious&#8208;shortened activation process and high reversible capacities, can be attributed to the modification of carboxyl GQDs, which would activate more active sites (activated C=C groups from benzene rings) for lithium&#8208;storage, and provide fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetic. Besides, the decreased interphase resistance, enhanced electronic conductivity, and prevented aggregation of needle&#8208;flake COF structure, originated from the addition of GQDs, lead to the enhanced improved cycling stability of COF&#8208;GQDs electrode. This manuscript can promote the further exploration on the design of COF&#8208;related materials with modification of functionalized carbonaceous materials to achieve the enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Interaction Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer  in silico  et vitro  design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. Using a new iterative design procedure, Interaction Based Drug Design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated.
The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.</dc:description>

The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high-affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymers with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of recent progress aims at the achievements of efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission with stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The stimuli&#8208;responsive factors are composed of light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH. The relationship between luminescent property and stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanism is discussed in detail, and promising opportunities and existing challenges are presented as a guideline for future research in this area.







Abstract
Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.

         <title>An Increment System to Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in all&#8208;meta Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For many chemical phenomena predictive models based on increment systems exist allowing an easy prediction. Despite its low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interaction are ubiquitous in manifold situation ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of different alkyl substituents ranging from Me, Et,  i  Pr up to  t  Bu. Based on this data we were able to implement an increment system for London dispersion for this azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation, which allows to predict the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in this arrangement which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>

         <dc:description>Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, we report on the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts.

These [P(CF  3  )  4&#8208;n  F  n  ]  &#8722;  (n = 0&#8208;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n = 1&#8208;2) or trifluoromethylating (n = 0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  4  ] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  3  F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by&#160;Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (  Frank et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633  ), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X = O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a&#160;&#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations on the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a small amount of silicon to the known composition of RhP3 (centrosymmetric space group Im

We hypothesize that a combination of M&#8722;Tt and M&#8722;Pn bonding favors noncentrosymmetric structures.

Abstract
Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is &#960;&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P. In situ studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.

The nature of metal&#8208;metal bonding between two different kinds of metal sites is essential for understanding these &#8220;xenophilic&#8221; complexes. We used M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analysis on a pair of related diiron complexes; they indicated that the bond order is roughly one&#8208;half. The best electronic structure description is LFeII&#8722;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment.







Abstract
&#8220;Xenophilic&#8221; complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8722;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8722;Fp (LX = &#946;&#8208;aldiminate or &#946;&#8208;diketiminate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into Fe&#8722;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism, and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electrostatic interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8722; &#8220;metalloligand&#8221; as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n = 6&#8208;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain = 60.8 to 73.4 kcal/mol) and very small Egap (~3.0 eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum| ~0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs require robust organic transformations which proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction media for organic synthesis is not evident due to generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentration of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well&#8208;suited for DEL synthesis. Existing examples on micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.</dc:description>

Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  crystallizes in triclinic space group (no. 2) (  Z  = 2,  a  = 6.1869(10),  b  = 7.1736(13),  c  = 8.0391(14) &#197;,  &#945;  = 102.754(8),  &#946;  = 112.032(6),  &#947;  = 104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr:Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of  M  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ] (  M  = Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450 nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656 nm (fwhm = 1922&#8211; 2025 cm  &#8722;1  (72&#8211;87 nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr  2+  by larger Ba  2+  leads to an inversetunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low&#8208;temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.</dc:description>

Depending on the catalyst either none, one or two silyl groups migrate and change their positions in the formed five&#8208;membered rings. The optoelectronic properties are quite similar, whereas the packing motifs differ dramatically.

         <title>A New Variant of Emissive RNA Alphabets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet (  mth  N) consisting of pyrimidines and purines analogues, all derived from methylthieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic core, is described.&#160; Large bathochromic shifts and high microenvironmental susceptibility of their emission relative to previous alphabets derived from thieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  th  N) and isothiazole[4,3&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  tz  N) scaffolds are observed. Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA Polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding  mth  N/  mth  NTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the  mth  N alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Hydroboration of Imines from Combined Computational and Experimental Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed and catalyst&#8208;free hydroboration reactions of imines are attractive due to the mild reaction conditions. In this work, the mechanistic details of the hydroboration reactions of two different kinds of imine with pinacolborane (HBpin) are investigated by combining density functional theory calculations and experimental studies. For the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylidene)aniline catalyzed by tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane (BAr  F  3  ), our calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a boron Lewis acid&#8208;promoted hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical Lewis acid&#8208;activation mechanism. For the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free hydroboration reaction of imine,  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline, our calculations and experimental studies indicate that this reaction is difficult to occur under the reaction conditions reported previously. With a combination of computational and experimental studies, we have established that the commercially available BH  3  &#183;SMe  2  can serve as an efficient catalyst for the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline. The hydroboration reaction catalyzed by BH  3  &#183;SMe  2  is most likely to proceed through a hydroboration/B&#8208;H/B&#8208;N &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis pathway, which is very different from that of the reaction catalyzed by BAr  F  3  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened using a retro&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction under acidic conditions to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene undergo a ring&#8208;opening reaction under strongly acidic conditions, such as TfOH. An investigation of the substitution effect has revealed that the electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of a weaker acid, such as TFA. In addition, the reaction has been successfully applied toward the synthesis of tetracene.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8208;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization processes.
