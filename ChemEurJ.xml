      <title>A Lacunary Polyoxovanadate Precursor and Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Sandwiched Derivatives for Catalytic Oxidation of Sulfides</title>
      <dc:description>
New topology of polyoxovanadates: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV10O28(SeO3)3]8&#8722; ({Se4V10}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se4V10)2M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn). Such new TM&#8208;derivatives can efficiently catalysis heterogeneous oxidation of sulfides in high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions.

      <dc:description>
Organic electrosynthesis guides the way to alkyl arylsulfonates! In an electrochemical multi&#8208;component reaction, an alcohol of choice, an electron&#8208;rich arene, and SO2 are converted to alkyl arylsulfonates. This novel methodology features the first direct synthesis of alkyl arylsulfonates from arenes at mild reaction conditions. No prefunctionalization is required and no DABSO is needed.

      <title>Anthranoxides as Highly Reactive Arynophiles for the Synthesis of Triptycenes</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient method to synthesize triptycenes through the reaction of benzynes and anthranoxides, which are electron&#8208;rich and readily prepared from the corresponding anthrones, is reported. Using this method, 1,9&#8208;syn&#8208;substituted triptycenes were regioselectively obtained employing 3&#8208;methoxybenzynes. This method was also applied to synthesize pentiptycenes. A DFT study revealed that the cycloaddition of lithium anthranoxide and benzyne proceeds stepwise. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, et&#8197;al.

Mixed&#8208;metal selenide anode material: Carbon&#8208;coated porous Ni&#8208;doped CoSe2 (Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C) nanospheres have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a new selenization strategy.

Abstract
Carbon&#8208;layer&#8208;coated porous Ni&#8208;doped CoSe2 (Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C) nanospheres have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a new selenization strategy. The porous structure of Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C is formed by the aggregation of many small particles (20&#8211;40&#8197;nm), which are not tightly packed together, but are interspersed with gaps. Moreover, the surfaces of these small particles are covered with a thin carbon layer. Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C delivers superior rate performance (314.0&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultra&#8208;long cycle life (316.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 8000&#8197;cycles), and excellent full&#8208;cell performance (208.3&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 70&#8197;cycles) when used as an anode material for half/full sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The Na storage mechanism and kinetics have been confirmed by ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, assessment of capacitance performance, and a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). GITT shows that Na+ diffusion in the electrode material is a dynamic change process, which is associated with a phase transition during charge and discharge. The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that the porous Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C nanospheres have great potential to serve as an electrode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

The direction of hole transfer (unpaired spin) in the DNA&#8208;component, occurring between base and modified phosphate, is depicted in the cover artwork. This process critically determines the DNA&#8208;backbone damage. In one&#8208;electron oxidized phosphorodithioate nucleotide, the hole is initially localized on guanine base as a cation radical (Gua.+).

      <title>Tuning the Triplet Excited State of Bis(dipyrrin) Zinc(II) Complexes: Symmetry Breaking Charge Transfer Architecture with Exceptionally Long Lived Triplet State for Upconversion</title>
      <dc:description>Zinc(II) bis(dipyrrin) complexes, which feature intense visible absorption and efficient symmetry breaking charge transfer (SBCT) are outstanding candidates for photovoltaics but their short lived triplet states limit applications in several areas. Herein we demonstrate that triplet excited state dynamics of bis(dipyrrin) complexes can be efficiently tuned by attaching electron donating aryl moieties at the 5,5'&#8208;position of the complexes. For the first time, a long lived triplet excited state (&#964; T = 296 &#181;s) along with efficient ISC ability (&#934; &#8710; = 71%) was observed for zinc(II) bis(dipyrrin) complexes, formed via SBCT process. The results revealed that molecular geometry and energy gap between CT state and triplet energy levels strongly controls the triplet excited state properties of the complexes. An efficient triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion system was devised for the first time using SBCT architecture as triplet photosensitizer, reaching a high upconversion quantum yield of 6.2%. Our findings provide a blueprint for the development of triplet photosensitizers based on earth abundant metal complexes with long lived triplet state for revolutionary photochemical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis and Antimycobacterial Activity of Ohmyungsamycin A, Deoxyecumicin, and Ecumicin</title>
      <dc:description>The ohmyungsamycin and ecumicin natural product families are structurally related cyclic depsipeptides that display potent antimycobacterial activity. Herein the total synthesis of ohmyungsamycin A, deoxyecumicin, and ecumicin are reported, together with the first direct biological comparison of members of these natural product families against  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)  , the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB).

The synthetic natural products possessed potent antimycobacterial activity against  Mtb  with MIC  90  &#8217;s ranging from 110&#8208;360 nM and retained activity against  Mtb  in  Mtb  &#8208;infected macrophages.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chiral secondary alkylcopper reagents were prepared from the corresponding alkyl iodides with retention of configuration via an I/Li&#8208;exchange using  t  &#8208;BuLi (&#8211;100 &#176;C, 1 min) followed by a transmetalation with CuBr&#183;P(OEt)  3  (&#8211;100 &#176;C, 20 s). These stereodefined secondary alkylcoppers underwent stereoretentive cross&#8208;couplings with several 3&#8208;iodo or 3&#8208;bromo unsaturated carbonyl derivatives leading to the corresponding &#947;&#8208;methylated Michael acceptors in good yields and with high diastereoselectivities (dr up to 96:4). The method was extended to enantiomerically enriched alkylcoppers, providing optically enriched advanced natural product intermediates with up to 90%  ee  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A &#8216;Thermodynamically Stable&#8217; 2D Ni&#8208;MOF over a Wide pH Range with Scalable Preparation for Efficient C2s over C1 Hydrocarbon Separations</title>
      <dc:description>Design and construction of &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOFs surviving in liquid water, boiling water, acidic/basic solutions over a wide pH range is highly desirable for many practical applications especially adsorption based gas separations with obvious scalable preparations. Herein, we have designed a new thermodynamically stable Ni&#8208;MOF, {[Ni(L)(1,4&#8208;NDC)(H  2  O)  2  ]}  n  , IITKGP&#8208;20 displaying moderate porosity with 218 m  2  g  &#8208;1  BET surface area and micropores along [1 0 &#8208;1]  direction. As an alternate to cost intensive cryogenic high pressure distillation process for the separation of hydrocarbons, recently MOFs have shown the promise of such separation. Thus, towards application standpoint, this MOF exhibits relatively higher uptake of C  2  s hydrocarbons over the C  1  hydrocarbon at ambient conditions with one of the highest selectivities based on IAST method. Combination of two strategies (presence of stronger metal&#8208;N coordination on the spacer and the hydrophobicity on the aromatic moiety of the organic ligand) possibly makes the framework highly robust even stable in boiling water and over a wide range of pH 2&#8208;10 and representing the first example of &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOF displaying 2D structural network. Moreover, this material is easily scalable by refluxing the reaction mixture overnight. Because, such separations are performed in presence of water vapor and acidic gases, there is a great need to explore &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOFs retaining not only the structural integrity but also the porosity of frameworks.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Exceptional Substrate Diversity in Oxygenation Reactions Catalyzed by a Bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) Copper Complex</title>
      <dc:description>
The tyrosinase&#8208;like activity of a new bioinspired bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper(III) catalyst was investigated herein. The hybrid guanidine&#8208;stabilized catalyst revealed a remarkable oxygenation activity on diverse phenolic substrate classes, products of which were consistently predicted by DFT calculations. The selective C&#8722;H activation of mono&#8208; and bicyclic substrates provides a new benchmark to future developments on tyrosinase model systems on the route to atom&#8208;economic oxygen&#8208;transfer reactions.

The hybrid guanidine&#8208;stabilized catalyst revealed a remarkable oxygenation activity on diverse phenolic substrate classes, products of which were consistently predicted by DFT calculations. The selective C&#8722;H activation of mono&#8208; and bicyclic substrates provides a new benchmark to future developments on tyrosinase model systems on the route to atom&#8208;economic oxygen&#8208;transfer reactions.

      <title>Synthesis of a Molecule with Five Different Adjacent Pnictogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Power of 5! A molecular compound with all five pnictogen atoms and exclusively tertiary butyl substituents was obtained by a planned multi&#8208;step synthesis (see figure).







Abstract
The first molecular compound with all five pnictogens was obtained by a multi&#8208;step reaction. Lithiation of the (bisamido)diazadiarsetidine (tBuNAs)2(tBuNH)2 in aliphatic solvents leads to the dimeric metallated species [(tBuNAs)2(tBuNLi)2]2 (12). Upon reactions with AsCl3, SbCl3 and BiCl3 the polycyclic compounds [(tBuNAs)2(tBuN)2]PnCl (Pn=As (2), Sb (3), Bi (4)) can be obtained. Conversion of 2&#8211;4 with [tBu2SbP(tBu)Li(OEt2)]2 leads to the remarkable interpnictogens [(tBuNAs)2(tBuN)2]PnP(tBu)SbtBu2 (Pn=As (5), Sb (6), Bi (7)), whereby 7 is the first example of a molecule containing all five Group&#8197;15 elements. The compound with adjacent AsNBiPSb&#8208;chains is surprisingly stable and does not show high sensibility against light as the labile Bi&#8722;P bond might suggest.

      <title>JoyaPhos: An Atropisomeric Teraryl Monophosphine Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
JoyaPhos: A new atropisomeric monophosphine (JoyaPhos) was prepared by the sequential de novo introduction of aromatic units, resulting in a configurationally stable teraryl structure with a well&#8208;defined topology. The ligand scaffold differs from canonical binaphthyl structures and can accommodate transition metals in a dense ligand sphere, suitable for stereoselective transformations.







Abstract
A topologically well&#8208;defined atropisomeric teraryl monophosphine ligand system, prepared by a highly stereoselective arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation combined with a direct ester&#8208;to&#8208;anthracene transformation, is described herein. The ligands were evaluated for gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloisomerization reactions as well as a unique intramolecular Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling for the atroposelective synthesis of a N&#8208;aryl&#8208;indoline bearing a C&#8722;N stereogenic axis. The ligand structure induced up to 95:5 stereoselectivity in the asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction and features an interesting dynamic behavior as observed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies.

      <title>PAINT&#8208;ing Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;Diphenylalanine Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Key aspects of hydrogels like fiber diameter, network morphology and mesh size are sub&#8208;diffraction limited features and cannot be visualized effectively using confocal microscopy. In this work, we show that it is possible to image fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected diphenylalanine (FmocFF) hydrogels by points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) in native conditions and without direct gel labelling (see figure).







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected diphenylalanine (FmocFF) in water is widely known to produce hydrogels. Typically, confocal microscopy is used to visualize such hydrogels under wet conditions, that is, without freezing or drying. However, key aspects of hydrogels like fiber diameter, network morphology and mesh size are sub&#8208;diffraction limited features and cannot be visualized effectively using this approach. In this work, we show that it is possible to image FmocFF hydrogels by Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT) in native conditions and without direct gel labelling. We demonstrate that the fiber network can be visualized with improved resolution (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) both in 2D and 3D. Quantitative information is extracted such as mesh size and fiber diameter. This method can complement the existing characterization tools for hydrogels and provide useful information supporting the design of new materials.

      <title>Non&#8208;covalent Intermolecular Interaction in Co&#8208;facially Stacked 24&#8208;&#960; Antiaromatic Hexaphyrin Dimer</title>
      <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking is omnipresent not only in nature but in a wide variety of practical fields applied to our lives.

      <title>Dynamic Coordination Chemistry of Fluorinated Zr&#8208;MOFs: Synthetic Control and Reassembly/Disassembly beyond de novo Synthesis to Tune the Structure and Property</title>
      <dc:description>
Zr4+ metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs), known for excellent stability and functionality, meet the synthetic challenge in tuning the strength of a Zr&#8722;Ocarboxylate linkage. This work explores the unusual coordination dynamics of a family of fluorinated Zr&#8208;MOFs. The low&#8208;connecting kinetic Zr&#8208;MOFs possess dynamic behavior, thus opening a post&#8208;synthetic pathway to sequential reassembly/disassembly. The factors, such as ligand geometry, etc., have been studied. Their stability, hydrophobicity and gas adsorption/separation properties are explored. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z.&#8208;W. Wei, G. Maurin, C.&#8208;Y. Su, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001052).

Garlic, Allium Sativum, is native to Central Asia and is grown in China in extraordinary amounts, accounting for 80&#8201;% of the world's total production. Famous for its pungent odor and characteristic flavor, beneath its cloves are natural products with well&#8208;known biological properties. There is still a distinct lack of reported total syntheses of its low molecular weight natural products, which are volatile and contain reactive moieties such as disulfides. In this work, the second chemical total synthesis of ajoene, an anti&#8208;thrombotic agent, was developed in batch mode. Flow chemistry has also been developed to enable the synthesis of a novel sulfide without purification steps. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Wirth et&#8197;al.

A hydrothermal reaction taking place in a capillary while being monitored using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction from a synchrotron source is depicted in the cover image. The capillary is locally heated from above, while being penetrated by X&#8208;rays, which are diffracted in cone&#8208;like patterns by the powder within.

      <title>Chromium speciation in Zr&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for environmental remediation</title>
      <dc:description>Acute Cr  VI  water pollution due to anthropogenic activities is an increasing worldwide concern. The high toxicity and mobility of Cr  VI  makes necessary to develop dual adsorbent/ion&#8208;reductive materials that are able to capture Cr  VI  and transform it efficiently to less hazardous Cr  III  . The accurate description of the chromium speciation at the adsorbent/ion&#8208;reductive matrix is key to assess whether Cr  VI  is completely reduced to Cr  III  , or if its incomplete transformation led to the stabilization of highly reactive Cr  V  transient species within the material. With this goal in mind, a dual ultraviolet visible and electron paramagnetic spectroscopy approach has been applied to determine the Cr speciation within Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Our findings point out that the generation of defect positions at Zr&#8208;MOFs boost Cr  VI  adsorption, whilst the presence of reductive groups at the organic linkers play a key role to stabilize it as Cr  III  isolated and/or clustered ions.</dc:description>

      <title>Coordination Chemistry and Methylation of Mixed&#8208;substituted Tetraphosphetanes (RP&#8208;PtBu)2 (R = Ph, Py)</title>

Compound  5  is of special interest since the presence of two pyridyl&#8208;substituents as well as the P  4  &#8208;core allows for a rich coordination chemistry with coinage metal salts [Cu(MeCN)  4  ][OTf], Ag[OTf] and  in situ  formed [Au(tht)][OTf] (tht = tetrahydrothiophene). Both tetraphosphetanes undergo alkylation reaction with MeOTf to give a series of tetraphosphetanium and tetraphosphetanediium triflate salts with additional methylation of the pyridyl&#8208;moiety in case of  5  resulting in interesting novel cyclic trications.

      <title>Ni[B2(SO4)4] and Co[B2(SO4)4]: Unveiling systematic trends in phyllosilicate analogue borosulfates</title>
      <dc:description>Borosulfates are compounds analogous to silicates, with heteropolyanionic subunits of vertex&#8208;linked (SO  4  )&#8208; and (BO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra. In contrast to the immense structural diversity of silicates, the number of borosulfates is yet very limited and the extent of their properties is still unknown. This is particularly true for representatives with phyllosilicate and tectosilicate analogue anionic substructures. Herein, we present Ni[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ] and Co[B  2  (SO  4  )  4  ], two new borosulfates with phyllosilicate analogue topology. While the anionic subunits of both structures are homeotypic, the positions of the charge compensating cations differ significantly: Ni  II  is located between the borosulfate layers, while Co  II  in contrast is embedded within the layer. Detailed analysis of these two structures based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetochemical investigations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations, unveiled the reasons for this finding. By  in silico  comparison with other divalent borosulfates, we uncovered systematic trends for phyllosilicate analogues leading to the prediction of new species.</dc:description>

      <title>36&#8208;nuclearity Organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized polyoxomolybdates: Synthesis, Characterization and Selective catalytic oxidation of sulfides</title>
      <dc:description>The crown&#8208;shaped 36&#8208;molybdate cluster organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized polyoxomolybdates with the highest nuclearity in organophosphonate&#8208;based polyoxometalates chemistry,  (NH  4  )  19  Na  7  H  10  [Cu(H  2  O)TeMo  6  O  21  {N(CH  2  PO  3  )  3  }]  6  &#183;31H  2  O  , has been reported for the first time. The synthesized 36&#8208;molybdate cluster was characterized by routine techniques and employed as a catalyst for selective oxidation of sulfides with impressive catalytic and selective performances under heat treatment. High efficiency (TON=15333) was achieved in the selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, caused by the synergic effect between copper and polyoxomolybdates and the generation of the cuprous species during the heat treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbene&#8208;induced rescue of catalytic activity in deactivated Nitrite Reductase mutant</title>
      <dc:description>The role of His145 in the T1 copper center of Nitrite Reductase (NiR) is pivotal for the activity of the enzyme. Mutation to a glycine at this position enables the reconstitution of the T1 center by the addition of imidazole as exogenous ligands, however the catalytic activity is only marginally rescued. Here we demonstrate that the uptake of 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolylidene as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) by the H145G NiR mutant instead of imidazole yields a significantly more active catalyst, suggesting a beneficial role of such C&#8208;bonding. Spectroscopic analyses of the formed H145G~NHC variant as well as an analogue without the catalytic T2 copper center reveals no significant alteration of the T1 site compared to the wild type or the variant containing imidazole as exogenous N&#8208;bound surrogate of H145. However, the presence of the carbene doubles the catalytic activity of the mutant compared to the imidazole variant. This enhanced activity has been attributed to a faster electron transfer to the T1 center in the NHC variant and a concomitant change of the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

      <title>Activation of Ethylene by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Coordinated Magnesium(I) Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Reactions of a series of magnesium(I) compounds with ethylene, in the presence of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, have been explored. Treating [{(MesNacnac)Mg}2] (MesNacnac = [HC(MeCNMes)2]&#8208;, Mes = mesityl) with an excess of ethylene in the presence of two equivalents of:C{(MeNCMe)2} (TMC) leads to the formal reductive coupling of ethylene, and formation of the 1,2&#8208;dimagnesiobutane complex, [{(MesNacnac)(TMC)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C4H8)].

      <title>Luminescent Bimetallic Ir(III)/Au(I) Peptide Bioconjugates as Potential Theranostic Agents</title>
      <dc:description>Diverse&#160;iridium peptide bioconjugates and the iridium/gold bimetallic complexes have been synthesised starting from the Ir(III) complex [Ir(ppy)  2  (Phen&#8208;5&#8208;COO)] by solid phase peptide synthesis. The selected peptide sequences were an enkephalin derivative TyrGlyGlyPheLeu together with the propargyl&#8208;substituted species TyrGlyPglPheLeu to allow gold coordination, and a short peptide, AlaCysAlaPhen, containing a cysteine residue. Introduction of the gold centre has been achieved via a click reaction with the alkynyl group leading to an organometallic Au&#8208;C(triazole) species, or by direct coordination to the sulfur atom of the cysteine. The photophysical properties of these species revealed predominantly an emission originated from the Ir complex, using mixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states of triplet multiplicity. The formation of the peptide bioconjugates caused a systematic red&#8208;shift of the emission profiles. Lysosomal accumulation was observed for all the complexes, in contrast to the expected mitochondrial accumulation triggered by the gold complexes. Only the cysteine&#8208;containing Ir/Au bioconjugate displayed cytotoxic activity. The absence of activity may be related to the lack of endosomal / lysosomal escape for the cationic peptide conjugates. Interestingly, the different coordination sphere of the gold atom may play a crucial role, as the Au&#8208;S(cysteine) bond may be more readily cleaved in a biological environment than the Au&#8208;C(triazole) bond, and thus the Au fragment could be released from or trapped in the lysosomes, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>A Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;inserted Diphenoquinone: Synthesis, Structure and Dynamic Redox Property</title>
      <dc:description>We synthesized a novel tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivative substituted with two phenoxy radicals on one 1,3&#8208;dithiole ring, which may have either open&#8208;shell diradical or closed&#8208;shell extended&#8208;quinoidal ground states. X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis and NMR measurements proved that this molecule has a closed&#8208;shell extended quinoidal structure both in the solid state and in solution. DFT calculations showed the donor&#8211;acceptor type electronic properties of this molecule with well&#8208;separated HOMO&#8211;LUMO distribution and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Because of this donor&#8211;acceptor type character, this molecule gave both the dication and the dianion species by electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Furthermore, during the redox process between the neutral and the dication states, this molecule exhibited unique changes in the cyclic voltammogram by repeating the cycles or varying the scan rate. The observed electrochemical behavior was explained by the conformational changes of the electrochemically generated species, and thus indicating that this molecule is classified as a dynamic redox system.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a novel tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivative substituted with two phenoxy radicals on one 1,3&#8208;dithiole ring, which may have either open&#8208;shell diradical or closed&#8208;shell extended&#8208;quinoidal ground states. X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis and NMR measurements proved that this molecule has a closed&#8208;shell extended quinoidal structure both in the solid state and in solution. DFT calculations showed the donor&#8211;acceptor type electronic properties of this molecule with well&#8208;separated HOMO&#8211;LUMO distribution and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Because of this donor&#8211;acceptor type character, this molecule gave both the dication and the dianion species by electrochemical oxidation and reduction. Furthermore, during the redox process between the neutral and the dication states, this molecule exhibited unique changes in the cyclic voltammogram by repeating the cycles or varying the scan rate. The observed electrochemical behavior was explained by the conformational changes of the electrochemically generated species, and thus indicating that this molecule is classified as a dynamic redox system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Recent progresses in aminoglycoside conjugation for RNA targeting: antimicrobials and beyond</title>
      <dc:description>Natural aminoglycosides are therapeutically useful antibiotics as well as very efficient RNA ligands. They are oligosaccharides containing several ammonium groups able to interfere with the translation process in prokaryotes upon binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) thus impairing protein synthesis. Even if aminoglycosides are commonly used in therapy, these RNA binders lack selectivity, being able to bind to a wide number of RNA sequences/structures. This is one of the reasons for their toxicity and limited applications in therapy. At the same time, the ability of aminoglycosides to bind to various RNAs renders them a great source of inspiration for the synthesis of new binders with improved affinity and specificity toward several therapeutically relevant RNA targets. Thus, a number of studies have been performed on these complex and highly functionalized compounds leading to the development of various synthetic methodologies toward the synthesis of conjugated aminoglycosides. The aim of this review is to highlight recent progresses in the field of aminoglycoside conjugation paying particular attention to the modifications performed toward the improvement of affinity and especially to the selectivity of the resulting compounds. This will help readers understand how to introduce a desired chemical modification for future developments of RNA ligands as antibiotics, antiviral and anticancer compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>The Thioredoxin System: A Promising Target for Cancer Drug Development</title>
      <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;cancer drugs endeavors: Thioredoxin system, composed of thioredoxin (TRX), thioredoxin reductase (TR), and NADPH, plays critical roles in many cellular functions. However, it is also overexpressed in many solid tumor cancers. Thus, many inhibitors have been developed to target TR and TRX, such as, natural products, ebselen analogues, metal complexes, and small molecules. We foresee great potential for future efforts towards developing new inhibitors for this system, including protein and peptide&#8208;based inhibitors, as new anti&#8208;cancer drugs.







Abstract
The thioredoxin system is highly conserved system found in all living cells and comprises NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase. This system plays a critical role in preserving a reduced intracellular environment, and its involvement in regulating a wide range of cellular functions makes it especially vital to cellular homeostasis. Its critical role is not limited to healthy cells, it is also involved in cancer development, and is overexpressed in many cancers. This makes the thioredoxin system a promising target for cancer drug development. As such, over the last decade, many inhibitors have been developed that target the thioredoxin system, most of which are small molecules targeting the thioredoxin reductase C&#8208;terminal redox center. A few inhibitors of thioredoxin have also been developed. We believe that more efforts should be invested in developing protein/peptide&#8208;based inhibitors against both thioredoxin reductase and/or thioredoxin.

      <title>Metallic Glass Films with Nanostructured Periodic Density Fluctuations Supported on Si/SiO2 as an Efficient Hydrogen Sorber</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured (&#8764;50&#8197;nm) Pd&#8208;Au&#8208;Si based metallic glass films (NMGF) on Si/SiO2 have been synthesized as an efficient hydrogen sorber. A significant number of nanovoids originated from PdHx crystals, and an increase in average interatomic spacing is detected in Pd&#8208;Au&#8208;Si NMGF by high&#8208;resolution TEM linked to the unique density fluctuations. This production and characterization methodology allows for the development of metallic glasses with maximum hydrogen uptake via controllable nanovoid formation.

      <title>Catalytic enantioselective synthesis of heterocyclic vicinal fluoroamines using asymmetric protonation: A method development and mechanistic study</title>
      <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective synthesis of heterocyclic vicinal fluoroamines is reported. A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid promotes aza&#8208;Michael addition to fluoroalkenyl heterocycles to give a prochiral enamine intermediate, which undergoes asymmetric protonation upon rearomatization. The reaction accommodates a range of azaheterocycles and nucleophiles, generating the C&#8211;F stereocenter in high enantioselectivity, and is also amenable to stereogenic C&#8211;CF  3  bonds. Extensive DFT calculations provide evidence for a stereocontrolled proton transfer from the catalyst to substrate as the rate determining step, and show the importance of steric interactions from the catalyst alkyl groups in enforcing high enantioselectivity. Crystal structure data shows the dominance of non&#8208;covalent interactions in the core structure conformation, enabling modulation of the conformational landscape.

      <dc:description>2&#8208;Naphthol derivative  2  corresponding to the aromatic ring moiety of neocarzinostatin chromophore was found to degrade proteins under photo&#8208;irradiation with long&#8208;wavelength UV light without any additives under neutral conditions.

However, release of  2  from  8  by reaction with H&#8322;O&#8322;&#160;regenerated the photodegrading ability.

Furthermore, a purpose&#8208;designed synthetic tumor&#8208;related biomarker, H&#8322;O&#8322;&#8208;activatable photosensitizer  8  possessing a H&#8322;O&#8322;&#8208;responsive arylboronic ester moiety conjugated to the hydroxyl group at the C2 position of  2  , showed significantly lower photodegrading ability compared to  2  . However, release of  2  from  8  by reaction with H&#8322;O&#8322;&#160;regenerated the photodegrading ability. Compound  8  exhibited selective photo&#8208;cytotoxicity against high H&#8322;O&#8322;&#8208;expressing cancer cells upon irradiation with long&#8208;wavelength UV light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>First total syntheses of novel non&#8208;enzymatic polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites and their identification in edible oils</title>
      <dc:description>Oxidative stress (OS) is an in&#8208;vivo process leading to free radical overproduction, which triggers polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation resulting in the formation of racemic non&#8208;enzymatic oxygenated metabolites.

Three new PUFA&#8208;metabolites, namely 18&#8208;F  3t  &#8208;Isoprostane (IsoP) from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 20&#8209;F  4t  &#8209;Neuroprostane (NeuroP) from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 20&#8208;F  3t  &#8208;NeuroP from docosapentaenoic acid (DPA  n&#8208;3  ) were synthesized by two complementary synthetic strategies. The first one relied on a racemic approach to 18(  RS  )&#8208;18&#8208;F  3t  &#8208;IsoP using an oxidative radical anion cyclization as a key step, whereas the second used an enzymatic deracemization of a bicyclo[3.3.0]octene intermediate obtained from cyclooctadiene to pursue an asymmetric synthesis.

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cascade C&#8208;H Activation/Annulation Processes for the Synthesis of Polycycles</title>
      <dc:description>Polycycles are abundantly present in numerous advanced chemicals, functional materials, bioactive molecules and natural products. However, the strategies for the synthesis of polycycles are limited to classical reactions and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, requiring prefunctionalized starting materials and lengthy synthetic operations. The emergence of novel approaches shows great promise for the fields of organic/medicinal/material chemistry. Among them, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation followed by intermolecular annulation reactions prevail, due to their straightforward manner with high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy, providing rapid, concise and efficient methods for the construction of diverse polycycles. Several strategies have been developed for the synthesis of polycycles, relying on sequential multiple C&#8208;H activation/annulation, or combination of C&#8208;H activation/annulation and further interaction with a proximal group, or merger of C&#8208;H activation with a cycloaddition reaction, or  in situ  formation of the directing group. These are attractive, efficient, step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economic methods starting from commercially available materials. This review will provide an introduction to transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation for the synthesis of polycycles, helping researchers to discover indirect connections and reveal hidden opportunities. It will also promote the discovery of novel synthetic strategies relying on C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

      <title>Dipolar Nanocars Based on a Porphyrin Backbone</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a new family of nanocars is reported. To control their motion, we integrated a dipole which can be tuned thanks to strategic donor and acceptor substituents at the 5&#8208; and 15&#8208;positions of the porphyrin backbone. The two other meso positions are substituted with ethynyltriptycene moieties which are known to act as wheels. Full characterization of nine nanocars is presented as well as the electrochemistry of these push&#8208;pull molecules. DFT calculations allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the dipoles and to understand the electrochemical behavior and how it is affected by the electron donating and accepting groups present.

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Metaphosphorous Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Metaphosphorous acid (HOPO), a heavy analogue of nitrous acid (HONO), has been generated in syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformations in the gas phase. Surprisingly, anti&#8208;HOPO is highly unstable and it undergoes rapid rotamerization to syn&#8208;HOPO via hydrogen&#8208;atom tunneling (HAT) with a lifetime of 10&#8197;min in N2&#8208;matrix at 2.8&#8197;K.

      <title>Transformation of COUPY fluorophores into a novel class of visible light&#8208;cleavable photolabile protecting groups</title>
      <dc:description>Although photolabile protecting groups (PPGs) have found widespread applications in several fields of chemistry, biology and materials science, there is a growing interest in expanding the photochemical toolbox to overcome some of the limitations of classical caging groups. In this work, the synthesis of a new class of visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive PPGs based on low&#8208;molecular weight COUPY fluorophores with several attractive properties, including long&#8208;wavelength absorption, is reported. Besides being stable to spontaneous hydrolysis in the dark, COUPY&#8208;based PPGs can be efficiently photoactivated with yellow (560 nm) and red light (620 nm) under physicological&#8208;like conditions, thereby offering the possibility of unmasking functional groups from COUPY photocages under irradiation conditions in which other PPGs remain stable. Additionally, COUPY photocages exhibit excellent cellular uptake and accumulate selectively in mitochondria, opening the door to delivering caged analogues of biologically active compounds into this organelle.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical and Spectroscopic Study of Eu(III) and Eu(II) coordination in the 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide Ionic Liquid</title>
      <dc:description>Separation processes based on room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL) and electro&#8208;chemical refining are promising strategies for the recovery of lanthanides from primary ores and electronic waste. However, they require the speciation of dissolved elements to be known with accuracy. In the present study, Eu coordination and Eu(III)/Eu(II) electrochemical behavior as a function of water content in 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIm][NTf  2  ]) was investigated using UV&#8208;visible spectrophotometry, time&#8208;resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy.  In situ  measurements were performed in spectro&#8208;electrochemical cells. Under anhydrous conditions, Eu(III) and Eu(II) were complexed by NTf  2  , forming Eu&#8208;O and Eu&#8208;(N,O) bonds with the anion sulfoxide function and N atoms, respectively. This complexation resulted in a greater stability of Eu(II), and in quasi&#8208;reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction with an E  0  &#8217;  potential of 0.18 V  vs  the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc  +  /Fc) couple. Upon increasing water content, progressive incorporation of water in the Eu(III) coordination sphere occurred. This led to reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions, but also to a decrease in stability of the +II oxidation state (E  0  &#8217;  = &#8208;0.45 V  vs  Fc  +  /Fc in RTIL containing 1300 mM water).</dc:description>

      <title>The Relevance of Size Matching in Self&#8208;assembly: Impact in Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Cocrystallizations</title>
      <dc:description>Decamethonium diiodide is reported to perform the chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective encapsulation of para&#8208;dihalobenzenes via competitive formation of halogen bonded cocrystals starting from solutions containing also ortho&#160;and meta&#160;isomers. Selective caging in the solid occurs even when excess ortho&#160;and meta&#160;isomers, or a mixture of them, are present in solution. A prime matching between the size and shape of the dication and the formed dianions plays a key&#8208;role in enabling for the selective self&#8208;assembly, as proven by successful encapsulation of halogen bond donors as weak as 1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene and by the results of cocrystallization trials involving mismatching tectons. Encapsulated para&#8208;dihalobenzenes&#160;guest molecules can be removed quantitatively by heating the cocrystals under reduced pressure and be recovered as pure materials.

      <title>Precise Macroscopic Supramolecular Assembly: Strategies and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA) is a new concept in supramolecular science with focus on interfacial assembly of macroscopic building blocks, which has largely extended the applicable materials of supramolecular assembly and provided new solutions to fabricating tissue scaffolds, soft devices etc. The precision of assembled structures is widely concerned; unlike molecular assemblies, the MSA precision is highly dependent on the matching degree of assembled surfaces because of the large interactive area and group number, which resulted in remarkably increased kinetic possibility and metastable assemblies. This Concept introduces the principle, history and development of MSA, elaborates the low&#8208;precision challenge in MSA, summaries strategies of precise MSA based on different thermodynamic stability of precise/imprecise structures and control over assembly kinetics, and finally demonstrates applications of precise MSA structures in advanced manufacture such as tissue scaffolds.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a Host Material for Sulfur to Alleviate the Shuttle Effect of Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroelectric has an excellent reversible polarization conversion behavior under external electric field. Herein, we propose an interesting strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery by utilizing ferroelectric metal&#8208;organic framework (FMOF) as a host material for the first time. Compared to other MOF with same structure but without ferroelectricity and commercial carbon black, the cathode based on FMOF exhibits a low capacity decay and high cycling stability. These results demonstrate that the polarization switching behaviors of FMOF under the discharge voltage of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery can effectively trap polysulfides by polar&#8211;polar interactions, decrease polysulfides shuttle and improve the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery.</dc:description>

      <title>Boron&#8208;Containing Lipids and Liposomes: New Conjugates of Cholesterol with Polyhedral Boron Hydrides</title>
      <dc:description>A series of boron&#8208;containing lipids were prepared by reactions of cyclic oxonium derivatives of polyhedron boranes and metallacarboranes (  closo&#8208;  dodecaborate anion, cobalt and iron bis(dicarbollides)) with amine and carboxylic acids which are derived from cholesterol.

The resulting liposomal formulations showed moderate to excellent loading and entrapment efficiency, thus justifying the design of the compounds to fit in the lipid bilayer and ensuring ease of  in vivo  use for future application. The liposome formulations based on cobalt and iron bis(dicarbollide)&#8208;based lipids were found to be non&#8208;toxic against both human breast normal epithelial cells MCF&#8208;10A and human breast cancer cells MCF&#8208;7.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>MOF&#8208;driven synthesis is considered as a promising alternative for the development of new catalytic materials with well&#8208;designed active sites. This synthetic approach is used here to gradually transform a new bimetallic MOF, composed of Pd and Fe as metal components, via the  in situ  generation of aniline under mild conditions. This methodology results in a compositionally homogeneous nanocomposite formed by Fe&#8208;doped Pd nanoparticles and these, in turn, supported on an iron oxide&#8208;doped carbon. The nanocomposite has been fully characterized by several techniques such as IR, Raman, TEM, XPS, XAS, among others.

      <title>Modulating Hierarchical Micro/Mesoporosity by a Mixed Solvent Approach in Al&#8208;MOF: Stabilization of MAPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Various hierarchical micro/mesoporous MOFs based on {[Al(&#181;&#8208;OH)(1,4&#8208;NDC)]&#8226;H  2  O} (  MOF1  ) with tunable porosities (pore volume and surface area) have been synthesized by assembling Al(III) and 1,4&#8208;NDC (1,4&#8208;Naphthalenedicarboxylate) under microwave irradiation by varying ethanol/water solvent ratio. Water/ethanol mixture has played a crucial role in the mesopore generation in  MOF1M  25  , MOF1M  50  ,  and  MOF1M  75  , which is achieved by  in situ  formation of water/ethanol clusters. By adjusting the ratio of water&#8208;ethanol, the particle size, surface area and micro/mesopore volume fraction of the MOFs are controlled. Furthermore, reaction time also plays a critical role in mesopore formation as realized by varying reaction time for the MOF with 50% ethanol (  MOF1M  50  ). Additionally, hierarchical MOF (  MOF1M  50  ) has been used as a template for the stabilization of MAPbBr  3  (MA = methylammonium) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs). MAPbBr  3  PQDs are grown inside  MOF1M  50  , where mesopores control the size of PQDs which leads to quantum confinement.</dc:description>

      <title>Homo&#8208; and heterodinuclear arene&#8208;linked osmium(II) and ruthenium(II) organometallics: probing the impact of metal variation on reactivity and biological activity</title>
      <dc:description>Dinuclear metallodrugs offer much potential in the development of novel anticancer chemotherapeutics as a result of the distinct interactions possible with biomacromolecular targets and the unique biological activity that can result. Here, we describe the development of isostructural homodinuclear Os(II)&#8208;Os(II) and heterodinuclear Os(II)&#8208;Ru(II) organometallic complexes formed from the linking of the arene ligands of [M(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(C2O4)(PTA)] (M = Os/Ru; PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) units. Together with the known Ru(II)&#8208;Ru(II) analogue, a chromatin&#8208;modifying agent, we probed the impact of variation of the metal ions on the structure, reactivity and biological activity of these complexes. The complexes have been structurally characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, their stability and reactivity examined using  1H and  31P NMR spectroscopy and biological activity assessed, alongside mononuclear analogues, through MTT assays and cell cycle analysis (HT&#8208;29 cell line). Results revealed high antiproliferative activity in each case with cell cycle profiles of the dinuclear complexes found to be similar to that for untreated cells, and similar but distinct profiles for the mononuclear complexes. These results indicate these complexes impact on cell viability predominantly through a non&#8208;DNA damaging mechanism of action. The new Os(II)&#8208;Os(II and Os(II)&#8208;Ru(II) complexes reported here are further examples of a family of compounds operating via mechanism(s) of action atypical of the majority of metallodrugs, and which have potential as tools in chromatin research.</dc:description>

      <title>Polypyridyl&#8208;Based Copper Phenanthrene Complexes: Combining Stability with Enhanced DNA Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>We report a series of copper(II) artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) and demonstrate their DNA damaging properties and in vitro cytotoxicity against human&#8208;derived pancreatic cancer cells. The compounds combine a tris&#8208;chelating polypyridyl ligand,  di  &#8208;(2&#8208;pycolyl)amine (DPA), and a DNA intercalating phenanthrene unit. Their general formula is Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;N,N&#180; (where N,N&#180; = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), dipyridoquinoxaline (DPQ) or dipyridophenazine (DPPZ)). Characterisation was achieved by X&#8208;ray crystallography and continuous&#8208;wave EPR (cw&#8208;EPR), hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) and Davies electron&#8211;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies. The presence of the DPA ligand enhances solution stability and facilitates enhanced DNA recognition with apparent binding constants (  K  app  ) rising from 10  5  to 10  7  M  &#8208;1  with increasing extent of planar phenanthrene. Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ, the complex with greatest DNA binding and intercalation effects, recognises the minor groove of guanine&#8208;cytosine (G&#8208;C) rich sequences. Oxidative DNA damage also occurs in the minor groove and can be inhibited by superoxide and hydroxyl radical trapping agents. The complexes, particularly Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ, display promising anticancer activity against human pancreatic tumour cells with in vitro results surpassing the clinical platinum(II) drug oxaliplatin.</dc:description>

Their general formula is Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;N,N&#180; (where N,N&#180; = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), dipyridoquinoxaline (DPQ) or dipyridophenazine (DPPZ)). Characterisation was achieved by X&#8208;ray crystallography and continuous&#8208;wave EPR (cw&#8208;EPR), hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) and Davies electron&#8211;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies. The presence of the DPA ligand enhances solution stability and facilitates enhanced DNA recognition with apparent binding constants (  K  app  ) rising from 10  5  to 10  7  M  &#8208;1  with increasing extent of planar phenanthrene. Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ, the complex with greatest DNA binding and intercalation effects, recognises the minor groove of guanine&#8208;cytosine (G&#8208;C) rich sequences. Oxidative DNA damage also occurs in the minor groove and can be inhibited by superoxide and hydroxyl radical trapping agents. The complexes, particularly Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ, display promising anticancer activity against human pancreatic tumour cells with in vitro results surpassing the clinical platinum(II) drug oxaliplatin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Probing the origin of adaptive aromaticity in 16&#8208;valence&#8208;electron metallapentalenes</title>
      <dc:description>Species with adaptive aromaticity are aromatic in the ground and lowest&#8208;lying triplet excited states and they have normally intermediate singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Few examples of compounds with adaptive aromaticity are known to date, including 16&#8208;valence&#8208;electron (16e) metallapentalenes. A sweeping search could be conducted to discover new members of this group, but efficient designs with an explicit strategy would facilitate the quest for new members of this elusive family. Density functional theory calculations and aromaticity evaluations have been performed to reveal the nature of triplet&#8208;state aromaticity in 16e metallapentalenes. Our results show that coordination of strong &#963;&#8208; or &#960;&#8208;donor ligands helps achieving adaptive aromaticity of 16e metallapentalenes by means of a spin delocalization mechanism. These results have important implications for understanding the unusual properties of the organometallic adaptive aromatics, leading the way to efficient design of new compounds with tunable singlet&#8208;triplet gaps.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct synthesis of peptide&#8208;containing silicone. A new way for bioactive materials</title>
      <dc:description>A simple and efficient way to synthesize peptide&#8208;containing silicone materials is described. Silicone oils containing a chosen ratio of bioactive peptide sequences were prepared by acid&#8208;catalyzed co&#8208;polymerization of dichlorodimethylsilane, hybrid dichloromethyl peptidosilane and either Si&#8208;vinyl or Si&#8208;H functionalized monomers. Functionalized silicone oils were first obtained and then after hydrosilylation cross&#8208;linking, bioactive PDMS based materials were straightforward obtained. The introduction of an antibacterial peptide yields PDMS materials showing an interesting activity against Staphylococcus Aureus. In the same way, RGD ligands&#8208;containing PDMS demonstrated improved cell adhesion properties. This generic method was fully compatible with the stability of peptides and thus opened the way to the synthesis of a wide range of biologically active silicones</dc:description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Benzyl Alcohols/Methyl Arenes to Aryl Nitriles via H&#8208;Abstraction by Azide Radical</title>
      <dc:description>This report presents the visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted synthesis of aryl nitriles from easily accessible alcohols or methyl arenes in the presence of O2. Organic photoredox catalyst, 4CzIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene), induces single electron transfer (SET) from azide N3&#8722; and generates azide radical N3&#8226;. The photogenerated N3&#8226; abstracts H atom from &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond of benzylic system, which provides aldehyde and hydrazoic acid (HN3) in situ. This reaction subsequently forms azido alcohol intermediate that transforms into nitrile with the assistance of triflic acid (Br&#248;nsted acid). A range of alcohols and methyl arenes successfully underwent cyanation at room temperature with good to excellent yields and showed good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>
