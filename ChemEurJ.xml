         <title>Bioorthogonal Chemistry in Biomolecule Quantification: A Review of Reactions and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the application of catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole cysteine condensation in the semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative analysis of biomolecules. These reactions offer fast kinetics, high selectivity, and good biocompatibility, enabling diverse detection strategies for accurate biomolecule quantification.








ABSTRACT
Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a transformative strategy for detecting and quantifying biomolecules in complex biological systems. This review highlights recent advances in catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions specifically applied to semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative biomolecular analysis. We exclude reactions that require toxic or complex catalysts and focus on four reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole&#8211;cysteine condensation. For each, we discuss reaction kinetics and strategies for representative applications in biomolecular quantification. The scope of target biomolecules varies by reaction, including proteins, nucleic acids, glycans, and small molecules. Quantification techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are examined, with reported limits of detection typically ranging from nanomolar to micromolar, and a few advanced techniques reaching femtomolar or attomolar sensitivity. Each reaction is discussed in terms of kinetics, molecular compatibility, and analytical sensitivity. Finally, we outline key challenges and future opportunities, emphasizing the need for faster reaction kinetics, improved probe design, enhanced integration with advanced analytical platforms, and standardized methods to improve reproducibility and cross&#8208;study comparability in biomolecular quantification.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Based Chiral Macrocycles and Molecular Cages: Synthetic Strategies, Chiroptical Modulation, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides a concise overview of recent progress in the design and synthesis of helicene&#8208;based covalent and coordination macrocycles and cages, focusing on advances in synthetic strategies, modulation of chiroptical properties, and emerging opportunities in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles and molecular cages possess enzyme&#8208;like cavities whose size, shape, and functionality can be precisely engineered.&#160;Helicenes, characterized by rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones and inherent helical chirality, serve as exceptional scaffolds for constructing highly distorted chiral macrocycles and cages.&#160;These supramolecular architectures demonstrate enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), enantioselective recognition, and efficient guest adsorption.&#160;This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in helicene&#8208;based coordination and covalent strategies, highlighting synthetic methodologies, chiroptical modulation, and emerging applications.&#160;Key challenges&#8212;including fluorescence quenching in metallacages, synthetic complexity, and limited structural diversity&#8212;are critically discussed. We also highlight potential opportunities involving high&#8208;emission linkages, dynamic covalent strategies, and stimuli&#8208;responsive designs.&#160;Collectively, these insights establish a framework for the rational design of helicene&#8208;derived macrocycles and three&#8208;dimensional cages, paving the way toward the development of advanced chiral functional materials.

         <title>Design of Uniform Polymer Nanoparticles via Living Crystallization Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components.








ABSTRACT
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles over the dimensions and structure, which enables the fabrication of 1D cylinders and 2D platelets with low dispersity. This versatile and robust approach, characterized by linearly tunable dimensions and programmability of structural sequences, has been widely applied in the construction of nanoparticles exhibiting uniform size and controlled architecture. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components. Building upon this foundation, we elucidate the key aspects of living CDSA seed growth, with a particular emphasis on exploring the mechanism of governing heteroepitaxial growth from crystalline seeds with distinctly chemical compositions. Elucidating the intricate mechanisms of heteroepitaxial crystallization allows access to broaden the design possibilities for segmented nanoparticles with spatially defined core compositions and functionalities. Moreover, the new developing methods for facile synthesis of uniform particles with high solid concentrations are also reviewed, which are promising for the real applications of these advanced nanomaterials.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chemical Systems That Mimic Biological Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemists are designing synthetic systems that mimic life's dynamic behaviors, such as motion, sensing, adaptation, and compartmentalization, by integrating reaction networks with stimuli like light, pH, and chemical fuels. This mini&#8208;review surveys molecular machines, responsive materials, nucleic acid networks, and artificial cells, highlighting how chemical design drives the emergence of life&#8208;like functions.








ABSTRACT
Living systems achieve adaptability, motion, and self&#8208;regulation through chemical networks operating out of equilibrium. Reproducing these dynamics synthetically demands precise control over kinetics, thermodynamics, and molecular design to convert energy inputs into time&#8208;programmed function. Recent advances in stimuli&#8208;responsive and chemically powered systems show how life&#8208;like behaviors such as oscillations, autonomous motion, adaptive responses, and compartmentalization can be encoded using fuel&#8208;driven cycles and stimulus&#8208;gated switches powered by chemical, photonic, or enzymatic inputs. This mini&#8208;review highlights molecular assemblies that sustain transient states, molecular machines powered by specific chemical inputs, responsive materials that reconfigure in response to environmental triggers, nucleic acid&#8208;based networks for sensing and regulation, and artificial cells that exhibit compartmentalization and signaling. Together, these developments bridge systems chemistry and biomimicry, expanding the chemical toolkit for engineering matter that can adapt and respond. Beyond mimicking biology, such systems deepen our understanding of the molecular foundations of living matter and open new routes to technology. Self&#8208;powered systems, molecular motors, smart materials, and artificial cells now form a rapidly growing toolbox with the potential to impact drug discovery, biosensing, energy, food production, and materials science. The field's future lies in integrating multiple life&#8208;essential functions into a single construct, ultimately enabling synthetic systems that replicate the complex network behaviors of living organisms and inspire next&#8208;generation innovation.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Photocatalysts for Sustainable Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs are an emerging class of porous materials that exhibit excellent photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties. Photocatalytic sustainable ammonia synthesis is a new research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis, holding significant importance for reducing global carbon emissions. New materials are being employed to address new challenges in emerging fields, demonstrating captivating characteristics. Perhaps, sustainable ammonia synthesis will become the most promising application direction in the coming years, with COFs serving as a key enabler in advancing this process.








ABSTRACT

         <title>TEMPO in Solution, Melted, Solid, and Adsorbed on a Silica Surface: A Paramagnetic NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic species can often be measured with EPR and NMR spectroscopy. This is demonstrated using the important radical TEMPO. All 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO could be recorded and assigned. The impact of TEMPO on the chemical shifts of solvent signals and a phosphine is described.








ABSTRACT
TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy) is a stable radical that is phenomenologically interesting and of high importance in synthesis and catalysis. This radical has been studied extensively with EPR and used as a spin tag for biological materials and to probe hydrogen bonding. The NMR properties of TEMPO have not yet been reported. This contribution describes that all 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO are visible in the paramagnetic NMR spectra. The 1H NMR spectra of TEMPO solutions have a chemical shift range of 50&#160;ppm and require only 8 scans. The 13C NMR signals are localized within a chemical shift range of 2600&#160;ppm and are obtained within 30 minutes. Samples prepared with different solvents and TEMPO concentrations have been investigated, and it has been demonstrated that all solvents undergo chemical shift changes due to the presence of TEMPO and adduct formation in the case of CDCl3. The impact of TEMPO on the 31P chemical shift of PPh3 is studied. Higher concentrations of TEMPO in solution lead to narrower signals and the molten substance, measured at 60&#176;C, represents the culmination of this trend. It is demonstrated with paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR that TEMPO adsorbs on a silica surface and displays the chemical shift and linewidth features of a dilute solution of TEMPO.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Base&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [11C]Methylation: Kinetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura [11C]methylation is achieved in a one&#8208;pot process with [11C]CH3I on moderate yields. Electronic effects enable transmetallation without boronate activation, while kinetics and DFT show oxidative addition (heterolytic) as the rate&#8208;limiting step.








ABSTRACT
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most powerful approaches for forming carbon&#8211;carbon bonds in the synthesis of carbon&#8208;11&#8211;labeled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. Typically, Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling is performed in the presence of a base to activate the boron reagent and sustain the catalytic cycle. Here, we investigate the capacity of the Suzuki reaction to proceed under one&#8208;pot base&#8208;free conditions for [11C]methylation reactions and elucidate the mechanistic features that enable this transformation. Conditions were optimized to successfully achieve one&#8208;pot methylation of a model substrate using [11C]CH3I in the absence of base in moderate yields. Systematic substrate studies reveal that the reaction is partly governed by the electronic properties of the boron substrate, suggesting an alternative transmetallation pathway in this case. Kinetic studies using [14C]CH3I, together with kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that oxidative addition remains the rate&#8208;determining step through a heterolytic pathway, consistent with the formation of a cationic Pd(II) intermediate that can undergo transmetallation in the absence of base. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into Pd&#8208;mediated [11C]C&#8211;C bond formation under the unique stoichiometric constraints of radiochemical conditions, expanding the understanding of base&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling reactions with [11C]CH3I.

         <title>Investigating N2 Fixation Using a Bulky Fe(bisphosphine)2 Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulky Fe(0) N2 complex Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 has been prepared and efficiently produces NH3/N2H4 upon treatment with acid, similarly to previously investigated Fe(N2)(depe)2. However, it performs much less effectively during attempted catalytic N2 fixation, allowing investigation of the crucial role of steric hindrance in steps such as N2 binding and protonation.








ABSTRACT
An iron(0) dinitrogen complex incorporating highly sterically encumbered bisphosphine ligands, Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 (dibpe&#160;= iBu2PCH2CH2PiBu2), iBu1&#183;N2, has been prepared and thoroughly characterized, and its N2 fixation reactivity assessed. iBu1&#183;N2 is a more hindered analogue of Fe(N2)(depe)2 (depe&#160;= Et2PCH2CH2PEt2), Et1&#183;N2, which has previously been shown to be an efficient N2 reduction catalyst with unusual selectivity for N2H4, and it was anticipated that greater bulk might make iBu1&#183;N2 less prone to deleterious side reactivity, improving performance. The N2 ligand in iBu1&#183;N2 displays a similar degree of activation to Et1&#183;N2, and the two complexes can stoichiometrically fix N2 with similarly high efficiency upon treatment with suitable acids, giving mixtures of NH3 and N2H4. However, attempts to catalytically fix N2 via treatment of iBu1&#183;N2 with mixtures of excess acids and reductants led to poor results. Mechanistic investigations implicate a combination of more sluggish reaction kinetics and weaker binding of N2 to the intermediate Fe(I) cation [Fe(dibpe)2]+, [iBu1]+, whose study was aided by isolation as its BArF4&#8722; salt (ArF&#160;= 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), and which has also been fully characterized. This weak interaction hinders regeneration of the initial iBu1&#183;N2 via reduction of [iBu1&#183;N2]+, which appears to be necessary to close the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Evaluation of a New Methylimidazole&#8208;Containing Thiosemicarbazone as a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;Targeting Ligand in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

HXE modulates Cu(A&#946;) interaction, reducing ROS production and shifting peptide aggregation in the presence of Cu from toxic amorphous aggregates to less harmful fibrillar structures. These findings highlight HXE potential to interfere with Cu&#8208;induced oxidative stress and aggregation pathways relevant to AD.








ABSTRACT
The binding of copper ions to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and toxic soluble oligomers, contributing to oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, studying compounds with moderate copper affinity is a promising strategy to prevent its interaction with A&#946; and reduce toxicity. Here, we evaluated a new tri&#8208;coordinating thiosemicarbazone (HXE) with chelating properties to regulate cuprotoxicity in AD. The ligand was nontoxic against HT&#8208;22 hippocampal neuronal cells and bound Cu+ and Cu2+ at pH 7.4, with affinity constants (log Kcond) of 8.7 and 12.3, respectively, showing high selectivity over Zn2+ (log Kapp = 5.0). In the presence of A&#946; and Cu2+, HXE formed stable ternary complexes at physiological pH. Ascorbate consumption and coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid fluorescence assays showed that the ligand significantly reduces Cu(A&#946;16)&#8208;mediated ROS production. It also prevented Cu2+&#8208;induced modulation of A&#946;40 self&#8208;assembly and restored the typical fibrillar structure of apo&#8208;A&#946;40 aggregates. Overall, HXE effectively modulates metal&#8208;associated A&#946; toxicity and emerges as a promising candidate for AD bioinorganic management.

         <title>Rectifying Contact&#8208;induced Electronic Regulation of Fe Within Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

The rectifying contact between Fe nanoparticles and N&#8208;doped 3D honeycomb&#8208;like carbon can induce a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) for optimizing charge redistribution of activity center, thereby endowing Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium and zinc air battery performance.








ABSTRACT
Developing efficient and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts from earth&#8208;abundant elements is of great significance for the advancement of sustainable energy technologies such as rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we present a 3D honeycomb&#8208;like nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix decorated to in&#8208;situ form Fe nanoparticles (denoted as Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC) via an ice&#8208;templating method. Theoretical calculations and experimental analyses collectively reveal that the work function mismatch between metallic Fe and the N&#8208;doped carbon host drives spontaneous charge transfer, establishing a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerface to form the rectifying contact. This interfacial effect fine tunes electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, thereby accelerating the ORR kinetics. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V, superior tolerance to methanol, and excellent long&#8208;term durability in alkaline media. When integrated into a liquid zinc&#8208;air battery, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC also delivers a high peak power density of 126.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding cycling stability exceeding 482 cycles, surpassing the benchmark Pt/C&#8208;based system. This work demonstrates that tailoring the electronic structure through interfacial engineering, coupled with rational 3D framework design, provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation nonprecious metal catalysts for practical energy conversion applications.

         <title>A BODIPY/Coumarin Hybrid Probe for Dual&#8208;Mode Fluorescent/FLIM Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Micro&#8208;Polarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe&#160;MBDP&#160;via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It has a broad linear response and strong anti&#8208;interference, quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging, captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences, and its notable lifetime variations with micro&#8208;polarity changes endow MBDP with FLIM capability.








ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) micro&#8208;polarity, with its spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes, regulates key physiological processes like protein folding and lipid metabolism. Its abnormal alterations under pathological conditions, such as oxidative stress are closely linked to metabolic diseases and tumors. Capturing these subtle dynamics to reveal connections with organelle dysfunction remains a critical challenge. Existing traditional physical approaches are complex and cannot achieve real&#8208;time spatial imaging. Fluorescent probes for polarity sensing could provide spatiotemporal resolution, nevertheless, suffer from unstable signals due to nonfixed dual channels, narrow response ranges, interference from viscosity, and nonlinear responses, hindering quantitative monitoring. We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe MBDP via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It shows a broad linear response, strong anti&#8208;interference ability, which quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging. It captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences. Moreover, the remarkable lifetime variations upon polarity change endow MBDP capability under fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM). This probe provides a powerful tool with ratiometric imaging and FLIM dual&#8208;modal monitoring for ER micro&#8208;polarity, aiding in revealing ER&#8208;related physiological/pathological mechanisms and disease research.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;Dimethyl Ribonucleoside Analogs and Their Effects on RNA and Modulation of ADAR Editing</title>

2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl nucleic acids (24mNA) were synthesized, and their biophysical properties in RNA and in RNA editing were evaluated. 24mNA modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner, and based on crystal structures of mono&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;Me&#8208;containing RNA, the 4&#8242;&#8208;Me group projects toward the minor groove of the duplex. Additionally, 24mNA imparts high site specificity for RNA editing 5&#8217;&#8208;UA and 5&#8217;&#8208;AA ADAR targets.








ABSTRACT
Oligonucleotides capable of guiding adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) to carry out therapeutic adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing constitute a promising new class of nucleic acid therapeutics. However, our understanding of the impact of different chemical modifications at the various nucleotide positions in ADAR guide strands is limited. While ribose 2&#8242; modification is common in ADAR&#8208;directing guides, less is known about the impact of modification at the 4&#8242; position. Here we describe the synthesis of several 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl derivatives of adenosine, uridine, and cytidine and their incorporation into RNA. In addition, we show that these analogs maintain the base pairing selectivity of their parent nucleoside and modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner. High&#8208;resolution crystal structures of RNA duplexes bearing 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl A or U showed that these analogs adopt a C3&#8242;&#8208;endo sugar pucker and project 4&#8242; substituents into the minor groove. Finally, we find that 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyluridine and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyladenosine strategically positioned in ADAR guide strands can increase the selectivity of the editing reaction for target sequences with adjacent off&#8208;target adenosines. This work advances our understanding of the ADAR reaction mechanism and informs the design of ADAR guide strands with improved selectivity.

Here we describe the synthesis of several 4&#8242;-C&#945;-methyl and 2&#8242;-O, 4&#8242;-C&#945;-dimethyl derivatives of adenosine, uridine, and cytidine and their incorporation into RNA. In addition, we show that these analogs maintain the base pairing selectivity of their parent nucleoside and modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog-dependent manner. High-resolution crystal structures of RNA duplexes bearing 4&#8242;-C&#945;-methyl A or U showed that these analogs adopt a C3&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; sugar pucker and project 4&#8242; substituents into the minor groove. Finally, we find that 2&#8242;-O, 4&#8242;-C&#945;-dimethyluridine and 2&#8242;-O, 4&#8242;-C&#945;-dimethyladenosine strategically positioned in ADAR guide strands can increase the selectivity of the editing reaction for target sequences with adjacent off-target adenosines. This work advances our understanding of the ADAR reaction mechanism and informs the design of ADAR guide strands with improved selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Chain Magnet With Strong Anisotropy and Ferromagnetic IntraChain Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance single&#8208;chain magnet (Ueff = 560 K) exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy and ferromagnetic intrachain interactions using redox&#8208;active bridging ligands.








ABSTRACT
Co(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer is reported as a new benchmark single&#8208;chain magnet (SCM), exhibiting an energy barrier (Ueff) of 560 K and a blocking temperature (TB) of 21.5 K&#8210;both the highest values observed for SCM systems. The magnetic behavior originates from the synergistic balance between strong axial anisotropy (DCo = &#8211;83 cm&#8722;1) and moderate ferromagnetic exchange (JCo&#8208;Co = +17.7 K), promoting long&#8208;range spin correlation over thousands of magnetic ions. Detailed analysis of the correlation length and domain&#8208;wall energy reveals a wide SCM regime and a 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D magnetic crossover at low temperature. Unlike previously reported radical&#8208;bridged SCMs, this work demonstrates a clean, intrinsic design strategy for realizing extreme single&#8208;chain magnetism, offering new principles for developing robust molecular spin materials.

         <title>Acridane[4]Arenes: Scope of the Macro&#8208;Tetramerization, Derivatization Options, and Water&#8208;Soluble Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridane[4]arenes (A4As) are introduced as a versatile, conformationally restricted macrocyclic platform accessible in six steps and good yields. Expanded lower&#8208;rim scope, selective upper&#8208;rim functionalization, and N&#8208;Boc modification enable controlled self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage that binds tetrabutylammonium salts. Further Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig diversification and ionic substituents afford water&#8208;soluble derivatives, establishing A4As as a broadly modular scaffold for supramolecular applications.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles are essential scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry, offering versatile platforms for functionalization. Here, we report the optimization, expanded scope, and comprehensive derivatization strategies for acridane[4]arenes (A4A), a large macrocyclic platform featuring a conformationally restricted bowl shape analogous to resorcin[4]arene. The scope of the macrocyclization was expanded with four distinct &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents at the lower rim. Strategies for selective functionalization at the upper rim were developed, including&#160;N&#8208;Boc protection at each acridane subunit. This modification induced self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage in apolar solvents, which form stable host&#8211;guest complexes with tetrabutylammonium salts. Further functionalization of the acridane nitrogen via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling allowed installation of aromatic groups bearing diverse functional handles. Finally, water&#8208;soluble A4A derivatives were achieved by introducing charged ionic &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazolium. These results establish A4As as a highly modular macrocyclic platform with broad potential for supramolecular applications.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrothiomethylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hermetically sealable, inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks are used to explore new reactivities of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive titanium catalysts. As a result, methyl sulfides undergo efficient &#945;&#8208;alkylation with alkenes in the presence of a titanium catalyst precursor, a formamidinato ligand, and a Lewis acid, yielding branched hydrothiomethylation products with excellent regioselectivity. Graphical design by Melissa Schl&#252;schen.








ABSTRACT
A catalyst screening for six different &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of methyl sulfides with unsaturated substrates performed in hermetically sealable and inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks is described. As a result, a new titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiomethylation reaction of alkenes, which takes place under C&#9472;H bond activation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom of simple methyl sulfides, is presented. The best catalyst is prepared in situ from the readily available titanium catalyst precursor Ti(CH2SiMe3)4, a formamidinato ligand precursor, and the Lewis acid [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]. Although selected 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, for example, cyclohexene and cyclopentene, undergo successful hydrothiomethylation reactions, the best results are obtained with monosubstituted 1&#8208;alkenes. In these cases, the reactions take place with excellent regioselectivity and give branched hydrothiomethylation products exclusively (23 examples). When dimethyl sulfide is used as a substrate, either the monohydrothiomethylation product or the dihydrothiomethylation product can be obtained with very good selectivity.

         <title>Resolving a Nearly Two&#8208;Centuries&#8208;Old Mystery: On the Structural Chemistry and Physicochemical Properties of Compounds Associated With the Term Ammelide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, was solved almost 200 years after its discovery by Liebig. Moreover, three modifications of its 1:1 adduct with ammeline were structurally elucidated, consisting of layers with a honeycomb motif analogous to melamine cyanurate. Finally, ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were prepared to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.








ABSTRACT
Ammelide, also known as melanuric acid, is a simple molecular compound, which can be regarded as the double hydrolysis product of the industrially relevant compound melamine. Within this work, the first structural description of ammelide was provided almost 200 years after its discovery. This not only gave the first unambiguous evidence that ammelide's preferred tautomeric form in the solid is 6&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione, but also showed that ammelide adopts a layered structure similar to the closely related ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three modifications of the 1:1 adduct between ammeline and ammelide were elucidated, which form layers with a honeycomb motif and hexagonal voids analogous to melamine cyanurate. Differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that both pure ammelide and its adduct with ammeline have exceptionally high thermal stabilities, resulting from their dense hydrogen bonding networks. Finally, the synthesis and structural characterization of the ammelide's nitrate and perchlorate salts were carried out to examine the potential of ammelide as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials through sensitivity measurements and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Partial Phase Transition to Construct Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterophase Catalyst for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an alkali salt&#8208;assisted annealing method to precisely synthesize CoMnOx with tunable crystallinity and systematically elucidating the structure&#8208;activity dependency between crystallinity and CO2 photoreduction performance.








ABSTRACT
Amorphous/crystalline catalysts can effectively integrate the advantages of both phases, overcoming the low active site density in crystalline phases and the poor charge separation in amorphous ones. In this work, we report an alkali salt&#8208;assisted partial phase transition strategy to synthesize amorphous/crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;400 nanosheets for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CoMnOx&#8208;400 demonstrates superior CO production performance (146.09 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 93.6% selectivity), significantly outperforming amorphous CoMnOx&#8208;260 (66.65 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and crystalline CoMnOx&#8208;500 (89.52 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Supported by systematic characterizations, we propose that the high efficiency of CoMnOx&#8208;400 is attributed to two factors: (i) the charge migration between amorphous and crystalline phases across the seamless contact interface can enhance charge separation efficiency, and (ii) the amorphous domains can provide abundant surface defective active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. This work highlights the critical role of phase engineering, particularly the construction of amorphous/crystalline structures, in advancing solar&#8208;driven catalytic applications.

         <title>Deciphering the Molecular Mechanisms of Phosphoester Bond Formation in Abiotic Conditions With Reactive Neural Network Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores how phosphoester bonds, essential in biology, could form without enzymes in early Earth conditions. Using machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials, it maps reaction pathways of two phosphate forms in water. The role of solvent in assisting proton transfers is analyzed, revealing key effects with implications for prebiotic chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Phosphoester bonds are fundamental components of both small molecules and polymeric biomolecules, most notably nucleic acids. Their formation from alcohol groups and phosphate is a significant challenge for living systems, as it involves substantial free&#8208;energy barriers. These barriers, while hindering bond formation, also ensure the kinetic stability of the resulting biomolecular structures. This duality presents a major obstacle in understanding the emergence of RNA&#8208;based systems at the origins of life, where protein enzymes capable of catalyzing such reactions were absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying phosphoester formation is therefore essential for developing non&#8208;biological catalytic strategies. In a recent proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study (Benayad et&#160;al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 121 e2322040121 (2024)), we demonstrated that machine&#8208;learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be effectively trained and employed to sample the reactive pathways of the uncatalyzed reaction in water on microsecond timescales. In this work, we significantly expand upon our previous analysis to offer a detailed molecular characterization of two families of mechanisms, associative and dissociative, each associated with a variety in the order of proton exchange events. We focus on the two protonation states of phosphate prevalent under near&#8208;neutral conditions (H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ and HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$). We find that dissociative pathways are consistently lower in free&#8208;energy as compared to associative ones, and that H2PO4&#8722;${\rm H}_2{\rm PO}_{4}^-$ is much more reactive than HPO42&#8722;${\rm HPO}_{4}^{2-}$. Special attention is given to the role of the solvent, elucidating its involvement in the reaction process, as well as the contributions of proton transfer events and oxygen substitution at the phosphorus center. We conclude by proposing molecular&#8208;level explanations for the observed differences in reactivity between the two phosphate protonation states based on charge redistribution during the&#160;reaction.

         <title>Twisted 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Azaperopyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
A synthesis of hitherto unknown 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;azaperopyrenes, twisted nitrogen&#8208;doped peropyrenes, is reported. The synthesis is based on a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated benzannulation of alkynes. Key alkyne intermediates are synthesized via two complementary routes, including a Pd/C&#8208;catalyzed, copper&#8208; and amine&#8208;free Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling of (hetero)aryl chlorides, enabling access to both carbo&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted peropyrene frameworks. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals twisted conformations with bay and end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angles ranging between 10.0&#8211;19.9&#176; and 5.5&#8211;25.0&#176;, respectively, as well as unprecedented conformational isomorphism. The influence of regioselective single N&#8208;doping within the twisted peropyrene framework on the photophysical and electrochemical properties were elucidated by combined experimental and computational studies and compared with those of the carbon congener.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dependent DNA Binding and Cytotoxicity of Palladium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2], the choice of the bidentate ligand A drives a different binding mode toward double&#8208;stranded DNA and is crucial for conferring cytotoxic properties to these complexes. The 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand renders Pd(II) complexes cytotoxic, whereas (1R,2R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocycloexanerenders&#160;them inactive.








ABSTRACT
In the search for alternatives to platinum anticancer drugs, palladium complexes have attracted considerable interest. In this frame, six square planar palladium(II) complexes with the general formula [PdAB2] were prepared, where the ligand A is (1R,2R)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), and the ligand B is chlorine, iodine, or pyridine. The biological properties of the investigated compounds were systematically evaluated to identify trends linked to ligand variations. The complexes were synthesized following established experimental procedures and characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. DNA interactions were investigated through melting experiments and the ethidium bromide (EB) displacement assay. The obtained data suggested covalent adduct formation as the preferential binding mode for the DACH&#8208;containing complexes, whereas intercalation was predominant for the phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes. Notably, at least one compound appears to interact with DNA through both modes. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated against three human ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780R, and SKOV3) as well as a healthy control cell line (HSkM, human skeletal myoblasts). Significant cytotoxic activity was observed for the Phen&#8208;containing complexes, with compound 3 also showing a good selectivity index. Conversely, DACH&#8208;containing complexes were found to be non&#8208;cytotoxic.

         <title>Harnessing MOF Derived Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;CeO2 Nano Catalyst for CO2&#8208;Activated Soft Oxidation of Furfural to Furoic Acid</title>

ABSTRACT
CO2 as a soft oxidant is scarcely explored in literature for furfural oxidation to furoic acid, and where CeO2, capitalizes on the synergistic effect of FLPs for enhanced CO2 reduction and furfural oxidation. This study presents a comparative analysis by the synthesis method to produce hydrothermal and MOF&#8208;derived CeO2 nanocatalyst and their effect on the formation of oxygen vacancies and metastable Ce3+ ions. The normalized surface concentration derived from XPS At% and specific surface area effectively quantifies accessible Ce3+ sites and oxygen vacancies, capturing FLP sites. Oxygen vacancies near surface Ce3+ sites (FLPs) critically modulated the catalytic performance, and evidenced by high turnover number (TON). FTIR adsorption study revealed that CO2 forms bidentate carbonate species and furfural, bi&#8208;coordination via &#951;2&#8208; (C, O) mode on the catalyst surface. Further active site masking strategy helped to understand and validate the crucial role of FLPs. The Central Composite Design model was utilized to optimize the reaction conditions and obtained high furfural conversion (99%) and furoic acid selectivity (99%). The catalyst was resistant to active site leaching and exhibited excellent stability, recyclability, and robustness. The findings highlight a potential pathway for the catalytic soft oxidation of furfural to furoic acid by CO2 utilization.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Phosphorus Cross&#8208;Anion Coupling on Rare&#8208;Earth Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes toward disubstituted phosphorus oxides provides a new class of seven&#8208;membered rare&#8208;earth metallacycles containing a C&#9552;P double bond. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through two steps: the activation of the P&#9472;H bond of disubstituted phosphorus oxides, and a formal reductive elimination process leading to the formation of a C&#9472;P bond. PIO analyses are applied to better understand the bonding properties and electron flow of the essential transition states.








ABSTRACT
Carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;anion coupling reaction on rare&#8208;earth center is implemented through formal reductive elimination process. Phosphine oxides with different substituents are treated to prove the universality of this method. Computational approaches are applied to confirm that the reaction generated a C&#9552;P double bond during the process, and the two&#8208;electron reductive elimination process occurs with the assistance of the butadienyl backbone. The orbital interactions of the key transition states are clarified by principal interacting orbital (PIO) analysis. This work significantly expands the applicability of rare&#8208;earth metallacycles and further reveals their unique reactivity, providing a C&#9472;P coupling, azametallacycle, metallacycle, rare&#8208;earth metal novel strategy for constructing phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Preactivation of 3DPAFIPN into Highly Active Photocatalytic Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to avoid competitive radical substitution of the CN group, the pre&#8208;irradiation of 3DPAFIPN (ReAct&#8208;Light) resulted in the formation of cyclic photocatalyst derivatives PC1 and PC2. The thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reaction demonstrated greater catalytic performance and stability of the PC1/PC2 forms in comparison to the initial 3DPAFIPN and the in situ generated CN&#8208;substituted photocatalyst form (PC3).








ABSTRACT
Cyanoarene photocatalysts such as 3DPAFIPN are widely employed in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven transformations, yet their intrinsic structural dynamics under irradiation remain poorly understood. Here we reveal that 3DPAFIPN undergoes light&#8208;induced reconfiguration into distinct cyclized and radical substitution products, with the parent species ultimately decomposing under reaction conditions. Using a combination of Photo&#8208;Chem&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and TLC&#8208;mapping, we directly monitored the evolution of catalytic forms and identified the cyclized derivatives as the true active species in thiol&#8211;yne&#8211;ene coupling. The major cyclized product was isolated and structurally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unambiguous experimental evidence for light&#8208;driven photocatalyst reconfiguration. Compared with the precursor, the cyclized catalysts display enhanced stability against cyanide substitution by radical intermediates and deliver higher efficiency and selectivity. This study establishes a generalizable workflow for dissecting dynamic photocatalyst behavior and extends the ReAct&#8208;Light concept, highlighting light&#8208;triggered structural evolution as a new design principle for adaptive and robust photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Azoheteroarene&#8208;Modified Grapiprants Serving as Photoswitchable EP4 Antagonists</title>

ABSTRACT
Photopharmacology offers a novel approach to eliminate side effects of chemotherapy treatment via site&#8208;specific activation of light&#8208;active anticancer agents, which are typically constructed by the installation of light&#8208;cleavable or light&#8208;switchable molecules onto known drugs or inhibitors. The light&#8208;switchable drugs being able to reversibly control biological activities are more advantageous, but the design of such compounds is very challenging. We synthesized a small series of photoswitchable S&#8208;arylsulfonylurea&#8208;based EP4 antagonists by substituting a core structural unit of a potent EP4 antagonist, grapiprant. In vitro cell&#8208;based EP4 activity studies revealed that all light&#8208;induced cis isomers of these compounds are more potent than their trans isomers. Compound 3, with an azopyrazole photoswitch and a para&#8208;methyl substitution in the S&#8208;phenyl ring, displayed the highest EP4 antagonism by its cis isomer and a considerably larger activity difference (ca. 1.8&#8208;fold) between trans and cis photoisomers. It showed (near) complete photoisomerization (&#8764;95%&#8211;98%) upon 365&#160;nm (forward) and 520&#160;nm (reverse) light irradiations. The metastable cis isomers demonstrated high thermal stability (t1/2 = 1&#8211;3 days). All compounds were resistant to photobleaching and showed impressive stability for reduction with glutathione (10&#160;mM). This study constitutes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to design photoswitchable EP4 antagonists, and the structure&#8208;activity relationship revealed herein may help design more potent grapiprant derivatives.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Functionalization of 4&#8208;Methylcoumarins: A Vinylogous Nucleophile Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective offers an in&#8208;depth summary of recent progress in catalytic asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It further outlines prospective strategies for designing efficient catalytic systems to enable new transformations, emphasizing their emerging significance and unexplored potential in medicinal chemistry.








ABSTRACT
The broad utility of coumarin scaffolds has long intrigued organic chemists, driving extensive research into their synthesis and functionalization. Over the decades, functionalized coumarins have emerged as privileged frameworks in natural products, biologically and pharmaceutically relevant molecules, as well as in dyes and advanced materials. While numerous strategies have been developed for C&#8211;H functionalization at the C&#8208;3, C&#8208;4, and C&#8208;7 positions through organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and photocatalytic methods, the pursuit of remote C&#8211;H functionalization in coumarin analogues, particularly as an alternative mode of activation that harnesses their vinylogous nucleophilicity remains both compelling and challenging. This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of recent catalytic advances in the asymmetric remote C&#8211;H functionalization of 4&#8208;alkylcoumarins as pro&#8208;vinylogous nucleophiles. It also highlights future directions for the development of efficient catalytic systems to unlock novel transformations, underscoring their untapped potential in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Flexizyme&#8208;Based Strategy for the Synthesis of Stable, Non&#8208;Isomerizable Amide&#8208;Linked 2&#8217;&#8208;Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNAs and their Shortened Analogs</title>

In this study, we reveal that flexizymes, engineered ribozymes known for strict 3&#8217;&#8208;regiospecific aminoacylation, unexpectedly generate the elusive 2&#8217;&#8208;amide aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA analog from 2&#8217;&#8208;amine&#8208;containing tRNA (2&#8217;&#8208;NH2&#8208;tRNA) and ester&#8208;activated amino acid (AA&#8208;DBE). A fast two&#8208;step mechanism enables efficient formation of stable 2&#8217;&#8208;amide AA&#8208;tRNAs, uncovering an unanticipated facet of flexizyme catalytic versatility.








ABSTRACT
The study of the regiospecificity of aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA (AA&#8208;tRNA)&#8208;dependent enzymes and their structural characterization with AA&#8208;tRNAs are limited by rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond linking amino acid to tRNA. To overcome this limitation, stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs bearing hydrolysis&#8208;resistant linkages, such as amide bonds or ester bioisosteres, have been developed. These analogs are valuable tools for investigating interactions between AA&#8208;tRNAs and various enzymes or ribonucleoproteins, including elongation factors, ribosomes, Fem&#8208;family transferases, and cyclodipeptide synthases. However, their synthesis remains technically challenging. Recently, flexizymes&#8212;engineered ribozymes capable of aminoacylating tRNAs with diverse amino acids or analogs&#8212;have enabled the synthesis of 3&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked AA&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs. Due to their inherent specificity for 3&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation, flexizymes have not been used to generate 2&#8242;&#8208;amide&#8208;linked analogs, and such regioisomers have remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that while flexizymes cannot directly aminoacylate the 2&#8242; position, they can nevertheless mediate the synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;aminoacyl&#8208;NH&#8208;tRNAs via a two&#8208;step regioisomerization mechanism with excellent yields. This finding provides new insights into the binding mode of AA&#8208;tRNAs to flexizymes and expands the chemical space of stable AA&#8208;tRNA analogs. Access to both 3&#8242;&#8208; and 2&#8242;&#8208;amide regioisomers will enable more precise studies of AA&#8208;tRNA recognition and catalysis by various AA&#8208;tRNA&#8208;dependent systems.

         <title>Intermediate CuIIATCUN Species Reacts With Biomolecules Within Time Windows of Biological Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated that a partially coordinated intermediate species formed in a multistep reaction of the Cu(II) ion with a model peptide representing the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin exhibits remarkable lability and redox&#8208;activity, which strongly supports its physiological relevance.








ABSTRACT
The ATCUN motif is the N&#8208;terminal peptide/protein sequence Xaa&#8208;Zaa&#8208;His, bearing the N&#8208;terminal amine and Zaa &#8800; Pro, which effectively binds some transition metal ions including CuII in a square&#8208;planar geometry. This motif has attracted much attention, due to its distinctive copper binding properties and abundance in human proteome. However, the inertness and poor reactivity of CuIIATCUN complexes appear at odds with the biological reality of dynamically changing copper balance, which is maintained through redox and trans&#8208;chelation reactions. We have demonstrated a multi&#8208;step character of Cu2+ binding to ATCUN sequences, with partially coordinated intermediate species present within time windows spanning from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. Based on indirect evidence and chemical analogy we previously proposed that these transient species could serve as reactive intermediates in biological copper redox and exchange reactions. Here we used double mixing stopped&#8208;flow experiments to address this issue directly for a model tetrapeptide (DAHK) representing the ATCUN motif at the N&#8208;terminus of Human Serum Albumin. We found that, unlike the final 4&#8208;nitrogen coordinated (4N) square&#8208;planar complex, the transient 2N intermediate readily exchanged CuII with histidine and was rapidly reduced to CuI by glutathione. These results pave way to re&#8208;evaluation of physiological roles of ATCUN motifs.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Strategies for Generating Polymer Protocells That Mimic Cellular Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on polymeric protocells produced using a bottom&#8208;up approach. Polymer&#8208;based assemblies guarantee stability and designability by adjusting the properties of the amphiphilic copolymers used. The review covers protocell architectures, production, and their intra&#8208; and intercellular communication mechanisms.








ABSTRACT
In the last decade, the design of artificial organelles and cells has emerged as an area with far&#8208;reaching implications due to the potential that such systems have for both understanding bioprocesses in a simple and controlled manner, and for developing advanced solutions for medical applications. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing artificial organelles and cells as single compartments or compartments&#8208;in&#8208;compartments to enable the study of internal reactions. However, a major challenge in approaching natural processes is to be able to mimic complex signaling and communication pathways. In this review, we present bottom&#8208;up strategies that introduce polymer&#8208;based protocells for studying intra&#8208; and intercellular communication. Whereas intracellular communication involves in situ reactions that are triggered by an external stimulus, intercellular communication is achieved by exchange of chemical signals between two different types of protocell, the &#8220;sender&#8221; and &#8220;receiver.&#8221; By spatially segregating different molecules and nano&#8208;assemblies that serve as artificial organelles in sender and receiver protocells, respectively, various reactions have been studied, including single and cascade enzymatic reactions. Such interconnected systems, which facilitate exchange and flow of information in a close&#8208;to&#8208;nature manner, increase our insight into complex natural signaling pathways and hold promise for creation of programmable artificial cell&#8208; and tissue&#8208;like systems for tomorrow's medicine.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Guanidinate Scaffold for the Construction of Unique Zr(IV)&#8208;Li(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique heterobimetallic compounds of Zr/Li, 1 and 2, are reported. Compound 1 adopts a dimeric structure in the solid state, whereas compound 2 forms a polymeric chain, composed of repeating CpZr&#8208;BG&#8211;LiCp units. As a proof of concept, the hydroboration of nitriles was investigated: compound 2 exhibited better catalytic activity than compound 1 under neat conditions.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we report bis&#8208;guanidinate (BG)&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic lithium&#8211;zirconium organometallic compounds, revealing new dimensions of ligand&#8208;induced structural versatility. Reactions of lithiated salts of bis&#8208;guanidinates bearing 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl (XylLLi) or 2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl (DepLLi) aryl&#8208;substituents (where L&#160;= {(ArHN)(ArN)&#8211;C&#9552;N&#8211;C&#9552;(NAr)(NHAr)}; Ar&#160;= Xyl&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3 or Dep&#160;= 2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3) with Cp2ZrHCl (Schwartz's reagent) in benzene proceed via elimination of H2 and HCl to afford well&#8208;defined Li/Zr heterobimetallic complexes. The formation of these heterobimetallic compounds was confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C{1H}, and &#8311;Li and DOSY NMR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Structural analysis shows that the LX&#8208;type bis&#8208;guanidinate framework in LLi undergoes conversion to an unprecedented L2X3 coordination mode, wherein the ligand acts as trianionic (tritopic) toward zirconium and neutral (ditopic) toward lithium, generating two four&#8208;membered and one six&#8208;membered metallacycles. Solid&#8208;state analysis reveals pronounced structural diversity, with one complex adopting a dimeric arrangement and the other forming a zig&#8208;zag coordination polymer composed of CpZr&#8211;bis&#8208;guanidinate&#8211;LiCp units. Notably, the polymeric complex exhibits catalytic activity, showing efficient dihydroboration of nitriles under neat conditions and effective hydroboration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, carbodiimide, alkyne, and isocyanates, highlighting the catalytic relevance of polymeric BG&#8208;supported Li/Zr architecture.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Enolate Enabled Chemoselective Twofold Allylation of Alkenyl&#8208;Keto&#8208;Imines Using Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Construction of Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive chemoselective asymmetric allylation on imine of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;imines is developed through in situ generation of a key boron&#8208;enolate intermediate. Our previously achieved allylation&#8208;oxy&#8208;Cope rearrangement sequence was utilized for the enolate formation, which was reacted with a second allylboronic acid nucleophile, giving rise to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters.








ABSTRACT
A twofold allylation strategy is developed for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ketones bearing both adjacent and nonadjacent stereocenters including quaternary ones. Both linear and branched&#8208;allyl moieties were incorporated using either same or different nucleophiles through successive chemoselective allylations on alkenyl&#8208;keto&#8208;imines in a single operation. Notably, in the whole reaction sequence, while the first allyl nucleophile reacts selectively on ketone, the second one reacts on imine. Control experiments and DFT calculations supported the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Antioxidant Agents: Understanding Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese (Mn)&#8208;based materials are promising for treating diseases caused by oxidative stress. This review summarizes how their structure affects antioxidant activities, focusing on Mn valence, composition, size, and shape. It also highlights their roles in immune regulation and cellular protection against oxidative damage. Finally, challenges and perspectives on future research are provided.








ABSTRACT
Eliminating reactive oxygen species has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy for diseases related to oxidative stress, such as inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Manganese (Mn) is an essential component of natural antioxidant enzymes, for example, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), thus has been extensively used to design artificial antioxidants. This review provides a systematic summary of how the structural engineering of Mn&#8208;based antioxidant agents influences their SOD/CAT&#8208;like activity. Critical structural parameters, such as Mn valence states, ligand coordination, codoping with other elements, particle size, and morphology, are discussed to correlate the structure&#8212;antioxidant performance relationships. Two major biological functions, including regulating immune cell polarization and protecting cells from oxidative damage, are highlighted. Finally, challenges in this field are outlined, and our perspectives on future research are provided. It is expected that this review will provide insights for the further development of advanced Mn&#8208;based antioxidants for biomedical applications.

         <title>B&#8722;B Sites in Molten Boron Oxide are Superior to Cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B Sites for Methane Oxidation to Formaldehyde and Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative dehydrogenation of methane over molten boron oxide involves cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B (8&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered) and B&#8722;B sites. Our comprehensive mechanistic investigation reveals that B&#8722;B site exhibits the lowest activation barrier toward CH4 to HCHO conversion. Further, QRO and IBO analyses indicate that, at the B&#8722;B site electron transfer originates form &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond, whereas in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B motifs, it arises from oxygen lone pairs within the ring.








ABSTRACT
Boron oxide (B2O3) has recently emerged as a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of methane, with remarkable selectivity for formaldehyde (HCHO) and carbon monoxide (CO) at 823 K. Since B2O3 melts at &#8764;725 K, the ODH reaction is likely to proceed in its molten state. In 2023, ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations by Rousseau and co&#8208;workers revealed that molten B2O3 comprises of 8&#8208;, 6&#8208;, 4&#8208;membered cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites and a B&#8722;B site. So herein, we carried out a detailed DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation for CH4 oxidation across these structural motifs with 1O2 and 3O2. Due to the multireference character of 1O2 and its associated species, CASSCF/NEVPT2 methodology was employed. Among all motifs, the B&#8722;B site exhibits superior catalytic activity toward HCHO formation (36.6&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1), while cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites require significantly higher activation barriers (&#8764; 50 to 78&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Orbital analysis reveals that electron transfer in cyclic B&#8722;O&#8722;B sites originates from oxygen lone&#8208;pair located in the ring, while at the B&#8722;B site, it originates from &#963;(B&#8722;B) bond. In addition, CO formation is thermodynamically more favorable than CO2, consistent with existing experimental observations. Overall, these mechanistic insights offer a foundation for designing efficient, metal&#8208;free methane oxidation catalysts.

         <title>Bicyclic 1,4&#8208;Dioxepanes for Drug&#160;Discovery: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical, and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach to the multigram synthesis of fused bicyclic and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes based on the base&#8208;promoted double alkylation of saturated heterocyclic diols with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene is developed. Physicochemical and structural characterization of the proposed ring systems through pKa and LogP measurements and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies illustrated their potential for isosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry.








ABSTRACT
Fused and spirocyclic 1,4&#8208;dioxepanes bearing a saturated heterocyclic amine ring are proposed as promising molecular frameworks for early drug discovery. The key step of their synthesis included double alkylation of an appropriate saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic 1,2&#8208;diol with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dichloroisobutylene. Further chemical modification of the terminal exocyclic double bond in the resulting bicyclic intermediates provided access to a series of valuable building blocks bearing common functional groups as the synthetic handles. The developed protocols demonstrated high efficiency at multigram scale. The potential of the synthesized bicyclic compounds for isosteric replacements was evaluated by physicochemical and conformational profiling, that is, pKa and LogP measurements, virtual library enumeration, and exit vector analysis based on X&#8208;ray diffraction data.

         <title>Radical Stability Paradox: Substituent Effects versus Heats of Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rethinking molecular stability: Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses show that the greater stability of tertiary over primary organic radicals is not caused by stabilizing substituent effects but by the inherent stability of the substituent.








ABSTRACT
Recently, we have shown that alkyl substituents destabilize the carbon radical center of organic radicals. However, seemingly in contradiction with this earlier finding, the series of isomeric n&#8208;butyl, s&#8208;butyl, and t&#8208;butyl radicals shows an increasingly stable (less positive) heat of formation &#8710;Hf, despite an increasing number of alkyl substituents at the radical center. Herein, we provide a solution to this apparent paradox of contradicting pictures. The crux of the matter is that &#8710;Hf not only comprises the substituent effect on the radical center but also the intrinsic stability of the substituents. Furthermore, we provide a generalizable framework for extracting the actual intrinsic substituent effects from experimental and computational data, an approach with broad applicability to radical chemistry, thermochemistry, and beyond.

         <title>Photoinduced Spirocyclization for the Synthesis of Spirocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review offers a comprehensive summary on the synthesis of spirocyclic compounds via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization reactions over the past decade. These reactions are classified into five main categories according to the specific cyclization methods employed.








ABSTRACT
Spirocycles represent an important class of 3D skeletons that are commonly encountered in natural products and pharmaceutical agents. Owing to their remarkable properties and fine&#8208;tuning of conformational and physicochemical characteristics, the synthesis of spirocyclic motifs has been extensively investigated over the past decade. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced spirocyclization for the construction of spirocyclic compounds, with a focus on catalytic methods, substrate scope, and mechanistic aspects. In the conclusion of this review, the limitations and challenges within this field are highlighted, and potential future research directions are also explored.

A donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) fluorophore bearing a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine core forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with neutral donors such as sulfonamides or water. This interaction modulates both ground and excited states, enabling red&#8208;shifted emission and enhanced photoluminescence in solution and solid state.








ABSTRACT
Modulating photophysical properties via hydrogen bonding offers a powerful strategy for designing supramolecular functional materials and responsive optical systems. Here, we present a U&#8208;shaped dipyridophenazine (DPyPHZ)&#8208;cored donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;donor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D) scaffold that serves as a hydrogen&#8208;bond receptor capable of forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds, enabling simultaneous modulation of both ground and excited states. We developed an efficient synthetic route to this &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and demonstrated that its absorption and emission spectra undergo pronounced red&#8208;shifts upon 1:1 complexation with neutral hydrogen&#8208;bond donors such as sulfonamides and even water. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction stabilizes the charge&#8208;transfer excited state, leading to enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color modulation. Notably, these optical responses persist in the solid state when embedded in a polymer matrix, enabling emission color switching without fluorophore aggregation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the formation of a well&#8208;defined bifurcated hydrogen&#8208;bonding complex in the solid state. Comparative studies with structural analogues highlight the importance of the electron&#8208;density hotspot in DPyPHZ for selective and directional hydrogen bonding. This work introduces a supramolecular design strategy for precise dual&#8208;state photophysical control, providing a platform for environmentally responsive luminescent materials with potential in sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Novel Bioactive Multifunctional Polyphenols: A Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Approach</title>

One&#8208;step synthesis of complex alkyl oxystilbenin glucosides (6&#8208;47% yield) in alcoholic medium. Switching to ter&#8208;BuOH as solvent afforded &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside, with high selectivity and high yield (&gt; 90%), that can be upgraded by enzymatic esterification to alkyl &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucosides. These new compounds exhibit tunable hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and valuable antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties.








ABSTRACT
Stilbenes, such as resveratrol, possess numerous biological activities desirable in various industrial sectors (e.g., pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic). However, these activities are counteracted by their low bioavailability. In order to achieve an optimal hydrophylic/lipophilic balance (HLB) and thus maximize bioavailability, alkyl glucoside dimers of resveratrol (i.e., C2 to C12 alkyl oxystilbenin diglucosides (C8&#8208;O4&#8217; linkage) and &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside (C3&#8208;C8&#8217; linkage)) were synthesized from piceid&#8212;a &#946;&#8208;glucoside of resveratrol&#8212;in one or two steps using a silver acetate&#8208;mediated oxidative coupling in various alcoholic solvents as the key step. &#948;&#8208;Viniferin diglucoside was functionalized by lauric acid using an enzyme&#8208;mediated esterification. HLB values, determined from Log P (the partition coefficient between water and octan&#8208;1&#8208;ol), were calculated for the nine synthesized compounds, revealing that four exhibited values within the range considered favorable for bioabsorption. Finally, antiradical and antioxidant activities were assessed using DPPH and ORAC tests, respectively, prior to anti&#8208;inflammatory testing on dermal human cells. These assays have shown very promising results with some activities overpassing that of resveratrol.

         <title>A Bifunctional Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyzes Hydroxylation and Aryl&#8208;Aryl Ether Formation in the Biosynthesis of Emestrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of emestrin J (5) to emestrin (1) by three P450 enzymes from the cluster (eme) in Emericella quadrilineata. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the 15&#8208;membered lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings, while EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring.








ABSTRACT
Emestrins, a subgroup of epipolythiodioxopiperazines, are originated from cyclo&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Phe and feature a dihydrooxepine ring. They contain typically a 15&#8208;membered lactone ring with an aryl&#8208;aryl ether linkage. Despite considerable progress in elucidating epipolythiodioxopiperazine biosynthesis, the enzymatic mechanism for the ether bond formation in emestrins remains uncharacterized. We identified a putative gene cluster (eme) in the fungus Emericella quadrilineata with three unknown P450 enzymes, EmeE, EmeR, and EmeO. Gene deletion, feeding experiments, and in vitro assays proved that EmeE and EmeR install regioselective and stereospecific hydroxyl groups at the &#223;&#8208;positions of the diketopiperazine ring. EmeO acts as a bifunctional enzyme for the construction of the lactone ring via an aryl&#8208;aryl ether bond formation and simultaneous hydroxylation between phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic rings. To the best of our knowledge, such enzymatic reactions have not been reported prior to this study.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Spin&#8208;Labeling of RNA With Short Hairpins Containing the Rigid Spin Label &#199;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of sophisticated spectroscopic probes into RNA often requires an extensive synthetic effort. To minimize that, a noncovalent spin&#8208;labeling strategy using spin&#8208;labeled hairpins has been developed. The assembly of hairpins containing the rigid spin label &#199;m with RNA duplexes was monitored by EPR spectroscopy, including PELDOR. Short complementary overhangs facilitated efficient helical stacking.








ABSTRACT
Understanding the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids is essential for elucidating their complex biological functions. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique to extract such information. However, its application to nucleic acids requires the incorporation of spin labels, usually nitroxides. Rigid spin labels are more informative EPR probes than flexible ones, since they offer high&#8208;precision distance measurements and can provide information about the relative orientation of spin labels. However, the synthesis and incorporation of such rigid labels is nontrivial. Here we describe a strategy in which the rigid spin label &#199;m is incorporated into a small hairpin, which in turn can be used to label several different oligonucleotides noncovalently through helical stacking. We have studied the noncovalent assembly of spin&#8208;labeled RNA hairpins with RNA duplexes by both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy, specifically pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called DEER). Our data shows that short complementary overhangs facilitate efficient helical stacking, opening the possibility of using noncovalent labeling with &#199;m&#8208;modified hairpins in conjunction with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy for structural studies of larger RNAs and RNA&#8208;protein complexes.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of sophisticated spectroscopic probes into RNA often requires an extensive synthetic effort. To minimize that, a noncovalent spin-labeling strategy using spin-labeled hairpins has been developed. The assembly of hairpins containing the rigid spin label &lt;b&gt;&#199;m&lt;/b&gt; with RNA duplexes was monitored by EPR spectroscopy, including PELDOR. Short complementary overhangs facilitated efficient helical stacking.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids is essential for elucidating their complex biological functions. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique to extract such information. However, its application to nucleic acids requires the incorporation of spin labels, usually nitroxides. Rigid spin labels are more informative EPR probes than flexible ones, since they offer high-precision distance measurements and can provide information about the relative orientation of spin labels. However, the synthesis and incorporation of such rigid labels is nontrivial. Here we describe a strategy in which the rigid spin label &lt;b&gt;&#199;m&lt;/b&gt; is incorporated into a small hairpin, which in turn can be used to label several different oligonucleotides noncovalently through helical stacking. We have studied the noncovalent assembly of spin-labeled RNA hairpins with RNA duplexes by both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy, specifically pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called DEER). Our data shows that short complementary overhangs facilitate efficient helical stacking, opening the possibility of using noncovalent labeling with &lt;b&gt;&#199;m&lt;/b&gt;-modified hairpins in conjunction with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy for structural studies of larger RNAs and RNA-protein complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Torsion&#8208;induced &#960;&#8208;conjugation Offers an Approach to Small Coumarin&#8208;based Color&#8208;changing Fluorescent Sensors of Esterase Activity</title>

C4&#8208;coumarin esters enhance the torsional extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, allowing for a fluorescent color&#8208;based distinction between ester and carboxylate species during esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis.








ABSTRACT
Fluorescent sensors for esterase activity include a diverse array of compounds that utilize intramolecular charge transfer induced by the unmasking of the electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl group through esterase action. These sensors exhibit different outcomes, ranging from turn&#8208;on fluorescence to fluorescence color changes. In this work, we demonstrate the application of torsion&#8208;induced fluorescence changes in designing esterase&#8208;dependent chemosensors. We present a method for detecting esterase activity based on the torsion&#8208;induced geometrical changes between the ester and carboxylate forms of a fluorophore. Our approach shows that aligning electronic interactions between the C7 heteroatom and the C4 ester substituents within a small coumarin core stabilizes the planar geometry of the coumarin ester, leading to fluorescence emission above 570&#160;nm. Upon esterase&#8208;mediated hydrolysis, the coumarin exhibits a blue shift in emission to 460&#160;nm, corresponding to the carboxylate form. This shift occurs due to the nonplanar orientation of the carbonyl relative to the fluorophore. As a result, C4&#8208;coumarin ester emissions can be observed in the red fluorescence channel, while carboxylate emissions are detected in the blue/green fluorescence channels. Consequently, we introduce small, highly permeable aryl and acetoxymethyl coumarin esters as indicators of esterase activity and as tools to differentiate between live and dead cells.

         <title>Modulating the Optoelectronic Properties of Tripodal Fluorophores Through Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Peripheral Phenyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A)3 fluorophores featuring central triphenylamine donor, polarizable 2,5&#8208;divinylthiophene linker, and a broad portfolio of fluorine&#8208;based substituents show tunable (non)linear optical properties.








ABSTRACT
Fourteen novel tripodal fluorophores based on a central triphenylamine donor, electron&#8208;rich, and polarizable divinylthiophene linker, and eight different fluorine&#8208;based substituents have been designed and prepared via a straightforward four&#8208;step sequence. Altering the peripheral F&#8208;substitution has been demonstrated to largely affect their fundamental properties such as thermal robustness (210&#8211;420 &#176;C), the LUMO energies (ELUMO = &#8722;2.35 to &#8722;3.11&#160;eV), the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (&#916;E = 2.07&#8211;2.66&#160;eV), and the absorption/emission maxima (&#955;maxA/E = 442&#8211;478/521&#8211;678&#160;nm). The experimental data, corroborated by DFT calculations, further revealed twofold and tunable ICT employing both central triphenylamine and auxiliary thiophene donors, and the peripheral F&#8208;substitution either boosting or switching&#8208;off two&#8208;photon absorption activity. Whereas the &#9472;SF5 groups impart an exceptional cross&#8208;section of 1930 GM, the &#9472;COCF3 group may completely suppress the nonlinear optical response.

         <title>Systematic Comparison of Homogeneous Catalyst Recycling Strategies: Organic Solvent Nanofiltration vs. Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Multiphase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key performance metrics, including hexene conversion rates and catalyst leaching, were evaluated over extended continuous operation periods. Results demonstrated that the OSN method significantly outperformed the multiphasic system, maintaining hexene conversion at 83% after 76 h compared to a decline to 72% in the multiphasic setup after 36 h. Furthermore, catalyst leaching was substantially lower in the OSN system, at below 0.1&#160;ppm during continuous operation an order of magnitude less than the competing multiphasic approach.








ABSTRACT
This study presents a systematic comparison of two recycling strategies for molecular catalyst&#8212;multiphasic catalyst recycling and organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN)&#8212;within a unified reaction system. Molecular catalyzed reactions are vital in chemical production, necessitating efficient recycling of costly catalyst metals. To facilitate a fair comparison, a versatile model reaction system was developed that allows for both monophasic and multiphasic configurations while preserving the integrity of the central hydroformylation process, converting 1&#8208;hexene and CO/H2 syngas to heptanal in both cases.

         <title>Construction of Phospholipid&#8208;Like Vesicles by Aqueous Aminolysis of Acyl Thioesters With Diamino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells via enzymatic diacylation. Here, we show that direct aminolysis of acyl thioesters with diamino acids in aqueous environments enables the synthesis of diacylated amino acids (DAAAs), which spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust phospholipid&#8208;like vesicles across a broad range of pH and temperature.








ABSTRACT
Membrane&#8208;forming phospholipids are produced in cells by enzymatic diacylation of polar head groups. However, analogous nonenzymatic processes remain both challenging and limited in scope. Moreover, the restricted variety of canonical lipid head groups constrains the properties and functions of phospholipid membranes. Therefore, the development of chemical methodologies for the straightforward preparation of versatile membrane&#8208;forming building blocks is highly valuable. Here, we describe a simple strategy for the aqueous synthesis of phospholipid&#8208;like molecules via direct aminolysis between diamino acids and water&#8208;soluble acyl thioesters. In the presence of imidazole, diamino acids (i.e., diaminopropionic acid, ornithine, lysine) undergo rapid N&#8208;diacylation to yield amphiphilic diacylated amino acids (DAAAs). These amino acid&#8208;lipid conjugates spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into robust micron&#8208;sized vesicular structures capable of encapsulating hydrophilic cargos across a wide pH and temperature range. Our findings highlight the potential of amino acid&#8208;based lipids as modular, functional building blocks for generating tunable membranous systems in aqueous environments.

         <title>Development of tCAP(N3): Affinity Peptide&#8208;Aided, pH&#8208;Triggered Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Native IgG Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tCAP(N3) reagent, featuring a stable and self&#8208;activating precursor, enables site&#8208;specific conjugation of native IgGs. This Fc&#8208;affinity peptide approach selectively transfers an Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly payload to Lys248, producing divalently azidated antibody while preserving its biological function. The incorporated azide groups serve as handles for efficient click chemistry with DBCO&#8208;functionalized payloads, yielding well&#8208;defined ADCs.








ABSTRACT
Direct modification of native antibodies with affinity peptides remains a significant challenge, primarily because the affinity peptide often stays bound to the antibody and blocks its interaction with key receptors. In this study, we developed tCAP(N3), a novel traceless chemical conjugation method that employs an affinity peptide. tCAP(N3) can be stored for over a year at refrigerated temperature, as it contains an active ester precursor that can be spontaneously activated under neutral conditions. When tCAP(N3) was mixed with a target native IgG, Ac&#8208;Lys(N3)&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly was site&#8208;selectively transferred onto Lys248, yielding divalently azidated IgG that can be further modified with DBCO compounds. The resulting antibody conjugates retained Fc receptor binding and antigen recognition comparable to the parent IgG.

&lt;p&gt;The tCAP(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) reagent, featuring a stable and self-activating precursor, enables site-specific conjugation of native IgGs. This Fc-affinity peptide approach selectively transfers an Ac-Lys(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-Gly-Gly payload to Lys248, producing divalently azidated antibody while preserving its biological function. The incorporated azide groups serve as handles for efficient click chemistry with DBCO-functionalized payloads, yielding well-defined ADCs.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Based on Formate Decomposition With Bio/Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution from formate with a hybrid system of enzyme, donor&#8208;acceptor linked photocatalyst&#8208;cyclodextrin complex (Mes&#8208;Acr+&#8208;CD) and platinum nanoparticle is reported. The use of CD as a dispersant for Mes&#8208;Acr+ is a perfect strategy to enhance photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution without deactivation of the enzyme. This work also reveals that ring size and substituents of CD could influence hydrogen production in the system significantly.








ABSTRACT
Formic acid is an attractive hydrogen carrier in terms of hydrogen capacity and safety. Focusing on hydrogen release from formic acid, the developments of catalysts with easy controllability in mild conditions have been desirable. Previous study reported a hybrid catalytic system of enzymes, photosensitizers, and metal nanoparticles for controllable hydrogen production with visible light. However, methyl viologen, which is a toxic compound, was utilized as an electron mediator from photosensitizers to metal nanoparticles. 9&#8208;Mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methyl acridinium (Mes&#8208;Acr+) is one of the promising candidates which hold a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state for the removal of methyl viologen from the hybrid system to enhance the safety and the catalytic activity. In this work, cyclodextrins (CDs) were employed to form a complex with Mes&#8208;Acr+ using supramolecular interactions such as ionic and hydrophobic interactions, which improved photocatalytic activity in aqueous solution. This supramolecular photocatalyst was finally applied to photocatalytic hydrogen production with a system of formate dehydrogenase, NAD+, Mes&#8208;Acr+, CD, and colloidal platinum nanoparticles dispersed by polyvinylpyrrolidone. An ultimate yield from formate to hydrogen reached 24% at pH 6.0, indicating a rate&#8208;determining step would be electron transfer from Mes&#8208;Acr radical to Pt&#8208;PVP to reduce protons.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupled to Formate Fermentation: An Electro&#8208;Bio Cascade Approach in Biocompatible Electrolytes</title>

CO2 utilization in industrial biotechnology: Rational design of a process cascade for electrochemical CO2 reduction linked with formate fermentation, supporting robust cell growth and high biomass yields.








ABSTRACT
Integration of electrochemical CO2 reduction with microbial fermentation enables conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals but poses challenges at the electrolysis&#8208;fermentation interface. The electrolyte must ensure efficient CO2 reduction while remaining compatible with microbial growth. We investigated various electrolytes for coupling CO2 electroreduction to formate with formate fermentation by Methylorubrum&#160;extorquens TK&#160;0001. Electrolyte performance was evaluated by formate production and microbial growth. A phosphate&#8208;based buffer demonstrated the best overall compatibility. Optimal microbial growth occurred at 0.1&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi, with tolerance of up to 111&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 formate. Continuous CO2 electrolysis in 1.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 KPi produced 2.0&#160;mol L&#8722;1 formate in 48 h. Formate fermentation with M.&#160;extorquens showed biomass yield of 107&#160;mg CDW gformate&#8722;1 and a growth rate of 0.10 h&#8722;1. These results highlight the crucial role of buffer composition and concentration in balancing efficient CO2 electroreduction with stable fermentation. Optimizing this electrochemical&#8211;biological interface enables direct utilization of CO2&#8208;derived formate as a substrate for sustainable microbial production, offering a promising scalable route for industrial biotechnology.

         <title>Fluorescent Diarylethenes With Polar Groups: Synthesis, Spectra, and Optical Microscopy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blinking green and flashing red: photo&#8208;switchable and photo&#8208;activatable probes emitting green and red light were prepared and applied as bioconjugates in super&#8208;resolution optical microscopy.








ABSTRACT
The use of photoactivatable fluorescent diarylethenes (fDAEs) in biology&#8208;related light microscopy has been restricted by the lack of probes having freely variable structural and spectral properties. Facing these challenges, we synthesized &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fDAEs with four hydroxyl groups and a single functionality in the core structure (HO&#8208;fDAEs). HO&#8208;fDAEs emit green light; they were used for the preparation of cell&#8208;permeant mitochondrion&#8208;selective probes and bioconjugation with proteins (via a single COOH group). HO&#8208;fDAEs were combined in bio&#8208;imaging with a thiophene&#8208;substituted fDAE (Th&#8208;fDAE) possessing red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission bands of the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. Th&#8208;fDAE undergoes full on&#8208;switching with 405&#160;nm and excitation with green light (&lt; 560&#160;nm). The large Stokes shifts of HO&#8208;and Th&#8208;fDAE (80 and 110&#160;nm, respectively) and different excitation wavelengths permitted color separation in optical microscopy. Photoactivation of HO&#8208;fDAEs and transient on&#8208;off switching (blinking) of Th&#8208;fDAE made it possible to acquire two&#8208;color images of cellular structures with optical superresolution.

         <title>How Do Charge States Affect Ammonia Coordination in Superatomic Niobium Clusters?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how cluster charge states regulate ammonia coordination on superatomic niobium clusters, illustrating a superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mechanism.








ABSTRACT
Atomically precise metal clusters have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties, which make them promising for advanced materials and catalytic applications. A fundamental understanding of metal cluster&#8208;ligand interactions is crucial for developing efficient cluster&#8208;based catalysts and functional materials. In this study, we show that Nbn+ and Nbn&#8722; clusters exhibit charge&#8208;dependent reactivity with NH3, resulting in prominent coordination products including Nb7(NH3)7+, Nb7(NH3)2&#8722;, Nb8(NH3)8+, and Nb8(NH3)4&#8722;. Using DFT calculations, we uncovered the critical role of cluster charge states and Lewis&#8208;acid sites in determining reactivity and the formation of complex products. Furthermore, we elucidated the superatom&#8208;&#963; coordination mode and the stability mechanism of these complexes. This study offers new insights into coordination chemistry and provides a foundation for rational design of new materials via metal cluster complexes.

         <title>Dearomative Vinylation of Indoles via Multicomponent Photoredox Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Heteroarene Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Dearomative addition reactions of indoles represent a prominent strategy for the synthesis of practically valuable indolines. However, implementing this approach typically requires prefunctionalization of the indole precursor with specific groups (e.g., alkynes, alkenes, or ketones) to facilitate the subsequent cyclization&#8208;dearomatization step. In this work, we report a three&#8208;component, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;mediated dearomative vinylation of indoles that circumvents the need for preinstalling reactive fragments into the indole scaffold. The developed photoredox&#8208;catalyzed thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;heteroarene reaction employs Boc&#8208;protected indole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as effective terminating agents for the radical cascade.

         <title>Asynchronous Reaction Toward Hierarchical Crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical crosslinking network structures through asynchronous reactions based on the difference in reactivity of functional groups enable the realization of topologically customizable polyurea ionogels. This Concept explores the impact of network structure on the mechanical properties, hysteresis, and multifunctionality of polymer ionogels, offering a pathway for advanced flexible iontronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Ionogels have emerged as promising materials in soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining performance and enabling diverse applications. Refining the network architectures of ionogels through chemical design is a promising strategy. This Concept article summarizes our recent progress in the design of polymeric ionogel networks. Our methodology exploits the pronounced disparity in chemical reactivity among functional groups, thereby achieving the spontaneous formation of these hyperbranched clusters through asynchronous reactions. These hyperbranched clusters spontaneously assemble via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby constructing hierarchical cross&#8208;linked polymer networks. This network design endows polyurea ionogels with high strength, exceptional toughness, low hysteresis, and fluorescence. We have summarized the applications of such ionogels in emerging fields, including flexible sensing, electroluminescent devices, and nanogenerators. Finally, the application prospects and future development directions of these materials are discussed. This network design strategy is expected to provide new insights for developing functionalized ionogels.

         <title>Cu(I) Is a Game Changer in the Arrest of Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced ROS Production in the Presence of Competing Zn(II) Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
ROS production due to Cu(amyloid&#8208;&#946;) redox cycling is proposed to contribute to the oxidative stress observed in Alzheimer's disease brains. We previously reported on a nitrogen and sulfur&#8208;containing ligand, L, able to arrest Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;induced ROS production [Chem. Eur. J. 2023, 29,]. In the present study, the intricate mechanism by which L maintains its protective activity in the presence of Zn, an abundant endogenous metal ion found in the synaptic cleft, is disentangled with the use of complementary spectroscopic and analytical investigations. This mechanism, which we refer to as kinetic Cu(I) shunt, relies on a faster Cu(I) than Zn transfer from Cu,Zn(A&#946;) to L, followed by a fast re&#8208;oxidation of Cu(I)(L) to Cu(II)(L), which is redox&#8208;inert (i.e. resistant against reduction from ascorbate). This study hence provides new insights into the kinetic involvement of Cu(I) ions in the inhibition of Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;associated ROS production in presence of Zn.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Au(I)&#8208;Aryl Complexes Through Mild Base&#8208;Assisted Transmetallation of Arylboronic Acids: Scope and Limitations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method based on the use of aqueous ammonia&#8208;assisted transmetallation permits access to various [Au(I)(NHC)(Aryl)] complexes using mild reagents, desirable solvents and ambient reaction conditions.








ABSTRACT
A resurgence of research surrounding Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes has led to sustainable methods toward their synthesis, as well as to the expansion of their scope and applications in catalysis, biology, and materials chemistry. The availability of mild synthetic methodologies has facilitated the design and development of Au(I)&#8208;Aryl architectures suitable for specific photonic applications, such as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) and Room Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) emitters. The development and application of reliable synthetic methods have increased, yet several synthetic aspects remain to be uncovered. Herein, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I)&#8208;Aryl complexes through mild, base&#8208;assisted transmetallation of arylboronic acids is further explored, targeting Au(I)&#8208;Aryl structures incorporating polyaromatic and triarylborane frameworks, and structural features of relevance to organometallic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, and luminescence. In addition to the utilization of K2CO3 as the mild, cost&#8208;effective base of choice, we introduce the use of aqueous ammonia as a novel tool that facilitates transmetallation to gold. The purpose of additional exploration is to discover limitations of the synthetic methods, as well as inherent flaws regarding the design of [Au(NHC)(Ar)] (Ar = Aryl) complexes. Previously undiscovered synthetic limitations are disclosed, along with practical alternatives.

         <title>Hierarchical Manganese&#8208;Doped ZIFs Heterostructure Electrocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67/ZIF&#8208;L heterostructure undergoes in situ electrochemical reconstruction into a highly active (Co, Mn)OOH phase, providing abundant catalytic sites and fast charge transfer. The reconstructed catalyst enables efficient methanol oxidation with superior durability while simultaneously achieving energy&#8208;saving hydrogen co&#8208;production.








ABSTRACT
The development of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is essential to promote the hydrogen energy technology. However, most of the electrocatalysts currently used for MOR have drawbacks, such as inefficient reaction kinetics, low tolerance to carbon monoxide poisoning, and unstable performance. Herein, we report a novel hierarchical MOF heterostructure that is made up of Mn&#8208;doped ZIF67 and Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L) directly grown on carbon cloth to highly enhance the MOR performance. Such heterostructure integrates flake&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;L with Mn&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 nanocrystals, forming a porous core&#8208;shell framework with abundant active sites and enhanced charge transportation. More interesting, the Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L experiences dynamic reconstruction (Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac) that partial phases in CoMn LDHs are transformed into (Co,Mn)OOH during the electrochemical operation in which further boosting the catalytic performance and stability. The electrochemical results demonstrate that Mn&#8208;ZIF67/L&#8208;ac remarkably improves the MOR performance with the much lower potential of 1.359&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial RuO2. The electrocatalyst also delivers the high MOR stability of &#8764;97% retention after 130&#160;h. This work demonstrates a robust strategy for nonnoble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts and an efficient route to hydrogen production through MOR&#8208;HER coupling.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: This review systematically summarizes the design strategies, reaction mechanisms, and application prospects of OSEs, highlighting their potential for sustainable energy conversion and as alternatives to noble metal catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Organic semiconductor electrocatalysts (OSEs), which integrate the properties of organic semiconductors with electrocatalytic performance, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional noble metal catalysts due to their low cost, earth abundance, and design flexibility. This article reviews the unique structural features of organic material systems, including small organic molecules, conjugated polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic hybrid materials. It elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the features of organic catalysts and their catalytic advantages. It discusses design strategies, including molecular engineering and interface regulation. Also, it explores applications in key reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Despite challenges in stability and large&#8208;scale preparation, OSEs show great potential in sustainable energy conversion, offering insights for advancing clean energy technologies.

         <title>Controlled Generation of &#946;&#8208;NiOOH by Sulfuric Acid Treatment Enables Active and Durable Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conceptual illustration of surface activation and reversible regeneration in H2SO4&#8208;treated Ni foam. Sulfuric&#8208;acid treatment introduces surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites while embedding a subsurface &#946;/&#947;&#8208;NiOOH reservoir. During electrochemical cycling, this buried phase acts as a structural memory that enables reversible reconstruction of the active &#946;&#8208;NiOOH layer, ensuring sustained oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and durability.








ABSTRACT
Designing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts that can reversibly operate as both oxidation and reduction electrodes is key to developing efficient and rechargeable electrochemical energy systems. However, the evolution of nickel active sites between hydroxide and oxyhydroxide phases, and how such transformations can be made reversible under dynamic operating conditions, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced surface oxidation strategy that enables both the controlled formation and reversible regeneration of &#946;&#8208;NiOOH active sites on free&#8208;standing nickel foam electrodes. Moderate H2SO4 treatment (1&#160;M) produces an optimized electrode (1.0&#8208;Ni) exhibiting superior OER performance, requiring overpotentials (&#951;) of only 218, 348, and 458&#160;mV at 10, 500, and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The enhanced activity originates from sulfuric&#8208;acid&#8208;induced modulation of Ni sites, which promotes &#946;&#8208;NiOOH formation as the catalytically active phase while maintaining structural integrity. Moreover, a buried &#946;&#8208;NiOOH&#8208;rich layer serves as a structural&#8208;memory reservoir, allowing reversible reconstruction of surface &#946;&#8208;NiOOH during redox cycling. This reversible behavior enables the same electrode to function as both anode and cathode, relevant to rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery and other bifunctional electrochemical systems. The dual mechanism acid&#8208;induced active&#8208;site formation and electrochemical regeneration thus provides a scalable strategy for constructing reversible, heteroatom&#8208;free nickel electrodes for sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>An Artificial Interphase of Ionic Liquid (EMIMTFSI) for High Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries face short lifetimes caused by Zn dendrites and corrosion. Here, a versatile ionic liquid interphase is formed by tape&#8208;casting EMIMTFSI on Zn (IL@Zn). The enriched EMIM+ and TFSI&#8722; on the Zn surface form an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; phase and a hydrophobic interface, uniform nucleation is effectively promoted and corrosion is suppressed. As a result, IL@ Zn&#8208;I2 batteries retain 82% capacity after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries suffer from short cycle life due to zinc (Zn) dendrite growth and polyiodide shuttle&#8208;induced corrosion. To address these key challenges, a multifunctional protective film of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMIMTFSI) ionic liquid, denoted as IL@Zn, was constructed on the Zn anode surface via a tape&#8208;casting method to improve the cycle life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. EMIM+ cations preferentially adsorb on Zn, creating a water&#8208;lean inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and providing steric hindrance for uniform Zn nucleation, while hydrophobic TFSI&#8722; anions enrich at the surface to build a water&#8208;repellent interface that excludes H2O and suppresses parasitic reactions. Moreover, EMIM+ hinders iodine dissolution and forms an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; dominant phase, mitigating the polyiodide shuttle and the associated Zn corrosion. Consequently, IL@Zn symmetric cells deliver over 350&#160;h of stable cycling at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with IL@Zn anodes retain 82% capacity after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit higher Coulombic efficiency (CE) after self&#8208;discharge than cells with unprotected Zn anodes. This work demonstrates a facile strategy for aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries that effectively addresses the challenges of dendrite formation and the shuttle effect.

         <title>Controlling Competitive Radical Pathways: Insights from Aryl Diazonium Electrografting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work&#160;shows that nitrobenzene diazonium electrografting results from competition between aryl and diazenyl radicals, which govern film composition. Using simulations and control strategies, grafting conditions are tuned to favor specific radicals. It enables selective formation of azo&#8208;enriched films and paves the way toward the precise control of nanofilm structure.








ABSTRACT
Understanding and controlling the reactivity of radical species remains a major challenge in many chemical reactions, with the goal of steering and precisely tuning key processes. Recognized as a simple and efficient method for the preparation of 2D nanomaterials, diazonium electrografting is a prime example of a functionalization technique that still requires deeper mastery to meet the demands of future bottom&#8208;up approaches. In this work, supported by multiphysics simulations, we achieve an unprecedented understanding of the grafting mechanism involved in nitrobenzene diazonium electrografting and its impact on the resulting nanofilm composition. It is demonstrated that film growth arises from a competition between aryl and diazenyl radicals, leading to the incorporation of variable amounts of azo&#8208;bridged nitrophenyl units. By implementing control strategies using radical scavengers and redox inhibitors, corroborated by simulations, we show that diazenyl radicals are preferentially grafted at the substrate/film interface rather than within the film structure itself. Finally, we demonstrate that selective trapping of aryl radicals over diazenyl radicals enables the formation of azo&#8208;enriched films, thus opening the way for precise tuning of film composition and selective radical reactivity.

         <title>A Riboflavin&#8208;Derived Flavinium Salt Mediates Chemoselective Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;component methylation protocol was developed, where the active flavin mediator can be recycled in a single step. Crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy support the mechanistic proposal, while chemoselective methylation was observed for a broad range of biologically relevant substrates.








ABSTRACT
Selective methylation is among the most relevant transformations in synthetic chemistry and the discovery of new drug molecules. A methyl group is typically installed using strong electrophiles such as methyl iodide or dimethyl sulfate, which are associated with safety hazards and limited chemoselectivity. A promising strategy for circumventing these limitations relies on splitting the methylation into a two&#8208;step procedure under mediator control. However, such reactions, including the Mukaiyama redox condensation, currently lack applicability since the mediator is lost as organic waste, resulting in a low atom economy. We have developed a flavin&#8208;mediated methylation strategy with easily accessible methyl diphenylphosphinite (Ph2POMe) as the source of the methyl group. The flavin mediator is easily recovered by a simple acidic treatment followed by oxidation with air. Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies and structural information by X&#8208;ray crystallography paint a clear mechanistic picture, while we show the chemoselective modification of a variety of organic substrates and also demonstrate trideuteromethylation. Methylation is accomplished with complex molecules, including venetoclax and nevirapine. We envision the flavin&#8208;mediated methodology to be adaptable to other alkylation reactions besides methylation. Within the realm of the latter, chemoselective modification of nucleobases stands out as a promising target.

We have developed a flavin-mediated methylation strategy with easily accessible methyl diphenylphosphinite (Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;POMe) as the source of the methyl group. The flavin mediator is easily recovered by a simple acidic treatment followed by oxidation with air. Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies and structural information by X-ray crystallography paint a clear mechanistic picture, while we show the chemoselective modification of a variety of organic substrates and also demonstrate trideuteromethylation. Methylation is accomplished with complex molecules, including venetoclax and nevirapine. We envision the flavin-mediated methodology to be adaptable to other alkylation reactions besides methylation. Within the realm of the latter, chemoselective modification of nucleobases stands out as a promising target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Formation of a Formally Cu(III) Trifluoromethyl Hydroxide Tetramer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide scaffold with an unprecedented heterocubane structure was synthesized. Its neutralization reactions with acids afford a broad variety of Cu(III) complexes with two trifluoromethyl groups. Synthetic relevance of this compound for C&#9472;CF3 bond formation was demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
Aerobic copper&#8208;mediated oxidative processes play a pivotal role in the context of enzymatic oxidation and catalysis. Herein, the first high&#8208;valent copper(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide with the tetrameric heterocubane structure [Cu(CF3)2(OH)]4 was synthesized by air oxidation of copper(I) in the presence of TMSCF3/KF and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. This unique compound displays versatile reactivity, functioning as a hydroxide base in neutralization reactions with acids, which affords a broad variety of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) complexes with two trifluoromethyl groups. The synthetic relevance of copper(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide for boronic acid trifluoromethylation was demonstrated. The natural population analysis (NPA) charge distribution in the tetrameric heterocubane was studied by DFT calculations, which support the experimentally observed behavior of this compound as a weak hydroxide base, and revealed the positive NPA charge of +1.157 on high&#8208;valent copper.

         <title>Conformational Trajectory of the Molecular Chameleon Grazoprevir from Formulation to Target&#8208;Bound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
Macrocycles represent a promising class of beyond&#8208;rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 (bRo5) therapeutics, capable of targeting proteins traditionally considered undruggable by conventional small molecules. Macrocycles exhibit intrinsic flexibility and often display a &#8220;chameleon&#8208;like&#8221; ability to adapt to their environment, thereby enhancing their oral bioavailability. Describing their structures and conformational changes is essential for advancing their development in the bRo5 space. In this study, we present the novel solid&#8208; and solution&#8208;state structures of the macrocycle grazoprevir, determined using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A low&#8208;energy core conformation was consistently identified throughout the conformational journey, from solid formulation to solvated states and upon complexation with the biological target, while the vinyl cyclopropyl sulfonamide side chain reoriented. The presence of a common core conformation (RMSD up to 0.273 &#197;) suggests that grazoprevir adopts a partial pre&#8208;organized state, optimizing its suitability for target binding. In apolar environment, mimicking the cell membrane, intramolecular hydrogen bonding promoted the formation of compact conformations with reduced radii of gyration and solvent accessible 3D polar surface area, likely facilitating cell permeability. This work presents a comprehensive conformational trajectory of a macrocyclic chameleon and provides potential insights into understanding and characterizing cell permeability and chameleonicity of similar bRo5 therapeutics.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Allenes From sec&#8208;Propargyl Alcohols and Their Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first alkaline earth catalyst&#8208;mediated synthesis of trisubstituted allenes from sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols with active methylene compounds or electron&#8208;rich arenes. The reaction demonstrates its sustainability not only due to the use of a Ca&#8208;catalyst, but also due to its simple operation, at room temperature, under solvent&#8208;free, open&#8208;air conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;pot synthetic applications, and a wide substrate scope were demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
We describe here the first report on the alkaline earth&#8208;catalyzed regioselective synthesis of trisubstituted allenes from sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols (PAs) and active methyl ketones/electron&#8208;rich arenes. Unlike previous methods, the current approach does not require the protection of alcohol, heating, transition metal catalysts, or solvents. The reaction mechanism is proposed based on deuterium labelling, step&#8208;wise synthesis, and isolation of intermediates. The current protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high reaction yields, and enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Besides, we also demonstrated the one&#8208;pot cyclization of these allenes to obtain tetrahydroindoles and fused furans.

A photoinduced, regio&#8208; and chemoselective &#947;&#8208;alkylation of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans with a&#8208;bromoketones was achieved by exploiting a photoredox catalytic process promoted by blue light. This approach provides practical and efficient access to chiral, &#949;&#8208;ketobutenolides, in one step and high yields. The usefulness of these scaffolds as versatile platforms to access complex, heterobicyclic molecules via late&#8208;stage modifications was also demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
&#947;&#8208;Butenolides are widespread structural motifs found in many natural and unnatural products which display an impressive range of biological activities. Among them, &#949;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butenolides represent underestimated butenolide frameworks, which could serve as valuable platforms to build complex structures, for example, heterobicyclic derivatives. Quite unexpectedly, despite the apparent simplicity of their structures, efficient synthetic methodologies enabling the construction of chiral, &#949;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butenolide architectures are quite underdeveloped. In this context, herein we present a novel, photoinduced regio&#8208; and chemoselective &#947;&#8208;alkylation of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans with 2&#8208;bromoketones providing a practical access to &#949;&#8208;ketobutenolide scaffolds in racemic format, in one single step and high yields. The usefulness of these products as starting materials to build chiral, fused&#8208;heterobicycle lactone derivatives was demonstrated by the implementation of a two&#8208;step strategy which successfully delivered unprecedented phenyltetrahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;b]furan&#8208;2(3H)&#8208;one and tetrahydrofuro[3,2&#8208;c]pyridazin&#8208;6(1H)&#8208;one chemotypes.

         <title>Stepwise and Cascade Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Diaroylphenanthrenes From Tetraarylthiophenes by Electronically Guided Bond Making and Breaking under a Scholl&#8208;Type Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electronically programmable Scholl&#8208;type protocol transforms tetraarylthiophenes through selective [c]&#8208;face annulation to phenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, which then undergo oxidative C&#9472;S cleavage to 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. A one&#8208;pot cascade integrates both steps, unveiling unprecedented thiophene bond&#8208;making/bond&#8208;breaking dual&#8208;reactivity and providing streamlined access to &#960;&#8208;extended, edge&#8208;edited aromatic frameworks relevant for advanced materials.








ABSTRACT
The Scholl reaction has long stood as a powerful tool for forging C&#8211;C bonds in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yet controlling regioselectivity and accessing new reactivity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we unveil a strategically designed platform that exploits electronic tuning within tetraarylthiophenes (TATs) to achieve highly selective [c]&#8208;face oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, delivering phenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes in exceptional yields, a pathway previously inaccessible. Beyond annulation, we uncover a novel oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, wherein these phenanthrothiophenes undergo selective C&#9472;S bond cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes&#8212;a transformation unprecedented in thiophene chemistry under Scholl&#8208;type reaction. Remarkably, we integrate both steps into a one&#8208;pot cascade protocol, streamlining direct synthesis from TATs to complex diketone architectures in notable yields. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and EPR spectroscopy, point out toward radical (cation/anion) pathways governing these transformations. This dual reactivity&#8212;from ring construction to ring cleavage&#8212;spotlights new horizons in Scholl chemistry, expanding synthetic access to diverse PAH frameworks and edition of functional edges, that may have potential applications as functional materials in organic electronics.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scholl reaction has long stood as a powerful tool for forging C&#8211;C bonds in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yet controlling regioselectivity and accessing new reactivity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we unveil a strategically designed platform that exploits electronic tuning within tetraarylthiophenes (TATs) to achieve highly selective [&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]-face oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, delivering phenanthro[9,10-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]thiophenes in exceptional yields, a pathway previously inaccessible. Beyond annulation, we uncover a novel oxidative ring-opening reaction, wherein these phenanthrothiophenes undergo selective C&#9472;S bond cleavage to yield 9,10-diaroylphenanthrenes&#8212;a transformation unprecedented in thiophene chemistry under Scholl-type reaction. Remarkably, we integrate both steps into a one-pot cascade protocol, streamlining direct synthesis from TATs to complex diketone architectures in notable yields. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and EPR spectroscopy, point out toward radical (cation/anion) pathways governing these transformations. This dual reactivity&#8212;from ring construction to ring cleavage&#8212;spotlights new horizons in Scholl chemistry, expanding synthetic access to diverse PAH frameworks and edition of functional edges, that may have potential applications as functional materials in organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Thio&#8208;MacMillan Organocatalysts: Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions or Sacrificial Self&#8208;Cyclization to N&#8208;Bridged Bicyclic Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>
The study of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cinnamaldehyde and cyclopentadiene, catalyzed by chiral imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones, led to the discovery of a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective Michael&#8208;addition and consecutive ring closure. Here, the imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione not only catalytically activates cinnamaldehyde but also participates as the nucleophile to form a complex N&#8208;bridged bicyclic system, as elucidated by DFT calculations.








ABSTRACT
Chiral secondary amines in lactams are commonly used as chiral organocatalysts (MacMillan catalysts) in a broad range of transformations. The related thiolactam derivatives are less explored although possessing some significantly differing properties originating from the stereoelectronic characteristics of sulfur. In the present study, we present a streamlined synthesis and application of imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones from naturally abundant L&#8208;phenylalanine. Suitable substituents enable asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high enantioselectivity and yield. Here, we discovered the formation of a novel bicyclic thiolactam aldehyde motif in absence of the diene. The obtained hetero&#8208;bicycle, with four consecutive stereocenters, is formed in high yield and stereoselectivity from imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione and two cinnamaldehyde units, whereas the first gen. MacMillan catalyst shows no reactivity. We propose a mechanism of formation which is supported by DFT calculations, revealing a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic factors for the observed selectivity. Our results demonstrate the surprising versatility of imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones, as this compound class can not only engage as a catalyst but can simultaneously participate as a reagent to form complex structures. The hetero&#8208;bicyclic skeleton is accessible in a single step and allows for facile structural modifications.

         <title>APE1 Activity is Controlled by Non&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Conformations in Single&#8208; and Double&#8208;Stranded G&#8208;Quadruplex Constructs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) folding in DNA is inhibitory to AP endonuclease, although the protein still binds well to G4s. Curiously, partially folded G&#8208;rich sequences, possibly transient hairpins, containing AP are very good substrates for cleavage by APE1. Herein, the enzyme activity and G4 folding are studied in single&#8208;stranded vs. duplex contexts.








ABSTRACT
Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8208;1 (APE1) is a repair enzyme that efficiently cleaves abasic (AP) site damage in duplex DNA. Reports of in vitro activity assays between APE1 and single&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (ssG4) reveal significant decreases in the endonuclease activity. Here, we identify that the low yields observed represent cleavage of the noncanonical folds that did not adopt a complete G4 fold. This conclusion is supported through circular dichroism analysis and activity assays analyzing the cleavage rate, folding impact on cleavage, and product inhibition. Studies were performed on AP&#8208;containing ssG4 and duplex&#8208;embedded G4 scaffolds. The CD spectra of a non&#8208;G4 containing potential quadruplex sequence reveal a noncanonical structure. APE1 can cleave an AP in these non&#8208;G4 conformation(s) in high yields comparable to the preferred duplex substrate. There is direct evidence of decreasing APE1 activity with increasing G4 folding in ssG4 and duplex&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex (DGD) systems. Also observed is a positional dependency on yield in the non&#8208;G4 DGD scaffolds, but not in the non&#8208;G4 ssG4 scaffolds. In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that APE1 efficiently cleaves noncanonical conformations in G4&#8208;like structures, highlighting the control of secondary structure on APE1 endonuclease activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorocycloparaphenylenes via Macrocyclic Pd Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) were synthesized through a novel approach involving the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes. The thermally stable macrocyclic Pd complexes, followed by ligand exchange with Xantphos, afforded various F&#8208;CPPs incorporating tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. Optical measurements combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations revealed size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.








ABSTRACT
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) are strained, cyclic, &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with unique electronic and supramolecular properties. Here, we report a novel synthetic approach to create F&#8208;CPPs via the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes that contain covalent Pd&#8211;C bonds. The thermal stability of the fluorinated biaryl Pd motifs and the reversibility of the formation of Pd&#8211;C bonds enable the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic Pd complexes. Subsequent ligand exchange with Xantphos facilitates reductive elimination, yielding various F&#8208;CPPs that incorporate tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. A structural analysis revealed that the thienylene&#8208;based F&#8208;CPPs adopt tubular packing structures due to their high fluorine content. Optical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations demonstrated size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission behavior. This Pd&#8208;mediated synthetic strategy provides a new platform for the synthesis of functionalized CPPs with tailored properties for potential applications in nanomaterials and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Magnetic Dynamics and Elongated Coherence of a High&#8208;Spin Mn(II) Qubit Doped into a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that dilute Mn(II) (&#8764;0.02 mol%) doped into the Zn(II)&#8208;MOF [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3] act as high&#8208;spin (S = 5/2) spin qubits, achieving microsecond phase memory times above 50 K&#8212;the first report for Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks suppress relaxation and stabilize the lattice, extending T2. Resonance between MS = &#177;1/2 and quantization axis tilting reveal tunable spin dynamics, highlighting MOFs as promising platforms for high&#8208;spin molecular qubits.








ABSTRACT
Spin qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing and sensing technologies. Their potential to function even at elevated temperatures makes them particularly attractive for future devices. However, while extensive studies have been carried out on S = 1/2 systems, high&#8208;spin complexes remain much less explored as spin qubit platforms. In this study, we prepared a Zn(II)&#8208;based MOF, [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3], doped with trace amounts of Mn(II) ions (S = 5/2, 0.2, and 0.02 mol%). Magnetic measurements under static fields revealed slow relaxation phenomena dominated by direct and Raman&#8208;like processes. Importantly, Q&#8208;band pulsed ESR confirmed quantum coherence between MS = &#177;1/2 sublevels, achieving phase memory times (T2) up to 5.4 &#181;s at 10 K, which is significantly longer than those reported in other Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Rabi nutation experiments verified coherent spin control and multilevel transitions, while Wigner matrix analysis revealed reorientation of the nuclear quantization axis during spin flips. Notably, coherence persisted above 150 K, attributed to the stabilization provided in the MOF's hydrogen&#8208;bonded lattice. This work represents the first demonstration of high&#8208;spin Mn(II) qubits with measurable coherence at elevated temperatures, underscoring MOFs as versatile and tunable platforms for advancing quantum materials and molecular spin&#8208;based technologies.

Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions. Enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering; these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions&#8208;mediated strategies. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modifications to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.








ABSTRACT
Chemical modification of RNA can endow RNA molecules with novel structures and functions, enabling broader clinical application potential. RNA chemical modification is a systematic and controllable engineering approach, particularly at the cellular or tissue level, requiring precise modification strategies to reduce off&#8208;target effects and enhance spatiotemporal controllability. Although enzyme&#8208;and light&#8208;mediated chemical modifications are widely employed for RNA engineering, these strategies are hindered by the complex enzymatic environment within cells and the low light penetration. This review summarizes the field of chemical RNA modifications using diverse approaches, including enzyme, light, and synthetic reactions mediated strategies, such as nucleotide incorporation, light&#8208;induced RNA silencing, bioorthogonal RNA modification, post&#8208;transcriptional modification, and deprotection. By introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various RNA modification strategies, this review provides a reference for designing and developing novel RNA modification to achieve efficient, precise, and spatiotemporally specific RNA modification strategies.

         <title>Photo and Ultrasound Facilitated the Release of Nitric Oxide from [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] Isomers: Synthesis, Cytotoxicity, DNA Binding, and Theoretical Simulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] enantiomers were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. The molecular orbitals and spectra of these isomers were assigned using DFT calculations. Both the photo and the ultrasound facilitate the release of NO from complexes in solution. The complexes induce apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, binding with CT&#8208;DNA in the order: D1&gt; D2&gt; L1&gt; L2.








ABSTRACT
Four isomers of [Ru(NO)(QnCN)(Pro)Cl] (L1, D1, L2, and D2) were synthesized, where QnCN is 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile and Pro is L&#8208; or D&#8208; proline. Complexes L1 and D1, L2 and D2 are two pairs of Ru&#8208;centered enantiomers. In L1 and D1, the proline is coordinated trans to NO, whereas in L2 and D2 the 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarbonitrile is coordinated trans to NO. The electronic absorption spectra, infrared (IR), and Raman spectra of the isomers were experimentally measured and theoretically assigned. Ultrasound induces the release of NO from the complexes in solution more rapidly, with a shorter t1/2 than light does. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the isomeric complexes against HeLa cells was evaluated; the IC50 values range from 1 to 10 &#181;M, with selectivity indices exceeding 2.8. The complexes induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Molecular docking analyses have revealed that the complexes interact with DNA via minor groove binding. The unique stereochemical configurations of the four complexes affect their selective binding to CT&#8208;DNA, with DNA binding affinities at 298 K in the following order: D1 &gt; D2 &gt; L1 &gt; L2. This study offers insights into the potential applications of these isomeric nitrosylruthenium complexes.

         <title>Interpenetrating Polymer Network Eutectogels Derived From Polymerizable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Low&#8208;Temperature Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel IPN eutectogel fabricated from polymerizable deep eutectic solvent exhibits a freezing point below &#8722;57&#176;C. It integrates high ionic conductivity, robust mechanical properties, and remarkable flexibility, enabling supercapacitors to operate reliably under bending, damage, and extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions down to &#8722;30&#176;C.








ABSTRACT
This study developed a polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) system composed of H2O, choline chloride, and acrylic acid, which exhibited a freezing point as low as &#8211;57.2&#160;&#176;C. By introducing sodium acetate and carrying out in situ polymerization within a polyacrylamide hydrogel, a high&#8208;performance eutectogel with an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure was constructed. The optimized IPN eutectogel demonstrates outstanding overall properties, including high mechanical strength (tensile stress up to 97.2&#160;kPa) and toughness (fracture elongation of 235%), while maintaining high ionic conductivity (21.4&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#176;C) across a broad temperature range (&#8211;40 to 60&#176;C). Supercapacitors using this eutectogel operate effectively within a 1.2&#160;V voltage window and exhibit ideal electric double&#8208;layer capacitive behavior. They achieve a maximum energy density of 7.10&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, retain 80% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, and show stable performance under bending, damage, and low&#8208;temperature (&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C) conditions. These results underscore the material's strong potential for use in flexible and low&#8208;temperature energy storage devices.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Density Redistribution Facilitates Aggregation in PNNP Dicopper Hydride Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I) hydride complexes often exhibit diverse aggregation behavior that can profoundly influence their structure and reactivity. In this study we use a combined experimental and computational approach to identify key structural an electronic factors that govern aggregation in PNNP dicopperhydride complexes.








ABSTRACT
Copper(I) hydride complexes often exhibit diverse aggregation behavior that can profoundly influence their structure and reactivity. In this study, we investigate a series of dicopper hydride complexes supported by PNNP expanded pincer ligands that vary in both aggregation and ligand protonation state. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we examine how these properties correlate and identify key structural and electronic factors that govern aggregation. Our analysis shows that electrostatic stabilization is reduced in charged monomers relative to the neutral system, making dimerization less favorable. At the same time, protonation of the ligands redistributes electron density at the hydride&#8208;bridged dicopper core, lowering interfragment overlap of occupied orbitals, which facilitates dimer formation in more protonated species. These results highlight the importance of ligand&#8208;controlled electronic structure in dictating the aggregation behavior of copper hydride complexes.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Tetralactam Macrocycles: Protonation&#8208;Activated Convergent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles with embedded pyridinedicarboxamide switches undergo reversible protonation&#8208;triggered reorganization to toggle between low&#8208; and high&#8208;affinity binding states. The protonated form exhibits &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold enhanced binding for BrIBr&#8722; via convergent hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.








ABSTRACT
Integrating high binding affinity with dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive control represents a pivotal objective in synthetic receptor design, with far&#8208;reaching implications for sensing, separation, and molecular machinery. We report a class of shape&#8208;shifting tetralactam macrocycles featuring embedded 2,4&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide units as switching elements. In their neutral state, these macrocycles adopt divergent hydrogen&#8208;bonding conformations that exhibit low substrate affinity. Upon protonation, a reversible conformational reorganization occurs, reorienting four amide N&#8211;H groups toward the cavity to form a convergent, high&#8208;affinity hydrogen&#8208;bonding pocket. Conformational switching was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution&#8208;phase NMR. Upon protonation, these macrocycles exhibit &gt;10&#8309;&#8208;fold binding enhancement, achieving association constants up to 135,000 M&#8722;1 for the polyhalide anion BrIBr&#8722;. Computational analysis reveals that this dramatic increase arises from synergistic hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and van der Waals interactions.

     alt="Shape-Shifting Tetralactam Macrocycles: Protonation-Activated Convergent Hydrogen Bonding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shape-shifting tetralactam macrocycles with embedded pyridinedicarboxamide switches undergo reversible protonation-triggered reorganization to toggle between low- and high-affinity binding states. The protonated form exhibits &amp;gt;10&#8309;-fold enhanced binding for BrIBr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; via convergent hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating high binding affinity with dynamic, stimuli-responsive control represents a pivotal objective in synthetic receptor design, with far-reaching implications for sensing, separation, and molecular machinery. We report a class of shape-shifting tetralactam macrocycles featuring embedded 2,4-pyridinedicarboxamide units as switching elements. In their neutral state, these macrocycles adopt divergent hydrogen-bonding conformations that exhibit low substrate affinity. Upon protonation, a reversible conformational reorganization occurs, reorienting four amide N&#8211;H groups toward the cavity to form a convergent, high-affinity hydrogen-bonding pocket. Conformational switching was confirmed by X-ray crystallography and solution-phase NMR. Upon protonation, these macrocycles exhibit &amp;gt;10&#8309;-fold binding enhancement, achieving association constants up to 135,000 M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the polyhalide anion BrIBr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Computational analysis reveals that this dramatic increase arises from synergistic hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a robust strategy for designing adaptive hydrogen-bonding receptors that combine dynamic switching with high substrate affinity and selectivity. The ability to toggle between low- and high-affinity states without sacrificing structural integrity sets the stage for expanding the scope of smart molecular systems with tunable recognition properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We present a new class of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes incorporating an electron&#8208;rich 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand profoundly alters the redox and photophysical properties, enabling protonation&#8208;controlled excited&#8208;state switching and chloride binding. These results highlight bpy&#8208;NHI as a versatile platform for tunable Ir(III) photosensitizers.








ABSTRACT
We report the design, synthesis, and comprehensive photophysical characterization of a new class of heteroleptic IrIII complexes featuring a strongly electron&#8208;donating 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic imine)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;NHI) ligand. The bpy&#8208;NHI ligand was synthesized on a multigram scale via a seven&#8208;step sequence and fully characterized. Reaction with the dimer [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 afforded the target complex [Ir(ppy)2(bpy&#8208;NHI)]+, whose electronic structure was probed by (spectro)electrochemistry as well as by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Compared to the parent [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ complex, the new complex exhibits a significantly altered redox profile, including a novel irreversible oxidation at 0.4&#160;V vs Fc+/Fc and the absence of the typical bpy&#8208;centered reduction, consistent with the strongly electron&#8208;donating nature of the NHI substituents. The high basicity of the NHI substituents enabled modulation of the excited&#8208;state properties via protonation, leading to unusual excited&#8208;state dynamics where the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer state switches between bpy&#8208; and ppy&#8208;based character. In the protonated form, the complex is able to bind chloride ions, which was qualitatively detected by changes in the ground&#8208;state absorption of the complex. These findings establish bpy&#8208;NHI as a powerful and sensitive electron&#8208;rich ligand platform for modulating the photophysical and electrochemical properties of Ir(III) complexes, opening new opportunities for the design of photosensitizers with tailored excited&#8208;state properties.

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: An Emerging Concept for Amine Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While protecting groups are indispensable in total synthesis to avoid undesired reactivity, installation and removal of protecting groups lead to an increase in the step&#8208;count, cost, waste production and time requirement. One approach tackling these drawbacks is deprotective functionalization, which combines deprotection and postfunctionalization in a single step, utilizing the protecting group to activate the functional group for further transformations.








Abstract
Protecting groups are widely employed in multi&#8208;step syntheses with the goal to downregulate the reactivity of certain functional groups. Their use, while often unavoidable, comes with notable drawbacks including increased costs and waste, as well as typically adding two (nonstrategic) synthetic steps to a given sequence. Moreover, late&#8208;stage deprotection of highly functionalized compounds can pose challenges. We introduced an approach termed deprotective functionalization, allowing for direct conversion of a protected functional group into a new one without requiring a separate deprotection event. Interestingly, in this paradigm the protecting group not only prevents side reactions, but also primes the protected functionality for selective transformations. This article provides a conceptual framework for this approach and discusses related strategies, currently limited to protected amines.
