         <dc:description>
A highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole) bearing branched flexible chains that stabilize a room&#8208;temperature columnar hexagonal phase is reported for the first time. With balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility, it has a high extinction coefficient, a small optical band gap and a wide absorption range.







Abstract
A new series of highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole)s bearing branched flexible chains stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase and with balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility is reported for the first time. Only the anti isomer was successfully separated and characterized. These compounds have a high extinction coefficient, small optical band gap and wide absorption range, thus making them a promising class of ambipolar organic semiconductors capable of self&#8208;organizing.

         <title>Chemical Tailoring of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Adsorption from Drinking Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets by amino&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;CD) through different sized alkyl linkers (Cn) is presented. The adsorption properties of GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD materials toward perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS, is studied by combined experimental tests and molecular dynamic simulations allowing deep understanding of the relationships between molecular structure and the adsorption performance.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD) modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, having different sized alkyl linkers (GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#946;CD) and their exploitation as sorbent of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from drinking water. &#946;CD were functionalized with a pending amino group, and the resulting precursors grafted to GO nanosheets by epoxide ring opening reaction. Loading of &#946;CD units in the range 12&#8201;%&#8211;36&#8201;% was estimated by combined XPS and elemental analysis. Adsorption tests on perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), a particularly persistent PFAS selected as case study, revealed a strong influence of the alkyl linker length on the adsorption efficiency, with the hexyl linker derivative GO&#8208;C6&#8208;&#946;CD outperforming both pristine GO and granular activated carbon (GAC), the standard sorbent benchmark. Molecular dynamic simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules retention.

         <title>(Bio)Functionalisation of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra by Using Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I)&#8208;catalysed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click chemistry is a versatile post&#8208;synthetic tool to functionalize the surface chemistry of alkyne&#8208;functionalized cuboctahedral Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs). This methodology enables quantitative functionalization of MOPs with a wide range of functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids and biomolecules.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) is crucial to their physicochemical properties because it governs how they interact with external substances such as solvents, synthetic organic molecules, metal ions, and even biomolecules. Consequently, the advancement of synthetic methods that facilitate the incorporation of diverse functional groups onto MOP surfaces will significantly broaden the range of properties and potential applications for MOPs. This study describes the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalysed, azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reactions to post&#8208;synthetically modify the surface of alkyne&#8208;functionalised cuboctahedral MOPs. To this end, a novel Rh(II)&#8208;based MOP with 24 available surface alkyne groups was synthesised. Each of the 24 alkyne groups on the surface of the &#8220;clickable&#8221; Rh&#8208;MOP can react with azide&#8208;containing molecules at room temperature, without compromising the integrity of the MOP. The wide substrate catalogue and orthogonal nature of CuAAC click chemistry was exploited to densely functionalise MOPs with diverse functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids, and even biotin moieties, which retained their recognition capabilities once anchored onto the surface of the MOP.

         <title>Encapsulation in Charged Droplets Generates Distorted Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of various hydrogen&#8208;bonded resorcinarene&#8208;based capsules to bind &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkylbisDABCOnium (DnD) guests of different lengths was investigated in solution and in the gas phase. While no host&#8208;guest interactions were detected in solution, encapsulation could be achieved in the charged droplets formed during electrospray ionisation (ESI). This included guests which are far too long in their most stable conformation to fit inside the cavity of the capsules. A combination of three mass spectrometric techniques, collision&#8208;induced dissociation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry together with computational modelling allow us to determine the binding mode of the DnD guests inside the cavity of the capsules. Significant distortions of the guest into horseshoe&#8208;like arrangements are required to optimise cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with the host which also adopt distorted geometries with partially open hydrogen&#8208;bonding seams when binding longer guests. Such quasi &#8220;spring&#8208;loaded&#8221; capsules can form in the charged droplets during the ESI process as there is no competition between guest encapsulation and ion pair formation with the counterions that preclude encapsulation in solution. The encapsulation complexes are sufficiently stable in the gas phase &#8211; even when strained &#8211; because non&#8208;covalent interactions significantly strengthen in the absence of solvent.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ring translocation switches and shuttles featuring a macrocycle (or a ring molecule) navigating between two or more stations continue to attract attention. While the vast majority of these systems are developed in organic solvents, the cucurbituril (CB) macrocycles are ideally suited to prepare such systems in water. Indeed, their stability and their relatively high affinity for relevant guest molecules are key attributes toward translating the progresses made in organic solvents, into water. In this concept article, we summarize the findings, key advances and multiple possibilities offered by CBs toward advanced molecular switches and shuttles in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(arylene iminoborane)s, Analogues of Poly(arylene vinylene) with a BN&#8208;Doped Backbone: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great success of the concept of doping organic compounds with BN units to access new materials with tailored prop&#173;erties, its use in polymer chemistry has only been realized quite re&#173;cently. Herein, we present a comprehensive study of oligo&#8208; and poly&#173;(arylene iminoborane)s comprising a back&#173;bone of phenylene or thio&#173;phene moieties, as well as combinations thereof, linked via B=N units. The novel polymers can be regarded as BN analogues of poly&#173;(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) or poly(thiophene vinylene) (PTV) or their copolymers, respectively. Our modular syn&#173;thetic approach al&#173;lowed us to prepare four polymers and twelve monodisperse oligo&#173;mers with modulated electronic properties. Alter&#173;nating electron&#8208;re&#173;leasing di&#173;aminoarylene and electron&#8208;accepting dibo&#173;rylarylene building blocks give rise to a pronounced donor&#8211;acceptor character. Effective &#960;&#8208;con&#173;ju&#173;ga&#173;tion over the arylene iminoborane back&#173;bone is evidenced by sys&#173;tematic bathochromic shifts of the low&#8208;energy UV&#8208;vis absorp&#173;tion max&#173;imum with increasing chain length, which is furthermore sup&#173;ported by crystallographic and compu&#173;tational investigations. Further&#173;more, all compounds investigated show emission of visible light in the solid state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to the presence of partially flexible linear B=N linkages in the back&#173;bone.</dc:description>

         <title>An Investigation of Allyl&#8208;Substituted&#160;Bis(Diphosphine) Iron Complexes: Towards Precursors for Cooperative CO2 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In developing homogenous catalysts capable of CO2&#160;activation, interaction with a metal center is often imperative. This work provides our primary efforts towards the cooperative activation of CO2&#160;using a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere (SCS) and iron via a paired theoretical/experimental approach. Specifically, we report efforts towards [Fe(diphosphine)2(N2)] as a CO2&#8208;coordinated synthon where diphosphine =&#160;1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;cyclohexylboraneyl)propylphosphino)ethane) (P2BCy4) or its precursor,&#160;tetrakisallyldiphosphinoethane (tape). Initial efforts toward the {Fe(0)&#8208;N2} complex were focused on deprotonation reactions of [Fe(diphosphine)2(H)(NCCH3)]+&#160;and reduction of [Fe(tape)2Cl2]. In the latter case, a mixture of intramolecularly p&#8208;bonded alkene and associated metallacyclic Fe(II)&#8212;H species were produced &#8211; heating this mixture provided the hydride as the major product. Notably, the interconversion of this pair counters that of related intermolecular reactions between [Fe(depe)2] (depe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) and ethylene, where hydride formation occurs subsequent to p&#8208;coordination; this has been probed by theoretical calculations. Finally, reactivity of the metallacyclic {Fe(II)&#8212;H} complex with CO2&#160;was probed, resulting in a pair of isomeric ferra(II)lactones.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Formation of Electroactive Graphene&#8208;Based Cementitious Composites: Towards Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of composites combining multiple components each one imparting a specific function to the ensemble is highly sought after for disruptive applications in chemistry and materials science, with a particular importance for the realization of smart structures. Here we report on the development of an unprecedented multifunctional cementitious composite incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO).&#160;By design, this material features enhanced electrical properties while retaining the excellent cement&#8217;s hydration and microstructure.The multiscale investigation on the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the dispersion allowed to establish an efficient preparation protocol for rGO aqueous dispersion as well as rGO&#8208;based cementitious composites using a commercial poly(carboxylate ether)&#8208;based superplasticizer. Conduction mechanisms within the matrix of rGO containing mortars were unraveled by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealing conductive paths originating from bulk cement matrix and rGO nanosheets in composites with rGO loadings as low as 0.075wt.%. For this rGO loading, we observed the reduction of the resistivity of bulk cement mortar layers from 18.3M&#937;&#160;cm to 2.8M&#937;&#160;cm. Moreover, the addition of 0.2wt.% of rGO resulted in the formation of rGO conductive paths with resistivity of 51.1k&#937;&#160;cm. These findings represent a major step forward towards the application of graphene in structural health monitoring of concrete structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Dyads and Triads of Boron Difluoride Formazanate and Boron Difluoride Dipyrromethene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dye&#8208;dye conjugates have attracted significant interest for their utility in applications such as bioimaging, theranostics, and light&#8208;harvesting. Many classes of organic dyes have been employed in this regard; however, building blocks don&#8217;t typically extend beyond small chromophores. This can lead to minor changes to the optoelectronic properties of the original dye. The exploration of dye&#8211;dye structures is impeded by long synthetic routes, incompatible synthetic conditions, or a mismatch of the desired properties. Here, we present the first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind dye&#8208;dye conjugates of boron difluoride complexes of formazanate and dipyrromethene ligands. These conjugates exhibit dual photoluminescence bands that reach the near&#8208;infrared spectral region and implicate anti&#8208;Kasha processes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed the generation of polyanionic species that can reversibly tolerate the uptake of up to 6 electrons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that BF2 formazanates can serve as a synthetically accessible platform to build upon new classes &#160;of dye&#8208;dye conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Interrelations between Linkage Isomers of an Efficient Square&#8208;planar Nickel(II) Nitrite Photoswitch in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch, with the 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyimino&#8208;3&#8208;[(2&#8217;&#8208;dimethylamino)ethyl]imino&#8208;1&#8208;propanone moiety used as the ancillary ligand, is reported. In the ground&#8208;state (&#8216;dark&#8217;) crystal structure, the studied compound exists predominantly as the nitro&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;N(O)2) isomer, however, traces of the exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;nitrito&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;ONO) forms are detected both at 100 K (4&#8722;5% each) and under ambient conditions (~9% each). When excited with the 405&#8722;530 nm LED light, the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization takes place. The total conversion exceeds 90%. The exo&#8208;nitrito linkage isomer constitutes the dominant photo&#8208;generated form, whereas the relative population of both nitrito species depends on temperature. The reaction is fully reversible and reproducible. The photo&#8208;products are stable up to 200 K. The system constitutes a good model case for the reaction mechanism studies. Thus, experimental and theoretical investigations on the photo&#8208;isomerism were conducted and are presented in detail. Eventually, the nitro &#8594; exo&#8208;nitrito &#8594; endo&#8208;nitrito reaction pathway is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Electronic Nature of Rh&#8208;basedPaddlewheel Catalysts from 103Rh NMRChemical Shifts: Insights from QuantumMechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tremendous importance of dirhodium paddlewheel com&#8208;plexes for asymmetric catalysis is largely the result of anempirical optimization of the chiral ligand sphere aboutthe bimetallic core. Only recently, a H(C)Rhtriple resonance 103Rh NMR experiment provided the long&#8208;awaited opportunity to examine &#8211; with previously incon&#8208;ceivable accuracy &#8211; how variation of the ligands impacts onthe electronic structure of such catalysts. The recorded ef&#8208;fects are dramatic: formal replacement of one out ofeight O&#8208;atoms in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N&#8208;atom results in a shielding of thecorresponding Rh&#8208;site of no less than 1000 ppm. The cur&#8208;rent paper provides the framework that allowsthis and related experimental observations made with a setof 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted.In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that theshielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of theequatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis.Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shield&#8208;ing but exert an electronic cis&#8208;effect that onto the neighboring equatorial sites. Furthermore, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic trans&#8208;effect of ligands ofdifferent donor strengths is reflected in the 103 Rh NMR shifts.</dc:description>

The recorded ef-fects are dramatic: formal replacement of one out ofeight O-atoms in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N-atom results in a shielding of thecorresponding Rh-site of no less than 1000 ppm. The cur-rent paper provides the framework that allowsthis and related experimental observations made with a setof 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted.In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that theshielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of theequatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis.Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shield-ing but exert an electronic cis-effect that onto the neighboring equatorial sites. Furthermore, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic trans-effect of ligands ofdifferent donor strengths is reflected in the 103 Rh NMR shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitchable Azoheteroarene&#8208;Based Chelating Ligands: Light Modulation of Properties, Aqueous Solubility and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based chelation&#8208;type ligands were designed and a detailed evaluation of the light&#8208;modulated changes in their properties were carried out. The photo&#8208;induced enhancement of solubility of one of the azopyrazole&#8208;based ligands enabled its utilization in modulation of catalytic activity of CuAAC reaction in water.







Abstract
We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based molecular systems as chelation&#8208;type light&#8208;controllable ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light&#8208;tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility, especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized towards controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.

         <title>Boosting the Cell Performance of the SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy Anodes via In&#8208;Situ Reduction/Oxidation Coating Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon monoxide (SiO) has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity as an alternative material for conventional graphite anode, but its poor electrical conductivity and irreversible side reactions at the SiO/electrolyte interface seriously reduce its cycling stability. Here, to overcome the drawbacks, the dicharged SiO anode coated with Cu coating layer is elaborately designed by in&#8208;situ reduction method. Compared with the pristine SiO anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery (293 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), the obtained SiO/Cu composite presents superior cycling stability (1206 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). The tight combination of Cu particles and SiO significantly improves the conductivity of the composite, effectively inhibits the side&#8208;reaction between the active material and electrolyte. In addition, polypyrrole&#8208;coated SiO composites are further prepared by in&#8208;situ oxidation method, which delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1311 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles. The in&#8208;situ coating strategies in this work provide a new pathway for the development and practical application of high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode.</dc:description>

Abstract
Nuclear industry spent fuel reprocessing and some radioactive contamination sites often involve high acidity and salinity environments. Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8722; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5&#8197;min) and good sorption capacity (388&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.

&#946;&#8208;Glucopyranoside, as a modulator, successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates and modulated the ternary co&#8208;assembly to form hierarchically chiral leaves. By substituting highly similar polyoxometalates, the accurate balance between short&#8208; and long&#8208;range interactions is demonstrated to be the key to the formation of chiral hierarchical microstructures.







Abstract
Hierarchical chiral structures have broad applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, and biological systems. The delicate balance of various interactions are key to the self&#8208;assembly of chiral structures. Herein, a ternary co&#8208;assembly consisting of cationic pillar[5]arenes (P5As), anionic &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside (&#946;GlcD/&#946;GlcL), and Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) were constructed. Through adjusting the stoichiometry of &#946;GlcD, the assemblies were effectively controlled to form hierarchical nano&#8208;leaf assemblies with twisted nanoribbons in a homochiral direction. The co&#8208;assemblies exhibit strong Cotton effects, and successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type POMs. More interestingly, by changing the central metal in Anderson&#8208;type POMs (XMo6O243&#8722; (X=Cr, Al, and Ga)), even though the three clusters have the same numbers of charge and size, the hierarchical chirality of the related assemblies varied in the morphology of the assemblies and the Cotton effect in the CD spectra. Results in theoretical calculations and ITC titration indicates that the tiny difference in long&#8208;range electrostatic interaction would result in the anion recognition of POMs, modulated by &#946;GlcD through host&#8211;guest inclusion and hydrogen bonding in the assembly process.

         <title>Structural Insight on Supramolecular Polyion Salts: Inositol Hexaphosphate Enclosed in Cationic Macrocyclic Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate (depicted by the turtle), is an important bioanion that plays multiple roles in metabolic processes. Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, resulting in insight to its intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. Results indicate that an axial phosphate and proton interchange play important structural roles with changing environment.







Abstract
Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate, a key bioanion with multiple roles in metabolic processes. Due to the complex chemistry of six multivalent phosphates surrounding the small, cyclic inositol framework, crystallographic information of simple phytate salts has been elusive. This report represents a combined crystallographic, theoretical, and solution binding investigation of a supramolecular macrocyclic complex of phytate. Together, the results provide significant insight to phytate's intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. The macrocycle&#8208;phytate aggregates consist of phytate anionic pairs, each partly sandwiched by two 24&#8208;membered, amide/amine&#8208;based cationic macrocycles. The phytate ion pairs hold the tetrameric macrocyclic array together by six strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both phytates crystallize in 1a5e phosphate conformations (one axial (P2) and five equatorial phosphates). Solution NMR binding studies in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 DMSO&#8208;d6&#8201;:&#8201;D2O indicate 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 macrocycle:phytate associations, suggesting that the sandwich&#8208;like nature of the complex holds together in solution. DFT studies indicate the likely occurrence of dynamic intramolecular interchange of phosphate protons, as well as important roles for the axial (P2) phosphate in both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Regime Switch in the Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Silicates with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallophotoredox catalyzed coupling of an aryl bromide with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate can lead to the formation of large quantity of side products when subjected to high intensity/high frequency irradiation. Two regimes were found to be possible; the ability to switch from the quantitative coupling to the simultaneous coupling and degradation of the silicate was observed.







Abstract
Metallaphotoredox catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of an arylbromide (Ar&#8722;Br) with an alkyl bis(catecholato)silicate (R&#8722;Si&#8854;) has been analyzed in depth using a continuum of analytical techniques (EPR, fluorine NMR, electrochemistry, photophysics) and modeling (micro&#8208;kinetics and DFT calculations). These studies converged on the impact of four control parameters consisting in the initial concentrations of the iridium photocatalyst ([Ir]0), nickel precatalyst ([Ni]0) and silicate ([R&#8722;Si&#8854;]0) as well as light intensity I0 for an efficient reaction between Ar&#8722;Br and R&#8722;Si&#8854;. More precisely, two regimes were found to be possibly at play. The first one relies on an equimolar consumption of Ar&#8722;Br with R&#8722;Si&#8854; smoothly leading to Ar&#8722;R, with no side&#8208;product from R&#8722;Si&#8854; and a second one in which R&#8722;Si&#8854; is simultaneously coupled to Ar&#8722;Br and degraded to R&#8722;H. This integrative approach could serve as a case study for the investigation of other metallaphotoredox catalysis manifolds of synthetic significance.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) have potential for delivering organotin(IV) compounds in cancer therapy due to their water solubility, stability, non&#8208;toxicity, and photoluminescence. Two nanosystems were developed by grafting organotin fragments and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid onto NGQDs. In vitro tests demonstrated high cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and minimal effects on non&#8208;cancer cells (HEK293T), with successful uptake and release of the metallodrug in cancer cells.







Abstract
The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in&#8197;vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).

         <title>Erythronium Bonds: Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group&#8197;5 Elements as Electron&#8208;Density Acceptors
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the term erythronium bond (EyB) is proposed to name an attractive noncovalent interaction between any electrophilic element of group&#8197;5 and electron&#8208;rich atoms (Lewis bases or anions).







Abstract
Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level, atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules, natural bond orbital studies) prove the formation of net attractive noncovalent interactions between group&#8197;5 elements and electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). These kinds of bonding are markedly different from coordination bonds formed by the same elements and possess the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term erythronium bond is proposed to denote these bonds. X&#8208;ray structures of vanadate&#8208;dependent bromoperoxidases show that these interactions are present also in biological systems.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, the term &lt;i&gt;erythronium bond&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;EyB&lt;/i&gt;) is proposed to name an attractive noncovalent interaction between any electrophilic element of group&#8197;5 and electron-rich atoms (Lewis bases or anions).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical calculations (PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP level, atoms-in-molecules, natural bond orbital studies) prove the formation of net attractive noncovalent interactions between group&#8197;5 elements and electron-rich atoms (neutral or anionic). These kinds of bonding are markedly different from coordination bonds formed by the same elements and possess the distinctive features of &#963;-hole interactions. The term &lt;i&gt;erythronium bond&lt;/i&gt; is proposed to denote these bonds. X-ray structures of vanadate-dependent bromoperoxidases show that these interactions are present also in biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Inverted Ligand Field in the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Octahedral Formal Platinum (IV) Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure of octahedral platinum complexes with halogens or chalcogens was revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field. The formal IV platinum oxidation state was in no case supported except in combination with oxygen and fluorine. A new interpretation of the oxidative addition process was also provided.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the inverted ligand field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8722;F and Pt&#8722;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the density of states plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8722;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the inverted ligand field.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular Michael Addition by In Situ Generated Aminoisobenzofulvenes: Construction of Spiro Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we described organocatalytic spirocyclization of keto&#8208;enone tethered enals via a reductive Michael/aldol condensation/Michael domino sequence. This method granted us access to the architecturally complex spirocyclic spiroindene&#8208;2&#8208;caboxaldehyde frameworks with excellent selectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and good to moderate yields. Formation of aminoisobenzofulvenes was a key intermediate for intramolecular Michael addition as final spirocyclization step.







Abstract
An unprecedented enantioselective organocatalytic spirocyclization strategy is presented by in&#8197;situ generation of aminoisobezofulvenes. The reaction sequence involves a reductive Michael/aldol&#8208;condensation/Michael addition cascade by iminium&#8208;enamine catalysis. The key success of this spirocyclization was the formation of intermediatory nucleophilic aminoisobenzofuvenes accountable for intramolecular Michael addition. Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline&#8208;derived amino&#8208;organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, and 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Post&#8208;methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.

         <title>Dual Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions for the Conformational Control of Urea
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction has been developed as a means of establishing conformational control in sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing ureas. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives adopt a planar structure bearing an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement (X=S, Se). The rigidity of the structure and the acidity were found to increase in the order benzothiophene&lt;benzoselenophene ureas.







Abstract
Dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed as a novel means for the conformational control of urea derivatives. The formation of a chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction at both sides of the urea carbonyl group was unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as computational studies including non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) plot index analysis, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis, and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis via DFT calculations. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives that bear chalcogen atoms (X=S and Se) adopt a planar structure via the carbonyl oxygen (O) with an X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X arrangement on the same side of the molecule. The rigidity of the conformational lock was evaluated using the molecular arrangement in the crystal and the rotational barrier of benzochalcogenophene ring, which indicated a stronger conformational lock in benzoselenophene than in benzothiophene urea derivatives. Furthermore, the acidity of the urea derivatives increases according to the Lewis&#8208;acidic properties of the chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions, whereby benzoselenophene urea is more acidic than benzothiophene urea. Tweezer&#8208;shaped urea derivatives were prepared, and their stereostructure proved the viability of the conformational control for defining the location of the substituents on the urea framework.

         <title>2,4,5,7&#8208;Tetranitrofluorenone Oximate for the Naked&#8208;Eye Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donors and the Chiroptical Sensing of Enantiopure Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solutions of 2,4,5,7&#8208;tetranitrofluorenone oximate (1) are blue (&#955;max&#8776;600&#8197;nm) in aprotic solvents, independently of polarity, while a red color (&#955;max&lt;560&#8197;nm) is obtained in protic solvents. The hypsochromic shift in absorption is in excellent correlation with the H&#8208;bond donating ability (&#945;) of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). [3]Helical, configurationally labile, 1 is further applied in recognition of enantiopure HBDs that induced electronic circular dichroism (ECD) upon complexation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding greatly influences rates and equilibrium positions of chemical reactions, conformations, and sometimes even stereochemistry. This study reports on tetranitrofluorenone oximate, a novel dye capable of naked&#8208;eye detection of hydrogen&#8208;bond donating species (HBDs) and of rapid determination of H&#8208;bond donation strength by hypsochromic shift monitoring. In addition, the molecule possesses atropisomeric conformations, of M and P configuration, as evidenced in solid and solution state studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD), respectively. In the latter case, enantiopure bis&#8208;thioureas were the most effective HBDs to promote a chiral induction (diastereoselective recognition, Pfeiffer effect); the ECD results being rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on these experiments, bis&#8208;thioureas were used as chiral reagents in asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of structurally&#8208;related nitrones; the ECD sensing of the stereoinduction between bis&#8208;thioureas and the oximate serving as an indirect method of selection of the most effective HBD for asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Controlled Method for the Regioselective Functionalization of Anilines over Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of anilines in the presence of aliphatic amines is illustrated utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction. Further, the defined principles of reactivity are shown to be broadly extended to other electrophiles.







Abstract
Regioselective transformations at similar functional groups are of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Traditional strategies towards regioselective functionalization include serial protection/deprotection and sequential synthesis. Modern organic synthesis emphasizes pathway efficiency and protecting group free routes with a goal of exploiting inherent differences in reactivity. This study reports a method for the regioselective functionalization of anilines over aliphatic amines. Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8208;Mills reaction, anilines were shown to react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, this principle of reactivity was extended to other electrophiles and conditions.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 grown on nickel mesh by electrodeposition for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly excellent and stable catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually pivotal for clean energy development. In this work, a heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 (Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1) was developed via simple one&#8208;step electrodeposition onto nickel mesh. The heterogeneous interface structure generates sufficient active sites, significantly improving OER performance with an overpotential of 174 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10), while Tafel slope is only 43.0 mV dec&#8722;1. In particular, Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1 is still able to operate stably at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 for 100 h without obvious potential decay. The oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ was detected by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, proving that the heterogeneous catalyst could stabilize the high&#8208;valence state of nickel as active sites to its superior OER performance. This work provides a convenient synthetic strategy for&#160;forming heterogeneous catalysts toward efficient water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks as Tailor&#8208;Made Scaffolds for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing materials to harvest water from the air is of great importance to alleviate the water shortage for people living in arid regions, where the annual average relative humidity (RH) is lower than 0.4. In this work, we report a general nitrogen atom incorporation strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for water harvesting from the air in arid areas. A series of COFs, namely COF&#8208;W1, COF&#8208;W2, and COF&#8208;W3 were developed for this purpose. Different contents of nitrogen were embedded into COFs by incorporating pyridine units into the building blocks. With the increasing content of nitrogen from COF&#8208;W1 to COF&#8208;W3, the inflection points of water isotherms shift distinctly from RH values from 0.65 to 0.25. Significantly, COF&#8208;W3 exhibits the lowest inflection point at a low RH value of 0.25 and reaches a high uptake capacity of 0.28 g g&#8208;1&#160;at 25 &#176;C with a low hysteresis loop. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale COF&#8208;W3 retained its high performance, which renders it more attractive in water harvesting. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this nitrogen incorporation strategy to acquire high&#8208;performance COFs as water harvesters in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Bicyclophane&#8208;Based Molecular Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modular synthesis of a series of nanoscale phenylene bicyclophanes with an intraaanular orthogonal pillar is described. The compounds are obtained by a Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling condensation and are characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy as well as in situ scanning tunneling microscopy at the solid/liquid interface of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. In addition, their structures and conformations are supported by quantum chemical calculations, also after adsorption to the substrate. A set of two alkyl chain substitution patterns as well as a combination of both was investigated with respect to their ability to form extended 2D&#8208;crystalline superstructures on graphite. It shows that not the most densely packed surface coverage gives the most stable structure, but the largest number of alkyl chains per molecule determines the structural robustness to alterations at the pillar functionality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>CO2 catalytic hydrogenation to formate was achieved (TONmax = ca. 3800) in the presence of the neutral, halide&#8208;free, coordinatively saturated tris(carbonyl) manganese pincer&#8208;type complex [Mn(PNP)(CO)3], bearing a diarylamido pincer&#8208;type PNP ligand, using DBU as base and LiOTf as Lewis acid additive, under mild reaction conditions (60 bar, 80 &#176;C).

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ru Nanoboxes with a Hexagonal Close&#8208;Packed Structure by Templating with Ag Nanocubes and Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal nanoboxes offer an attractive form of nanomaterials for catalytic applications owing to their open structure and high utilization efficiency of atoms. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of Ag&#8722;Ru core&#8208;shell nanocubes and then Ru nanoboxes with a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure, as well as evaluation of their catalytic activity toward a model hydrogenation reaction. By adding a Ru(acac)3 solution in ethylene glycol (EG) dropwise into a suspension of Ag nanocubes in EG at 170 &#8451;, Ru atoms are generated and deposited onto the entire surface of a nanocube. As the volume of the Ru(III) precursor is increased, Ru atoms are also produced through a galvanic replacement reaction, generating Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes with a hollow interior. The released Ag+ ions are then reduced by EG and deposited back onto the nanocubes. By selectively etching away the remaining Ag with aqueous HNO3, the as&#8208;obtained Ag&#8722;Ru nanocubes are transformed into Ru nanoboxes, whose walls are characterized by an hcp structure and an ultrathin thickness of a few nanometers. Finally, we evaluate the catalytic properties of the Ru nanoboxes with two different wall thicknesses using a model hydrogenation reaction and both samples show excellent performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative (4 + 2) Cycloaddition Reactions of 4&#8208;Vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;Nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative (4 + 2) cycloaddition reaction between 4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanones and 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes has been developed to produce highly valuable, densely functionalized tetrahydroquinolines in moderate to excellent yields with high diastereoselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The optimised protocol tolerates a range of substituted 2&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes, which represent an under&#8208;utilized class of dipolarophile for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cycloadditions. The employed reaction methodology facilitates efficient cycloaddition with both N&#8208;H&#8208; and N&#8208;Ts&#8208;4&#8208;vinylbenzoxazinanone dipole precursors. The stereochemistry of the major and minor diastereomeric (4 + 2) cycloadducts was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. A mechanistic rationale for the high intrinsic diastereoselectivity and preliminary enantioselective experiments are also presented. The tetrahydroquinoline cycloadduct products feature numerous pendant functionalities, including a vinyl handle, an internal alkyne motif and a nitro functionality (which functions as a latent C&#8208;3 nitrogen substituent) for further synthetic manipulations.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Activation with Manganese Tricarbonyl Complexes by an H&#8208;Atom Responsive Benzimidazole Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative route for electrochemical carbon dioxide activation was discovered for a manganese tricarbonyl complex. This complex first undergoes an H&#8208;atom transfer through a non&#8208;innocent ancillary ligand before subsequent reductions towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;a&#8208;Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;b&#8208;Br) (where HL=2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL=1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox&#8208;active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1&#8201;b&#8208;Br. Notably, a one&#8208;electron reduction of 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br yields a structurally characterized H&#8208;bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2&#8201;a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)&#8208;Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H&#8208;atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low&#8208;energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth&#8208;abundant metal complex catalyst.

         <title>Hexakis&#8208;TIPS&#8208;Alkynylated Nonacenes: Persistent and Processible</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble nonacenes are stabilized via triisopropylsilyl&#8208;ethynylation, halogenation and methoxylation. The substitution resulted in the most stable nonacenes to date. Two derivatives were characterized by crystal structure analysis and one derivative is tested as thin&#8208;film transistor material.







Abstract
Four substituted nonacenes were prepared and characterized by UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The compounds are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date &#8211; due to six strategically placed triisopropylsilyl(TIPS)&#8208;ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks in the solid state. In dilute solution their half&#8208;life is 5&#8211;9&#8197;h. Crystal structure analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested in a solution&#8208;processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport (&#956;e=0.007&#8197;cm2/Vs; &#956;h=0.023&#8197;cm2/Vs).

         <title>Synchronous Proton&#8208;Hydride Transfer by a Pyrazole&#8208;Functionalized Protic Mn(I) Complex in Catalytic Alcohol Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protic Mn(I) complex featuring pyrazole functionality was evaluated for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to access benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives.

A series of Mn(I) complexes Mn(L1)(CO)3Br, Mn(L2)(CO)3Br, Mn(L1)(CO)3(OAc) and Mn(L3)(CO)3Br [L1=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, L2=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine, L3=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine] were synthesized and fully characterized. The acid&#8208;base equilibrium between the pyrazole and the pyrazolato forms of Mn(L1)(CO)3Br was studied by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. These complexes are screened as catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of primary alcohols and aromatic diamines for the synthesis of benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives with the release of H2 and H2O as byproducts. The protic complex Mn(L1)(CO)3Br shows the highest catalytic activity for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole derivatives with broad substrate scope, whereas a related complex [Mn(L3)(CO)3Br], which is devoid of the proton responsive &#946;&#8208;NH unit, shows significantly reduced catalytic efficiency validating the crucial role of the &#946;&#8208;NH functionality for the alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. Control experiments, kinetic and deuterated studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synchronous hydride&#8208;proton transfer by the metal&#8208;ligand construct in the alcohol dehydrogenation step.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A protic Mn(I) complex&lt;/b&gt; featuring pyrazole functionality was evaluated for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to access benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives.

         <title>Transition Metal Ions Influence the Performance of Photodetector of Two&#8208;Dimensional CdS Nanoplatelets</title>

The insertion of copper ions inside the two&#8208;dimensional CdS NPLs exhibits bright red photoluminescence and higher performance of photodetectors.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with atomically precise thickness have attracted much research interest due to their inherent photo&#8208;physical properties. In this work, we have synthesized 2D Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs, investigated the charge transfer dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and fabricated an efficient photodetector device. A large Stoke's shifted emission at ~685&#8197;nm with an average lifetime of about ~1.45&#8197;&#956;s is observed in Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs. Slower bleach recovery kinetics leads to large charge carrier separation in Cu&#8208;doped NPLs which is beneficial for photodetector applications. Cu&#8208;doped NPLs&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit high photocurrent, fast response (~120&#8197;ms), ~600&#8197;times higher photoresponsivity, and ~300&#8197;times higher detectivity (~4.1&#215;1013 Jones) than undoped CdS NPLs. These excellent properties of Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs make this material an efficient alternative for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dyotropic Rearrangement of Diarylethenes: Scope, Mechanism, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual light&#8208;induced rearrangement of diarylethenes to products with complex tricyclic DihydroDithiaAcenaphthylene (DDA) core has been discovered by accident in 1999. Based on the data accumulated by 2022, it can be considered as a promising photoreaction that provides access to photo&#8208; and thermally stable colored species (dyes) with interesting properties and a range of applications.







Abstract
Irreversible two&#8208;photon photorearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diarylethenes is a unique process providing access to complex 2a1,5a&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dithiaacenaphthylene (DDA) heterocyclic core. This reaction was serendipitously discovered during studies on photoswitchable diarylethenes and was initially considered as a highly undesired process. However, in recent years, it has been recognized as an efficient photochemical reaction, interesting by itself and as a promising synthetic method for the synthesis of challenging molecules. Herein, we discuss the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in studies on this notable process.

         <title>Modeling Reactivity of Nitrite and Nitrous Acid at a Phenolate Bridged Dizinc(II) Site: Insights into NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide from (in)organic nitrite at zinc(II): Reactions of a dizinc(II) coordination site with organonitrite or nitrous acid (RONO, R=tBu/amyl/H) result in the formation of a dark green colored arene&#8208;NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex. One electron reductive transformation of the NO+ charge&#8208;transfer moiety and zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex towards NO, in the presence of exogenous reductants, have been illustrated.







Abstract
Although nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at various transition metals including Fe and Cu are relatively well explored, examples of such a reaction at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) site are limited. The present report aims to gain insights into the reactivity of nitrite anions, nitrous acid (HONO), and organonitrite (RONO) at a dizinc(II) site. A phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II)&#8208;aqua complex [LHZnII(OH2)]2(ClO4)2 (1H&#8208;Aq, where LH=tridentate N,N,O&#8208;donor monoanionic ligand) is illustrated to react with tBuONO to provide a metastable arene&#8208;nitrosonium charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. UV&#8208;vis, FTIR, multinuclear NMR, and elemental analyses suggests the presence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 arene&#8208;nitrosonium moiety. Furthermore, the reactivity of a structurally characterized zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) with a proton&#8208;source demonstrates HONO reactivity at the dizinc(II) site. Reactivity of both RONO (R=alkyl/H) at the phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II) site provides NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. Subsequently, the reactions of 2H with exogenous reductants (such as ferrocene, thiol, phenol, and catechol) have been illustrated to generate NO. In addition, NO yielding reactivity of [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) in the presence of the above&#8208;mentioned reductants have been compared with the reactions of complex 2H. Thus, this report sheds light on the transformations of NO2&#8722;/RONO (R=alkyl/H) to NO/NO+ at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) coordination motif.

Combinations of diethyl ether&#8208; and carbene&#8208;coordinated diarylberyllium and beryllium dibromide complexes were shown to undergo reversible and irreversible Schlenk&#8208;type redistribution reactions depending on the steric demand of the aryl substituents affording the corresponding arylberyllium bromide complexes.Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;Analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects (Jones and Helling)







Abstract
The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides, are systematically studied. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp; Tip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H3, Tcpp=2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3C6H3, Cyp=c&#8208;C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard&#8208;analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar=Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2=C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.

         <title>Photocaging of Carboxylic Function Bearing Biomolecules by New Thiazole Derived Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on synthesis of a new bright blue&#8208;green fluorophore for targeted delivery of biologically active substances containing a carboxyl group. The resulting hybrids were thoroughly studied to understand their photophysical properties and behavior under various conditions. The mechanism of photorelease of caging molecules were studied. Biological experiments demonstrated their bioavailability and easy penetration into living cells.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of a new fluorophore containing an arylidene thiazole scaffold resulted in a compound with good photophysical characteristics. Furthermore, the thiazole C5&#8208;methyl group was easily modified into specific functional groups (CH2Br and CH2OH) for the formation of a series of photocourier molecules containing model compounds (benzoic acids), as well as prodrugs, including salicylic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorambucil via a &#8220;benzyl&#8221; linker. Spectral characteristics (1H, 13C NMR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra) corresponded to the proposed structures. The photocourier molecules demonstrated absorption with high values of coefficient of molar extinction, exhibited contrasting green emission, and showed good dark stability. The mechanism of the photorelease was investigated through spectral analysis, HPLC&#8208;HRMS, and supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The photoheterolysis and elimination of carboxylic acids were proved to occur in the excited state, yielding a carbocation as an intermediate moiety. The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of Vero cells using the MTT&#8208;test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV&#8208;light.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted One Pot Cascade Conversion of Furfural to &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over Sc(OTf)3</title>

Microwave&#8208;assisted one pot cascade transformation of furfural to &#947;&#8208;valerolactone catalyzed by Sc(OTf)3.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) is considered as a star biochemical which can be used as a green solvent, fuel additive and versatile organic intermediate. In this study, metal triflate (M(OTf)n) was utilized as the catalyst for one&#8208;pot transformation of furfural (FF) to GVL in alcohol media under microwave irradiation. Alcohol plays multiple functions including solvent, hydrogen donor and alcoholysis reagent in this cascade reaction process. And process efficiency of GVL production from FF upgrading is strongly related to the effective charge density of selected catalyst and the reduction potential of selected alcohol. Complex (OTf)n&#8208;M&#8722;O(H)R, presenting both Br&#248;nsted acid and Lewis acid, is the real catalytic active species in this cascade reaction process. Among various catalysts, Sc(OTf)3 exhibited the best catalytic activity for GVL production. Various reaction parameters including the Sc(OTf)3 amount, reaction temperature and time were optimized by the response surface methodology with the central composite design (RSM&#8208;CCD). Up to 81.2&#8201;% GVL yield and 100&#8201;% FF conversion were achieved at 143.9&#8201;&#176;C after 8.1&#8197;h in the presence of 0.16&#8197;mmol catalyst. This catalyst exhibits high reusability and can be regenerated by oxidative degradation of humins. In addition, a plausible cascade reaction network was proposed based on the distribution of product.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Investigation of Intercellular Heterogeneity via Multiple Photocaged Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercellular heterogeneity can be demonstrated and characterized by total proteomic and cysteinomic analysis using multiple photocaged probes, including a locator, a ROS event trigger and a Cys&#8208;labeling probe, under regional irradiation schemes.







Abstract
Intercellular heterogeneity occurs widely under both normal physiological environments and abnormal disease&#8208;causing conditions. Several attempts to couple spatiotemporal information to cell states in a microenvironment were performed to decipher the cause and effect of heterogeneity. Furthermore, spatiotemporal manipulation can be achieved with the use of photocaged/photoactivatable molecules. Here, we provide a platform to spatiotemporally analyze differential protein expression in neighboring cells by multiple photocaged probes coupled with homemade photomasks. We successfully established intercellular heterogeneity (photoactivable ROS trigger) and mapped the targets (directly ROS&#8208;affected cells) and bystanders (surrounding cells), which were further characterized by total proteomic and cysteinomic analysis. Different protein profiles were shown between bystanders and target cells in both total proteome and cysteinome. Our strategy should expand the toolkit of spatiotemporal mapping for elucidating intercellular heterogeneity.

Despite large difference of ionic radii of Cu(II) and Ag(II) cations, difluorides of these metals readily form two structurally related solid solutions, which recite the structural polytypes of parent compounds.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction between orthorhombic AgF2 and monoclinic CuF2 (y=0.15, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) in a fluorine atmosphere resulted in coexisting solid solutions of Cu&#8208;poor orthorhombic and Cu&#8208;rich monoclinic phases with stoichiometry Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2. Based on X&#8208;ray powder diffraction analyses, the mutual solubility in the orthorhombic phase (AgF2&#8201;:&#8201;Cu) appears to be at an upper limit of Cu concentration of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% (Ag0.7Cu0.3F2), while the monoclinic phase (CuF2&#8201;:&#8201;Ag) can form a nearly stoichiometric Cu&#8201;:&#8201;Ag=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 solid solution (Cu0.56Ag0.44F2), preserving the CuF2 crystal structure. Experimental data and DFT calculations showed that AgF2&#8201;:&#8201;Cu and CuF2&#8201;:&#8201;Ag solid solutions deviate from the classical Vegard's law. Magnetic measurements of Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2 showed that the N&#233;el temperature (TN) decreases with increasing Cu content in both phases. Likewise, theoretical DFT+U calculations for Ag1&#8722;xCuxF2 showed that the progressive substitution of Ag by Cu decreases the magnetic interaction strength |J2D| in both structures. Electrical conductivity measurements of Ag0.85Cu0.15F2 showed a modest increase in specific ionic conductivity (3.71&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;13&#177;2.6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;15&#8197;S/cm) as compared to pure AgF2 (1.85&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;13&#177;1.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;15&#8197;S/cm), indicating the formation of a vacancy&#8208; or F adatom&#8208;free metal difluoride sample.

         <title>The Role of Crystalline Intermediates in Mechanochemical Cyclorhodation Reactions Elucidated by in&#8208;Situ X&#8208;ray Powder Diffraction and Computation</title>

In&#8208;situ monitoring by synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and computational methods enabled the formation of crystalline intermediates in mechanochemical cyclorhodation reactions to be studied.







Abstract
The occurrence of crystalline intermediates in mechanochemical reactions might be more widespread than previously assumed. For example, a recent study involving the acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation of N&#8722;Heterocycles with [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling revealed the formation of transient cocrystals between the reagents prior to the C&#8722;H activation step. However, such crystalline intermediates were only observed through stepwise intervallic ex&#8208;situ analysis, and their exact role in the C&#8722;H activation process remained unclear. In this study, we monitored the formation of discrete, stoichiometric cocrystals between benzo[h]quinoline and [Cp*RhCl2]2 by ball milling using in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This continuous analysis revealed an initial cocrystal that transformed into a second crystalline form. Computational studies showed that differences in noncovalent interactions made the [Cp*RhCl2]2 unit in the later&#8208;appearing cocrystal more reactive towards NaOAc. This demonstrated the advantage of cocrystal formation before the acetate&#8208;assisted metalation&#8211;deprotonation step, and how the net cooperative action of weak interactions between the reagents in mechanochemical experiments can lead to stable supramolecular assemblies, which can enhance substrate activation under ball&#8208;milling conditions. This could explain the superiority of some mechanochemical reactions, such as acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation, compared to their solution&#8208;based counterparts.

Modulation of the structural and electronic properties by the axial capping ligand (X) in tetrametallic iridium chains featuring fractional averaged oxidation states of +1.5 and electronic delocalization along the metallic chain is reported. An appreciable red shift as the electronegativity (Allred&#8208;Rochow scale) decreases was observed in the UV&#8208;Vis spectra (see Figure).







Abstract
Neutral [X&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;X] (X=Cl, Br, SCN, I) and dicationic [L&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;{Ir2}&#8722;L]2+ (L=MeCN, Me2CO) tetrametallic iridium chains made by connecting two dinuclear {Ir2} units ({Ir2}=[Ir2(&#956;&#8208;OPy)2(CO)4], OPy=2&#8208;pyridonate) by an iridium&#8211;iridium bond are described. The complexes exhibit fractional averaged oxidation states of +1.5 and electronic delocalization along the metallic chain. While the axial ligands do not significantly affect the metal&#8211;metal bond lengths, the metallic chain has a significant impact on the iridium&#8211;L/X bond distances. The complexes show free rotation around the unsupported iridium&#8208;iridium bond in solution, with a low&#8208;energy transition state for the chloride chain. The absorption spectra of these complexes show characteristic bands at 438&#8211;504&#8197;nm, which can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the terminal capping ligands.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Crystal&#8208;Assisted Etching of Nickel Foam for the Collectively Exhaustive Electrochemical Performance of Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust self&#8208;standing electrode is developed based on NF etched by organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal for the collectively exhaustive electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The rate&#8208;limiting step and reaction kinetics of OER on the surface of the etched NF were investigated based on the anodic transfer coefficient (&#945;a) values obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis.







Abstract
In this work, an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystal, violet&#8208;crystal (VC), was used to etch the nickel foam (NF) to fabricate a self&#8208;standing electrode for the water oxidation reaction. The efficacy of VC&#8208;assisted etching manifests the promising electrochemical performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring only ~356 and ~376&#8197;mV overpotentials to reach 50 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The OER activity improvement is attributed to the collectively exhaustive effects arising from the incorporation of various elements in the NF, and the enhancement of active site density. Furthermore, the self&#8208;standing electrode is robust, exhibiting a stable OER activity after 4,000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, and ~50&#8197;h. The anodic transfer coefficients (&#945;a) show that the first electron transfer step is the rate&#8208;determining step on the surface of NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 (NF etched by 1&#8197;g of VCs) electrode, while the chemical step involving dissociation following the first electron transfer step is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step in other electrodes. The lowest Tafel slope value observed in the NF&#8208;VCs&#8208;1.0 electrode indicates the high surface coverage of oxygen intermediates and more favorable OER reaction kinetics, as confirmed by high interfacial chemical capacitance and low charge transport/interfacial resistance. This work demonstrates the importance of VCs&#8208;assisted etching of NF to activate the OER, and the ability to predict reaction kinetics and rate&#8208;limiting step based on &#945;a values, which will open new avenues to identify advanced electrocatalysts for the water oxidation reaction.

         <title>Strong Be&#8722;N Interaction Induced Complementary Chemical Tuning to Design a Dual&#8208;gated Single Molecule Junction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing quantum mechanical calculations and theoretical modeling, we have demonstrated the design of a dual&#8208;gated single molecule junction where the strong Be&#8722;N beryllium bond acts as a primary gate to regulate the electronic current through the SMJ and the substituents at the para position of the substituted pyridine cater additional control for further manipulation of the gated current.







Abstract
The interaction between pyridines and the &#960;&#8208;hole of BeH2 leads to the formation of strong beryllium&#8208;bonded complexes. Theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Be&#8722;N bonding interaction can effectively regulate the electronic current through a molecular junction. The electronic conductance exhibits distinct switching behavior depending on the substituent groups at the para position of pyridine, highlighting the role of Be&#8722;N interaction as a potent chemical gate in the proposed device. The complexes exhibit short intermolecular distances ranging from 1.724 to 1.752&#8197;&#197;, emphasizing their strong binding. Detailed analysis of electronic rearrangements and geometric perturbations upon complex formation provides insights into the underlying reasons for the formation of such strong Be&#8722;N bonds, with bond strengths varying from &#8722;116.25 to &#8722;92.96&#8197;kJ/mol. Moreover, the influence of chemical substituents on the local electronic transmission of the beryllium&#8208;bonded complex offers valuable insights for the implementation of a secondary chemical gate in single&#8208;molecule devices. This study paves the way for the development of chemically gateable, functional single&#8208;molecule transistors, advancing the design and fabrication of multifunctional single&#8208;molecule devices in the nanoscale regime.

         <title>A Versatile Urea Type Linker for Functionalizing Natural Glycans and Its Validation in Glycan Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel linker for the functionalization of glycosylamines prepared from isolated N&#8208;glycans is described. The protected linked N&#8208;glycans could be easily purified and after deprotection, the primary amine generated serves as &#8220;anchor&#8221; in the preparation of glycan microarrays. The performance of the newly described linker is compared with 3 other linkers after incubation with lectins with known specificity.







Abstract
The isolation from organisms and readily available glycoproteins has become an increasingly convenient source of N&#8208;glycans for multiple applications including glycan microarrays, as reference standards in glycan analysis or as reagents that improve bioavailability of protein and peptide therapeutics through conjugation. A problematic step in the isolation process on a preparative scale can be the attachment of a linker for the improved purification, separation, immobilization and quantification of the glycan structures. Addressing this issue, we firstly aimed for the development of an UV active linker for a fast and reliable attachment to anomeric glycosylamines via urea bond formation. Secondly, we validated the new linker on glycan arrays in a comparative study with a collection of N&#8208;glycans which were screened against various lectins. In total, we coupled four structurally varied N&#8208;glycans to four different linkers, immobilized all constructs on a microarray and compared their binding affinities to four plant and fungal lectins of widely described specificity. Our study shows that the urea type linker showed an overall superior performance for lectin binding and once more, highlights the often neglected influence of the choice of linker on lectin recognition.

         <title>Alkylcyanoborate Anions: Building Blocks for Fluorine&#8208;Free Low&#8208;Viscosity, Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylcyanoborate anions were found to be building blocks for fluorine&#8208;free ionic liquids with appealing properties with respect to potential applications in materials science especially for electrolyte chemistry. The influence of different types and number of alkyl chains on the IL properties has been elucidated.







Abstract
A set of mixed&#8208;substituted potassium alkylcyano&#8208; and alkylcyanofluoroborates has been synthesized using easily accessible starting compounds and characterized by elemental analysis, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. In addition, single&#8208;crystal structures of salts of the cyanoborate anions have been derived from X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids ([EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs) with the new borate anions have been synthesized and their physicochemical properties, that is, high thermal and electrochemical stability, low viscosity, and high conductivity, have been compared to the properties of related [EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs. The influence of the different alkyl substituents at boron has been assessed. The exemplary study on the properties with the [EMIm]+&#8208;ILs with the mixed water stable alkylcyanoborate anions points towards the potential of these fluorine&#8208;free borate anions, in general.

         <title>Constructing Hierarchical Porous MoO2@Mo2N@C Composite via a Confined Pyrolysis Synthetic Strategy Towards Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molybdenum&#8208;based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy was proposed to construct hierarchical porous MoO2@Mo2N@C composite. Owing to the unique structure and abundant active sites, MoO2@Mo2N@C composite exhibit excellent lithium storage properties as anode materials.







Abstract
Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) demonstrates a big potential toward lithium&#8208;ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. The sluggish reaction kinetics and large volume change during cycling process, however, unavoidably lead to inferior electrochemical performance, thus failing to satisfy the requirements of practical applications. Herein, we developed a molybdenum&#8208;based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy to achieve a novel hierarchical porous MoO2@Mo2N@C composite. A two&#8208;step successive annealing process was proposed to obtain a hybrid phase of MoO2 and Mo2N, which was used to further improve the electrochemical performance of MoO2&#8208;based anode. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;dispersed MoO2 nanoparticles can ensure ample active sites exposure to the electrolyte, while conductive Mo2N quantum dots afford pseudo&#8208;capacitive response, which conduces to the migration of ions and electrons. Additionally, the interior voids could provide buffer spaces to surmount the effect of volume change, thereby avoiding the fracture of MoO2 nanoparticles. Benefiting from the aforesaid synergies, the as&#8208;obtained MoO2@Mo2N@C electrode demonstrates a striking initial discharge capacity (1760.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and decent long&#8208;term cycling stability (652.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

     alt="Constructing Hierarchical Porous MoO2@Mo2N@C Composite via a Confined Pyrolysis Synthetic Strategy Towards Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel molybdenum-based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy was proposed to construct hierarchical porous MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N@C composite. Owing to the unique structure and abundant active sites, MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N@C composite exhibit excellent lithium storage properties as anode materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molybdenum dioxide (MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) demonstrates a big potential toward lithium-ion storage due to its high theoretical capacity. The sluggish reaction kinetics and large volume change during cycling process, however, unavoidably lead to inferior electrochemical performance, thus failing to satisfy the requirements of practical applications. Herein, we developed a molybdenum-based oxyacid salt confined pyrolysis strategy to achieve a novel hierarchical porous MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N@C composite. A two-step successive annealing process was proposed to obtain a hybrid phase of MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N, which was used to further improve the electrochemical performance of MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based anode. We demonstrate that the well-dispersed MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles can ensure ample active sites exposure to the electrolyte, while conductive Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N quantum dots afford pseudo-capacitive response, which conduces to the migration of ions and electrons. Additionally, the interior voids could provide buffer spaces to surmount the effect of volume change, thereby avoiding the fracture of MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. Benefiting from the aforesaid synergies, the as-obtained MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N@C electrode demonstrates a striking initial discharge capacity (1760.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and decent long-term cycling stability (652.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work provides a new way for the construction of advanced anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A flexible textile&#8208;based self&#8208;charging energy system was proposed and assembled by ZIHC and TENG, enabling the rapid harvesting and simultaneous storage of human movement energy for portable electronics. The fabricated NVO@CC//CC ZIHCs offer reliable scalability, tunable adaptability and excellent long&#8208;term and mechanical stability, demonstrates a wide voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V and a high area capacitance value of 267.1&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2. TENG is made by spin&#8208;coating PDMS on NVO@CC and achieves a maximum instantaneous power of 18.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits excellent flexibility and stability. The self&#8208;powered system can charge timers and electronic watches steadily for a long time by hand&#8208;tapping, proving self&#8208;charging power systems have great potential for applications in portable electronic devices.







Abstract
The development of portable electronic devices has created greater demands for multifunctional energy integration systems. Self&#8208;powered systems have gained widespread interest because they can collect and storage renewable environmental energy and provide stable electricity to electronic devices. Herein, we developed a flexible self&#8208;charging energy system, involving textile&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion hybrid (ZIHC) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which demonstrates wearable, compatibility, lightweight and can quickly harvest and store energy. NixV2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O (NVO) loaded on carbon cloth (CC) with Ni2+/H2O ions intercalated as the cathode was assembled with activated CC to form a ZIHC, which has a voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V and capacitance value of 267.1&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as good charge and discharge rates and excellent cycling stability. At the same time, the NVO/CC can be assembled with PDMS to form a TENG achieving a maximum instantaneous power of 18.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The device can be flexibly worn over the body to continuously harvest and store biomechanical energy and charge the electronic wristwatch successfully. This work demonstrates great convenience and promising practical applications as sustainable flexible energy system for portable electronic devices.

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
New superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials are reported. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The sodium ionic conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention, and chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in such batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Dyes Bearing Phosphine and Phosphorylamide Moieties: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 1,8&#8208;naphthalimides bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties has been prepared and their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions have been investigated. The complexation with Pd(II) quenches the fluorescence emission of the dye but activates an unexpected reactivity leading to a novel strongly emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety.







Abstract
1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides (NIs) represent a class of organic dyes with interesting optical properties that has been extensively explored in the last decades in lighting devices, chemosensors, optical probes or medicinal chemistry. However, despite their remarkable potential, reports on organometallic dyes bearing NIs are scarce and virtually inexistent regarding palladium(II) complexes. Herein, we report the synthesis of NIs bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties and the characterization of their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions. It is shown that the introduction of phosphine moieties in the naphthalimide core results in a marked increase in non&#8208;radiative processes, leading to a significant reduction of the emission efficiency and lifetime of these dyes, compared to amine&#8208;bearing counterparts. The complexation to Pd(II) sequesters the electronic contribution of chelating moieties, with complexes assuming an optical behavior similar to that of unsubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The complexation significantly increases the acidity of chelating secondary amines, giving rise to an unexpected intramolecular reaction that results in the formation of a novel 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety. The new dye exhibits good emission quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and sensitivity to basic media, evidencing potential for application in optical imaging and sensing scenarios.

2&#8208;(Pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced as a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold. The scaffold was first converted into an Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of Au(I)Cl at the carbene site. By using the Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes with intermetallic interactions were readily preparable with 3d&#8208;transition metals (CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII). The structures of these complexes were unambiguously determined by SC&#8208;XRD analysis.







Abstract
As a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold, 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced. The scaffold was first converted into a meridional Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of a Au(I)Cl moiety at the carbene center. The Au(I) center and the N,N&#8208;chelating moiety were expected to function as metallophilic and 4e&#8208;&#963;&#8208;donative interaction sites, respectively, in the binding of the second metal center. In this manner, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized with different 3d&#8208;metal sources, such as cationic CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII salts. SC&#8208;XRD analysis showed that the mono&#8208;3d&#8208;metal di&#8208;gold(I) trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were constructed through gold(I)&#8208;metal interactions. Metallophilic interactions were also investigated by quantum chemical calculations including the AIM and IGMH methods.

In this study, we present the use of cooperative cation&#8208;binding catalysis as an efficient method for synthesizing chiral allylic amines. By utilizing a chiral oligoEG and potassium fluoride as a cation&#8208;binding catalyst and base, respectively, a wide range of biologically relevant chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amines are obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) through the organocatalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Henry&#8208;like reaction of &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted nitroalkenes with &#945;&#8208;amidosulfones as imine precursors. Preliminary use of a chiral 2&#8208;nitroallylic amine as a Michael acceptor demonstrated its potential application for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Neutral and Cationic Molybdenum Imido Alkylidene Cyclic Alkyl Amino Carbene (CAAC) Complexes for Olefin Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
The first neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes are reported.

Abstract
The first neutral and cationic Mo imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes of the general formulae [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)2(CAAC)] and [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)(CAAC)][B(ArF)4] (X=Br, Cl, OTf, OC6F5; CAAC=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyltetrahydropyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) have been synthesized from molybdenum imido bishalide alkylidene DME precursors. Different combinations of the imido and &#8220;X&#8221; ligands have been employed to understand synthetic peculiarities. Selected complexes have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the pronounced &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;acceptor characteristics of CAACs, the corresponding neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene CAAC complexes do not require the presence of stabilizing donor ligands such as nitriles. Calculations on the PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP level for PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;SVP optimized geometries revealed partial charges at molybdenum similar to the corresponding molybdenum imido alkylidene N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with a slightly higher polarization of the molybdenum alkylidene bond in the CAAC complexes. All cationic complexes have been tested in olefin metathesis reactions and showed improved activity compared to the analogous NHC complexes for hydrocarbon&#8208;based substrates, allowing for turnover numbers (TONs) up to 9500 even at room temperature. Some Mo imido alkylidene CAAC complexes are tolerant towards functional groups like thioethers and sulfonamides.

Abstract
A set of ruthenium(II)&#8208;protic&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, [Ru(NNCH)(PPh3)2(X)]Cl (1, X=Cl and 2, X=H) and their deprotonated forms [Ru(NNC)(PPh3)2(X)] (1&#8217;, X=Cl and 2&#8217;, X=H), in which NNC is a new unsymmetrical pincer ligand, are reported. The four complexes are interconvertible by simple acid&#8208;base chemistry. The combined theoretical and spectroscopic investigations indicate charge segregation in anionic&#8208;NHC complexes (1&#8217; and 2&#8217;) and can be described from a Lewis pair perspective. The chemical reactivity of deprotonated complex 1&#8217; shows cooperative small molecule activation. Complex 1&#8217; activates H&#8722;H bond of hydrogen, C(sp3)&#8208;I bond of iodomethane, and C(sp)&#8208;H bond of phenylacetylene. The activation of CO2 using anionic NHC complex 1&#8217; at moderate temperature and ambient pressure and subsequent conversion to formate is also described. All the new compounds have been characterized using ESI&#8208;MS, 1H, 13C, and 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Molecular structures of 1, 2, and 2&#8217; have also been determined with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The cooperative small molecule activation perspective broadens the scope of potential applications of anionic&#8208;NHC complexes in small molecule activation, including the conversion of carbon dioxide to formate, a much sought after reaction in the renewable energy and sustainable development domains.

The activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using anionic NHC complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8217; at moderate temperature and ambient pressure and subsequent conversion to formate is also described. All the new compounds have been characterized using ESI-MS, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Molecular structures of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8217; have also been determined with single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The cooperative small molecule activation perspective broadens the scope of potential applications of anionic-NHC complexes in small molecule activation, including the conversion of carbon dioxide to formate, a much sought after reaction in the renewable energy and sustainable development domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space, Lone&#8208;Pair Promoted Aromatic Substitution: A Relay Mechanism Can Beat Out Direct Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through stabilized &#8220;relay&#8221; tranisition states: Various Lewis basic functional groups can spatially activate aromatic substitutions. Mechanistically, these reactions proceed through an exothermic relay pathway, as opposed to the previously assumed endothermic direct activation. In this article, both experimental and theoretical models are employed to investigate this newly discovered mode of arene activation in detail.







Abstract
We report a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of through&#8208;space arene activation with halogens, tetrazoles and achiral esters and amides. Contrary to previously assumed direct activation through &#963;&#8208;complex stabilization, our results suggest that these reactions proceed by a relay mechanism wherein the lone pair&#8208;containing activators form exothermic &#960;&#8208;complexes with electrophilic nitronium ion before transferring it to the probe ring through low barrier transition states. Noncovalent interactions (NCI) plots and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analyses depict favorable interactions between the Lewis base (LB) and the nitronium ion in the precomplexes and the transition states, suggesting directing group participation throughout the mechanism. The regioselectivity of substitution also comports with a relay mechanism. In all, these data pave the way for an alternate platform of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.

         <title>Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Scope and Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of metal cyaphido compounds in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions with azides to afford metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes is described. The reactions proceed straightforwardly, under mild conditions and in good yields, in a manner reminiscent of the classic alkyne&#8208;azide click reaction. The resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.







Abstract
Several examples of the cyaphide&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction to afford metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes are reported. The gold(I) triazaphospholes Au(IDipp)(CPN3R) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R=tBu, Ad, Dipp), magnesium(II) triazaphospholes, {Mg(DippNacNac)(CPN3R)}2 (DippNacNac=CH{C(CH3)N(Dipp)}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl; R=tBu, Bn), and germanium(II) triazaphosphole Ge(DippNacNac)&#8208;(CPN3tBu) can be prepared straightforwardly, under mild conditions and in good yields, in a manner reminiscent of the classic alkyne&#8208;azide click reaction (albeit without a catalyst). This reactivity can be extended to compounds with two azide functional groups such as 1,3&#8208;diazidobenzene. It is shown that the resulting metallo&#8208;triazaphospholes can be used as precursors to carbon&#8208;functionalized species, including protio&#8208; and iodo&#8208;triazaphospholes.

Multiply exo&#8208;methylated corannulenes have been synthesized by in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation sequences that involve the reduction of corannulenes using sodium to form the anionic corannulene species and the subsequent SN2 reaction of the anionic species with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. Corannulenes with/without methyl groups, dimethyl sulfate, and sodium are shown as flowers, butterflies, and the soil, respectively.

         <title>Cover Feature: Unexpected Coexisting Solid Solutions in the Quasi&#8208;Binary Ag(II)F2/Cu(II)F2 Phase Diagram (Chem. Eur. J. 52/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of F2 overpressure, at elevated temperature, and despite the similarity of their crystal structures, CuF2 and AgF2 unexpectedly form two distinct solid solutions, (Cu1&#8722;xAgx)F2 and (Ag1&#8722;xCux)F2. Each phase shows different mutual solubility of Cu2+ and Ag2+ (shown as yellow and violet balls), and their magnetic properties are strongly impacted by this seemingly simple isoelectronic substitution.

The cover shows super sodium ionic conductivity in polyanion&#8208;added sodium zirconium chloride&#8208;based compound. A new highway was discovered for sodium ions to migrate towards cathode. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;Inoishi and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Organoselenium Compounds: Chemistry and Applications in Organic Synthesis</title>

Selenium, a crucial trace element for life, naturally occurs as selenocysteine. Its growing interest over the years is focused not only on the relevant pharmacological properties but also on its use in catalysis. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen. Different aspects on its appealing chemistry are comprised in this Review article.







Abstract
Selenium, originally described as a toxin, turns out to be a crucial trace element for life that appears as selenocysteine and its dimer, selenocystine. From the point of view of drug developments, selenium&#8208;containing drugs are isosteres of sulfur and oxygen with the advantage that the presence of the selenium atom confers antioxidant properties and high lipophilicity, which would increase cell membrane permeation leading to better oral bioavailability. In this article, we have focused on the relevant features of the selenium atom, above all, the corresponding synthetic approaches to access a variety of organoselenium molecules along with the proposed reaction mechanisms. The preparation and biological properties of selenosugars, including selenoglycosides, selenonucleosides, selenopeptides, and other selenium&#8208;containing compounds will be treated. We have attempted to condense the most important aspects and interesting examples of the chemistry of selenium into a single article.

         <title>Multiply exo&#8208;Methylated Corannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 52, September 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The most significant result of this study is that multiply exo&#8208;methylated corannulenes have been synthesized by a reductive surface reaction using sodium dispersion as a reducing agent and dimethyl sulfate as a reduction&#8208;resistant electrophile.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202301557).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Shinobu Aoyagi (Nagoya City University), Takahiro Sasamori (University of Tsukuba), and Hideki Yorimitsu (Kyoto University). The image depicts multiply exo&#8208;methylated corannulenes (flowers) synthesized from corannulene (central large flower) by the reduction with sodium (soil) to form anionic corannulenes and the subsequent methylation with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate (butterflies).

         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, we wished to synthesize P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of the above mentioned N&#8208;heterocycles. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y = alkoxy, aryl) (30%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, our method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect was significant as compared to that of the reference compounds.</dc:description>

Novel strategies and reagents that can address the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity issues inherent to these biomolecules, while delivering stable and functionalizable conjugates, are therefore needed. Herein, we introduce the crosslinking ethynylbenziodazolone (EBZ) reagent JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 for the conjugation of peptides and proteins through the selective linkage of cysteine residues. This easily accessed compound gives access to peptide conjugates or stapled peptides under mild and tuneable conditions. Applied to the antibody fragment of antigen binding (Fab) species, JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 delivered rebridged proteins in a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;reaction process with high regioselectivity, outperforming the standard reagents commonly used for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptionally stable and super&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts derived from semiconducting metal phosphonate frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two new isotypic semiconductive metal phosphonate frameworks Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8211;&#160;is 1,4&#8209;naphthalenediphosphonate). Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] have optical bandgaps of 1.7 eV and 2.5 eV respectively, which are within the semiconductive regime. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst generated a lower overpotential of 374 mV in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&#8211;1&#160;at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2&#160;in alkaline electrolyte (1 mol L&#8211;1&#160;KOH), which is indicative of remarkably superior reaction kinetics. Benchmarking of the oxygen evolution reaction, OER of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] materials as precatalyst coupled with nickel foam (NF) showed exceptional long&#8208;term stability at a current density of 50 mA cm&#8211;2for water splitting compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C/RuO2@NF after 30 h in 1 mol L&#8208;1&#160;KOH. In order to further understand the OER mechanism, the transformation of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] into its electrocatalytically active species was investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deinterpenetration of IRMOF&#8208;9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the iconic characteristics of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is the possesssion of guest&#8208;accessible pores. Increasing pore size has a direct and often beneficial impact on a MOF&#8217;s adsorption and separation properties. However, as pore size increases, the resulting void spaces are often filled by interpenetrated frameworks, where one or more networks crystallize within the pore system of another identical network, reducing the MOF&#8217;s free volume and pore size. Furthermore, due to the thermodynamic favorability of interpenetration during solvothermal synthesis, techniques to synthetically differentiate interpenetrated from non&#8208;interpenetrated MOFs are paramount. Herein we report the synthesis of deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9 via halide mediated deinterpenetrative conversion of Zn4O&#8208;derived IRMOF&#8208;9. IRMOF&#8208;9, when treated with ethylammonium bromide, is quasi&#8208;selectively etched, revealing the non&#8208;interpenetrated analogue, IRMOF&#8208;10 (deinterpenetrated IRMOF&#8208;9), which can be isolated prior to complete dissolution by the bromide solution. Dye adsorption, surface area and pore size distribution analysis, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and elemental analysis are consistent with successful deinterpenetration.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism  and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomative [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of 1&#8208;Naphthols with In&#8208;situ Generated ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a catalytic, enantioselective dearomative reaction of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols, which poses a synthetic challenge to organic chemists because of the relative ease of rearomatization via the elimination of a proton. In this work, the direct dearomatization of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with in&#8208;situ generated ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). The reported convergent method allows the use of readily available simple 1&#8208;naphthols without pre&#8208;functionalization, furnishing a variety of naphthopyran derivatives in good yields (up to 96%) and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) under mild reaction conditions. The observed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities are the keys to the success of the current strategy utilizing o&#8208;QM as a diene surrogates, in combination with CPA catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enrichment strategies for efficient CO2 electroreduction in acidic electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been recognized as an appealing route to remarkably accelerate the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle and reduce carbon emissions. Notwithstanding great catalytic activity that has been acquired in neutral and alkaline conditions, the carbonates generated from the inevitable reaction of the input CO2 with the hydroxide severely lower carbon utilization and energy efficiency. By contrast, CO2RR in an acidic condition can effectively circumvent the carbonate issues; however, the activity and selectivity of CO2RR in acidic electrolytes will be decreased significantly due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;&#160;Enriching the CO2 and the key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and enhance the product selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2RR. In this review, the catalytic mechanism and key technique challenges of CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of enrichment strategies for promoting the CO2RR in the acidic electrolyte is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategies in acidic CO2RR are expounded.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition Process in Resorcinarene&#8208;based Coordination Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in Cu and Ag capsules by CD and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and&#160;1H NMR measurements reveal that the host&#8208;guest complexation proceeds under second&#8208;order reactions and that these capsules undergo partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. Slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries&#160;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridiyl arms.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in Cu and Ag capsules by CD and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;-diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and&#160;1H NMR measurements reveal that the host-guest complexation proceeds under second-order reactions and that these capsules undergo partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. Slippage also contributes to host-guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries&#160;p-methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;-bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron-rich&#160;p-methoxyphenyl group and the electron-poor 2,2&#8217;-bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without partial dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence and Morphology of Aggregates Built from a Mechanically Bonded Amphiphilic Bistable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanically bonded amphiphile (MBA)&#8208;bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and prepared. In both the solution and aggregated states, H2 demonstrated pH&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity.







Abstract
Advanced Organic Chemical Materials Co&#8208;constructed Mechanically bonded amphiphiles (MBAs), also known as mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have emerged as an important kind of functional building block for the construction of artificial molecular machines and soft materials. Herein, a novel MBA, i.&#8201;e., bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and synthesized. In the solution state, H2 demonstrated pH and metal ion&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, respectively. Importantly, the amphiphilic feature of H2 has endowed it with unique self&#8208;assembly capability, and nanospheres were obtained in a mixed H2O/CH3CN solvent. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity. Interestingly, larger spheres with novel pearl&#8208;chain&#8208;like structures from H2 were observed after adding stoichiometric Zn2+. In particular, H2 shows pH&#8208;responsive emissions in its aggregation state, allowing the visualization of the shuttling movement by just naked eyes. It is assumed that the well&#8208;designed [2]rotaxane, and particularly the proposed concept of MBA shown here, will further enrich the families of MIMs, offering prospects for synthesizing more MIMs with novel assembly capabilities and bottom&#8208;up building dynamic smart materials with unprecedented functions.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Modulated Magnetization Dynamics of Mononuclear Trigonal Prismatic CoII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying alkyl chains with different lengths at the end of the CoII&#8208;SMM with a rigid D3h coordination geometry influence its magnetization dynamics. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination symmetry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics.







Abstract
Four benzeneboron&#8208;capped mononuclear CoII complexes with different alkyl substitutions on the fourth position of phenylboronic acid were obtained. The CoII ions are all wrapped by the pocket&#8208;like ligands and located in trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that they show different magnetization dynamics, such as distinct relaxation rates at the same temperature, the faster QTM rates for the ethyl and propyl substituted complexes, as well as different relaxation processes. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination geometry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics. This work demonstrates that the alkyl chains even locating far away from the metal center can have a large impact on the magnetic behavior of the CoII complex with a very rigid coordination geometry, offering a new perspective towards transition metal based single&#8208;molecule magnets.

         <title>Controlling the Morphological Features, Aspect Ratio and Emission Patterns of Supramolecular Copolymers by Restricted Dimensional Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous 1D polymerization of a PE derivative and the 2D polymerization of a BODIPY derivative is controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio. The resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibit morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features.







Abstract
One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional &#960;&#8208;systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self&#8208;sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Herein, it is established that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (PE) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (BODIPY) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of BODIPY is 50&#8201;% in the BODIPY&#8208;PE mixture, the 1D polymerization of PE is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle&#8208;like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8211;6. The addition of 75&#8201;% of BODIPY to PE resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8211;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of PE monomers. Moreover, the resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibited morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features as observed by the time&#8208;resolved emission studies.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Properties of a Series of Trinuclear Fe2Ru and Corresponding Pentanuclear Fe2Ru2Ag Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the number of methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene of the terminal iron increases, the neighbouring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT energy increases in both the trinuclear N4+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) and the pentanuclear M5+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;NC&#8208;AgI&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) complexes, but the redox potential of the ruthenium in the pentanuclear system shows an opposite trend of change with respect to the corresponding trinuclear complexes.







Abstract
A series of trimetallic cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeII(dppe)CpMen] &#8208; [PF6]2 (N[PF6]2, n=0, N =1; n=1, N=2; n=3, N=3; Cp=cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, MeOpy=4&#8208;methoxypyridine) and their one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidized compounds N3+ and N4+ were synthesized and characterized. Meanwhile, a series of corresponding linear cyanido&#8208;bridged pentanuclear compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeIII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;AgI&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeIII(dppe)CpMen][BF4]5 (M[BF4]5, n=0, M=4; n=1, M=5; n=3, M=6) were also obtained and well characterized. The investigations suggest that in the trinuclear system there exists remote interaction between the two Fe centers, but no significant interactions exist across the central silver unit between the metals on the two sides of the silver center in the pentanuclear system. In both the trinuclear N4+ and the pentanuclear M5+ complexes, there exists the neighboring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT transitions, and the MM'CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal&#8208;metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear N4+ series increases, but that in the pentanuclear M5+ complexes decreases.

&lt;p&gt;A series of trimetallic cyanidometal-bridged compounds [Me&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;Cp(dppe)Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-(&#956;-NC)-Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(MeOpy)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-(&#956;-CN)-Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(dppe)CpMe&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;] - [PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;N[PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, n=0, N =1; n=1, N=2; n=3, N=3; Cp=cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, MeOpy=4-methoxypyridine) and their one- and two-electron oxidized compounds &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized and characterized. Meanwhile, a series of corresponding linear cyanido-bridged pentanuclear compounds [Me&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;Cp(dppe)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-(&#956;-NC)-Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(MeOpy)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-(&#956;-NC)-Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-(&#956;-CN)-Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(MeOpy)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-(&#956;-CN)-Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(dppe)CpMe&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;M[BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, n=0, M=4; n=1, M=5; n=3, M=6) were also obtained and well characterized. The investigations suggest that in the trinuclear system there exists remote interaction between the two Fe centers, but no significant interactions exist across the central silver unit between the metals on the two sides of the silver center in the pentanuclear system. In both the trinuclear &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and the pentanuclear &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; complexes, there exists the neighboring Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; MM&#8242;CT transitions, and the MM'CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal-metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear &lt;b&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; series increases, but that in the pentanuclear &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; complexes decreases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Molecular Quantum Mechanical Modeling and Machine Learning for Accelerated Reaction Screening and Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining molecular quantum mechanical modeling and machine learning, reaction screening and discovery can be accelerated significantly. In this Concept, we walk through the main steps associated with a typical workflow for high&#8208;throughput reaction screening campaigns, and highlight best practices and potential pitfalls at every stage.







Abstract
Molecular quantum mechanical modeling, accelerated by machine learning, has opened the door to high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns of complex properties, such as the activation energies of chemical reactions and absorption/emission spectra of materials and molecules; in&#8197;silico. Here, we present an overview of the main principles, concepts, and design considerations involved in such hybrid computational quantum chemistry/machine learning screening workflows, with a special emphasis on some recent examples of their successful application. We end with a brief outlook of further advances that will benefit the field.

         <title>Highly Functionalized SWCNTs with a Dopamine Derivative as a Support for Pd Nanoparticles: A Recyclable Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitro Compounds and the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of dopamine azide on SWCNTs in o&#8208;DCB at 160&#8201;&#176;C gave a material with high degree of functionalization still maintaining &#960;&#8208;network of SWCNTs. The presence of the catechol units was exploited to immobilize palladium nanoparticles. The hybrid material was used as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were functionalized with a dopamine derivative in which the amine group was converted to azide (dopamine azide). The direct reaction of SWCNTs and dopamine azide in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene at high temperature (160&#8201;&#176;C) led to very highly functionalized CNTs (&#8776;60&#8197;wt.%). Surprisingly, despite this high degree of functionalization, Raman spectroscopy detected a low disruption of the &#960;&#8208;network of the carbonaceous support. This finding was justified by the rehybridization from sp3 to sp2 of the sidewall carbon atoms of CNTs involved in the functionalization process. Further characterization by means of different techniques such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed to shed some light on the chemical composition and morphology of the obtained material. Moreover, the estimation of the total content of phenolic units and their reducing potential after CNTs functionalization was also assessed using Folin and Ciocalteu and 2,2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picryl hydrazide (DPPH) assays. The functionalization of CNTs was exploited to immobilize palladium(II) species that were subsequently reduced with NaBH4 leading to the formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so obtained hybrid material was used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.

         <title>Nucleophile&#8208;Triggered &#960;&#8208;Topological Transformation: A New Synthetic Approach to Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Rhodamines</title>

         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method: A new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye, called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor), has been developed. Linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor is prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles (Nu&#8722;) with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability.







Abstract
We describe a &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method for the preparation of a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor). In contrast to conventional NIR&#8208;emissive dyes that require tedious synthetic steps and/or a high cost, linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor can be regioselectively prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability owing to the cooperative &#960;&#8208;electron system of rhodamines and polymethine scaffolds. Large bathochromic shifts of the absorption and fluorescence emission maxima can be achieved by modifying the N&#8208;substituted group to obtain NIR&#8208;absorbing/emitting PeR Fluor. We also demonstrate the stimulus&#8208;responsive functionality of PeR Fluor through the addition of chemicals (acid/base), which shows switchable NIR and visible fluorescence response. Our &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method is a promising approach to produce new functionalized rhodamine dyes.

         <title>Diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene Acetals: Red&#8208;Shifted Solid&#8208;State and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters from a One&#8208;Pot Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the nucleophilicity of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, 23 diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be accessed, although the aroylation leads to a significant bathochromic shift both in the solid and aggregated states as well as an increase in aggregate stability. Cyclized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be converted into pyrazole systems in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
Symmetric and unsymmetric diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be readily accessed in consecutive syntheses in good to excellent yields by exploiting the inherent nucleophilic character of the methine position. Different aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals as well as acid chlorides yield a library of 19 diaroyl compounds with substitution and linker pattern&#8208;tunable emission properties, leading to a significant red&#8208;shift of emission in the solid and aggregated state, which was thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the stability of the luminescent aggregates is highly increased. In a follow&#8208;up one&#8208;pot procedure, pyrazolo&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be accessed employing a nucleophilic cyclocondensation.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Polymerization of a Lewis Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;pentafulvene)titanium in the reaction with Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomers provide a convenient new route to polyphosphinoboranes. This method offers access to high molecular mass materials under very mild conditions and short reaction times. The findings represent an unprecedented example of a transition&#8208;metal mediated polymerization of Lewis base&#8208;stabilized alkylphosphinoborane.







Abstract
The reaction of the Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomer tBuHPBH2NMe3 (2&#8201;a) with catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5:&#951;1&#8208;adamantylidenepentafulvene)titanium (1) provides a convenient new route to the polyphosphinoborane [tBuPH&#8208;BH2]n (3&#8201;a). This method offers access to high molar mass materials under mild conditions and with short reaction times (20&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h in toluene). It represents an unprecedented example of a transition metal&#8208;mediated polymerization of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized Group 13/15 compound. Preliminary studies of the substrate scope and a potential mechanism are reported.

         <title>&#8220;Holographic&#8221; Autostereoscopic Displays: A Perspective on Their Technology and Potential Impact in Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding dimensions to chemistry: I explore the potential of &#8220;holographic&#8221; autostereoscopic displays in chemistry research and education. This perspective delves into how this emerging technology could enhance the understanding of complex molecular structures, offering a more immersive and intuitive learning and research experience.







Abstract
The three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules is essential for understanding their properties and behavior. Traditional 2D representations and digital 3D models presented on 2D media often fall short in conveying the complexity of molecular structures. Autostereoscopic displays, often marketed as &#8220;holographic&#8221; displays, pose a potential solution to this challenge. These displays, with their multi&#8208;view and single&#8208;view configurations, promise to advance chemistry education and research by offering accurate 3D representations with depth and parallax. In this perspective, I delve into the possibilities and limitations of autostereoscopic displays in chemistry, discussing the underlying technology and potential applications, from research to teaching and science communication. Multi&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays excel in facilitating collaborative work by enabling multiple viewers to simultaneously perceive the same 3D structure from different angles. However, they currently suffer from low resolution and high cost, which could limit their immediate widespread adoption. Conversely, single&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays with eye&#8208;tracking, while limited to one viewer at a time, provide higher resolution at a lower cost, thus suggesting that they might become the technology of the future given the balance of price to performance. Despite current limitations, autostereoscopic displays possess undeniable potential for shaping the future of chemistry education and research.

         <title>Beta Amyloid Oligomers with Higher Cytotoxicity have Higher Sidechain Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical states of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm beta amyloid oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the sidechain molecular motion of the residue K16 is more dynamic. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.







Abstract
The underlying biophysical principle governing the cytotoxicity of the oligomeric aggregates of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides has long been an enigma. Here we show that the size of A&#946;40 oligomers can be actively controlled by incubating the peptides in reverse micelles. Our approach allowed for the first time a detailed comparison of the structures and dynamics of two A&#946;40 oligomers of different sizes, viz., 10 and 23&#8197;nm, by solid&#8208;state NMR. From the chemical shift data, we infer that the conformation and/or the chemical environments of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the molecular motion of the sidechain of its charged residue K16 is more dynamic. Interestingly, the residue A21 exhibits unusually high structural rigidity. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOFs with Enriched Surface Bi Active Sites for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherent challenges in using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the combination of wide&#8208;range light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transfer as well as highly exposed catalytic active sites for CO2 activation and reduction. We present here a promising solution to satisfy these requirements together by modulating the crystal facet and surface atomic structure of a porphyrin&#8208;based bismuth&#8208;MOF (Bi&#8208;PMOF). The series of structural and photo&#8208;electronic characterizations together with photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment collectively establish that the enriched Bi active sites on the (010) surface prefer to promote efficient charge separation and transfer as well as the activation and reduction of CO2. Specifically, the Bi&#8208;PMOFs&#8208;120&#8208;F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimum photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to CO (28.61 umol&#183;h&#8208;1g&#8208;1) and CH4 (8.81 umol&#183;h&#8208;1g&#8208;1). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group p&#8208;block metal Bi&#8208;MOF photocatalysts for CO2 reduction through a facet&#8208;regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure&#8208;activity relationships of the MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomass Separators as a&#8220;Lifesaver&#8221;for Safe and Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth&#160;of lithium dendrites and the shuttle of polysulfides in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have hindered their development. In LMBs, the cathode and anode are separated by a separator, although this does not solve the battery's issues. The use of biomass materials is widespread for modifying the separator due to their porous structure and abundant functional groups. LMBs perform more electrochemically when lithium ions are deposited uniformly and polysulfide shuttling is reduced using biomass separators. In this&#160;review, we analyze the growth of lithium dendrite and the shuttle of polysulfide in LMBs, summarize the types of biomass separator materials and the mechanisms of action&#160;(providing mechanical barriers, promoting uniform deposition of metal ions, capturing polysulfides, shielding polysulfide).&#160;The prospect of developing new separator materials from the perspective of regulating ion transport and physical sieving efficiency as well as the application of advanced technologies such as synchrotron radiation to characterize the mechanism of action of biomass separators is also proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Small graphene oxide (s&#8208;GO) nanosheets reversibly downregulate central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, with potential developments as future therapeutic tools to treat neuro&#8208;disorders characterized by altered glutamatergic transmission. Excitotoxicity, namely cell death triggered by exceeding ambient glutamate fueling over&#8208;activation of excitatory synapses, is a pathogenic mechanism shared by several neural diseases, from ischemic stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. Here we exposed CNS cultures to oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemic stroke in vitro, and we show that the delivery of s&#8208;GO following OGD, during the endogenous build&#8208;up of secondary damage and excitotoxicity, improved neuronal survival. In a different paradigm, we reproduced excitotoxicity cell damage through exogenous glutamate application, and we observed that s&#8208;GO co&#8208;treatment protected neuronal integrity, potentially by directly downregulating the synaptic over&#8208;activation brought about by exogenous glutamate. In our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study we suggest that s&#8208;GO may find novel applications in therapeutic developments for treating excitotoxicity&#8208;driven neural cell death.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterobimetallic Complexes Bridged by an Unsymmetrical Bis(NHC) Ligand: Study of Enhanced Catalytic Activity in Tandem Transformations and Understanding of Cooperativity between the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bis(azolium) salt [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 was found to serve as a suitable platform for accessing the heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;M (M = PdII/AuI) and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes. Initially, selective mono&#8208;metalation of [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 yielded an orthometalated IrIII&#8208; or non&#8208;orthometalated PdII&#8208;complex. Sequential metalation of the mono&#8208;IrIII complex resulted in the formation of heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII/AuI complexes. Similarly, a distinct heterobimetallic PdII&#8208;IrIII complex was synthesized starting from the mono&#8208;PdII complex. Further, the corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII and PdII&#8208;PdII complexes were directly obtained from [L1&#8208;H2]Br2. Additionally, monometallic PdII and IrIII analogues were synthesized from [L2&#8208;H]Br and [L3&#8208;H]Br, respectively. The heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes were then evaluated as catalysts in various one&#8208;pot tandem catalytic reactions in which they demonstrated superior activity than the mixtures of both their corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII/PdII&#8208;PdII and monometallic IrIII/PdII counterparts, under the constant concentrations of metal centers. Moreover, while comparing complexes IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII, the former exhibits higher activity in all the studied reactions. All these findings suggest the presence of some form of cooperativity between the two metal centers (Ir and Pd) connected by a single ligand framework in IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complex, with IrIII&#8208;PdII displaying better cooperativity that has been validated by electrochemical, NMR, and DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Hydrophobicity for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) is a promising pathway for converting greenhouse gasses into valuable fuels and chemicals using intermittent renewable energy. Enormous efforts have been invested in developing and designing CO2R electrocatalysts suitable for industrial applications at accelerated reaction rates. The microenvironment, specifically the local CO2 concentration (local [CO2]) as well as the water and ion transport at the CO2&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;catalyst interface, also significantly impacts the current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and operation stability. In nature, hydrophobic surfaces of aquatic arachnids trap appreciable amounts of gas due to the &#8220;plastron effect&#8221;, which could inspire the reliable design of CO2R catalysts and devices to enrich gaseous CO2. In this review, starting from the wettability modulation, we summarize CO2 enrichment strategies to enhance CO2R. To begin, superwettability systems in nature and their inspiration for concentrating CO2 in CO2R are described and discussed. Moreover, other CO2 enrichment strategies, compatible with the hydrophobicity modulation, are explored from the perspectives of catalysts, electrolytes, and electrolyzers, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CO2 enrichment strategies is provided. We envision that this review could provide new guidance for further developments of CO2R toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretched Central Double Bonds in Dialumene and Disilene by Amino Substituents: A Case of Lone Pair Repulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The block&#8208;localized wavefunction method at the density functional theory level is employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents. The origin of the significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds in these molecules is the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond. Replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.







Abstract
There have been remarkable advances in the syntheses and applications of groups 13 and 14 homonuclear ethene analogues. However, successes are largely limited to aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Analogues bearing two or more heteroatoms are still scarce. In this work, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method at the density functional theory (DFT) level was employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents whose optimal geometries exhibit significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds compared with aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Computational analyses showed that the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond plays a critical role in the elongation of the M=M bonds. Evidently, replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Activation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative activation of carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions have become a highly popular strategy whose chemical designs span across the whole periodic table. This perspective categorizes the wide variety of systems reported and assesses their limitations and prospects to develop catalytic functionalization protocols.







Abstract
The activation and functionalization of carbon dioxide entails great interest related to its abundance, low toxicity and associated environmental problems. However, the inertness of CO2 has posed a challenge towards its efficient conversion to added&#8208;value products. In this review we discuss one of the strategies that have been widely used to capture and activate carbon dioxide, namely the use of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions by partnering a Lewis acidic and a Lewis basic fragment. This type of CO2 activation resembles that found in metalloenzymes, whose outstanding performance in catalytically transforming carbon dioxide encourages further bioinspired research. We have divided this review into three general sections based on the nature of the active sites: metal&#8208;free examples (mainly formed by frustrated Lewis pairs), main group&#8208;transition metal combinations, and transition metal heterobimetallic complexes. Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of &#946;&#8208;Naphthols using Primary Alcohols: Elucidating the Influence of Base and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed site selective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;naphthols using both arylmethanols and aliphatic alcohols as alkylating agents is reported in which water is the only byproduct. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reactions proceed via aldehyde intermediates. DFT studies revealed that the base and in&#8197;situ generated water play important roles in catalysis.







Abstract
Functionalized arenes and arenols have diverse applications in chemical synthesis and material chemistry. Selective functionalization of arenols is a topic of prime interest. In particular, direct alkylation of arenols using alcohols is a challenging task. In this report, a ruthenium pincer catalyzed direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;naphthol using primary alcohols as alkylating reagents is reported. Notably, aryl and heteroaryl methanols and linear and branched aliphatic alcohols underwent selective alkylation reactions, in which water is the only byproduct. Notably, catalytically derived &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthol products displayed high absorbance, emissive properties, and quantum yields (up to 93.2&#8201;%). Dearomative bromination on &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthol is demonstrated as a synthetic application. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves an aldehyde intermediate. DFT studies support this finding and further reveal that a stoichiometric amount of base is required to make the aldol condensation as well as elementary steps required for regeneration of catalytically active species. In situ&#8208;generated water molecule from the aldol condensation reaction plays an important role in the regeneration of an active catalyst.

         <title>FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium, alkynes were hydrated under bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents). This Fe&#8208;DES could be recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent (E factor = 10). Furthermore, the Fe&#8208;DES is able to promote the efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the system being recycled up to three consecutive times. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Presa&#8197;Soto, V. del&#8197;Amo, J. Garc&#237;a&#8208;&#193;lvarez, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301736).

Fluorination: The deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 converts carboxylic acids into acyl fluorides and is capable of difluorinating aldehydes. Experimental and computational studies show that an imidazolidinium salt bearing an F(HF)2&#8722; anion serves as crucial intermediate.







Abstract
A N&#8208;heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;2&#8208;chloroimidazolidinium chloride (3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer&#8208;sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in&#8197;situ fluorination of the generated carboxylic acid was developed.

         <title>Heterocyclic [9]Helicenes Exhibiting Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy access to brightly blue fluorescent [9]helicenes! The CPL brightness reaches up to 17&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest CPL brightness among heterocyclic helicenes.







Abstract
We describe a concise synthetic strategy for the preparation of heterocyclic [9]helicenes and a simple preparative&#8208;scale protocol for the optical resolution of the resulting M&#8208; and P&#8208;enantiomers. The helicenes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction along with a range of spectroscopic and computational techniques. A fluorescence quantum yield of up to 65&#8201;% was observed, and the chiroptical properties of both M&#8208; and P&#8208;helicenes revealed large dissymmetry factors. The circularly polarized luminescence brightness reaches up to 17&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest circularly polarized luminescence brightness among heterocyclic helicenes. We describe how chiroptical properties (both circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence) can be described and predicted using quantum chemical calculations. The synthetic approach also reveals by&#8208;products that originate from internal oxidation reactions, presumably mediated by the close proximity of the &#960;&#8208;surfaces in the helicene structure.

         <title>Preparation of Trimetallic&#8208;Organic Framework Film Electrodes via Secondary Growth for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a secondary growth strategy, FeCoNi&#8208;btz/NF electrodes, integrating cationic MOF frameworks, trimetallic coupling effects together with continuous and dense morphology, are successfully fabricated for enhanced OER performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion systems. However, developing MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still challenging. In this work, a series of MOF film electrodes derived from Ni&#8208;btz were prepared by employing the secondary growth strategy under solvothermal conditions. Fe and Co ions were also incorporated into the Ni&#8208;btz framework to produce a trimetallic coupling effect to obtain enhanced OER activity. The as&#8208;prepared FeCoNi&#8208;btz/NF exhibited not only good stability but also excellent OER performance under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the possible intermediates including metal oxides and metal oxyhydroxides were confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

         <title>Mechanical Interlocking to Unlock the Reinforcing Potential of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) improve the interaction between SWNT fillers and polymer matrix in nanocomposites. As a result, MINTs show improvements of more than 100&#8201;% on Youngs Modulus and tensile strength for polymers of different chemical nature. Classic supramolecular chemistry concepts can be used to understand the polymer&#8208;nanofiller interactions, opening the way to further optimization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) present extraordinary mechanical properties, with Youngs&#8217; modulus&gt;1&#8197;TPa and tensile strength&gt;50&#8197;GPa; this makes them ideal candidates as fillers for the reinforcement of polymers. However, the performance of SWNTs in this field has fallen behind expectations. This is due to a combination of imperfect individualization of the SWNTs and poor load transfer from the polymer to the SWNTs. Here, we study the reinforcement of polymers of different chemical nature using mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs). We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polysulfone (PSU) and their composites made with pristine SWNTs, MINTs, and the corresponding supramolecular models. With very low loading of MINTs (0.01&#8201;% w/w), improvements of more than 100&#8201;% on Youngs Modulus and the tensile strength are observed for both the nonpolar aliphatic PMMA and the very polar aromatic PSU polymers, while pristine carbon nanotubes and the supramolecular nanofillers showed smaller reinforcement. These data, together with our previous report on the reinforcement of polystyrene (nonpolar and aromatic), indicate that derivatization of SWNTs as MINTs is a valid general strategy to optimize the interaction between SWNT fillers and the polymer matrix.

A saddle&#8208;shaped macrocyclic host: An expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped structure was synthesized. It is suitable for host&#8211;guest complexation by &#960;&#8208; &#960; interactions with four equivalents of fullerene C60 in all three directions. UV/vis/NIR transient absorption spectroscopy exhibits a strong long&#8208;lived NIR absorption reminiscent of that of porphyrins but shows no porphyrin&#8208;type Q&#8208;band.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of a new type of an expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped morphology and its complexation of C60 guest molecules. The new macrocycle contains four carbazole and four triazole moieties and can be readily synthesized via a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction. It shows specific photo&#8208;physical properties including fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 60&#8201;%. The combination of the saddle&#8208;shaped geometry with the expanded &#960;&#8208;system allows for host&#8211;guest interactions with C60 in a stacked polymer fashion. Evidence for the presence of a host&#8211;guest complex is provided both in solution by NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray structure analysis.

Abstract
Access to enantioenriched tertiary and quaternary &#945;&#8208;chiral allysilanes without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst is reported. This was achieved by enantioselective allylic displacement of &#947;&#8208;silylated allylic bromides through Lewis base activation of Grignard reagents by a bidentate chiral NHC ligand. The process afforded both high &#947;&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity and is compatible with a wide range of silyl groups on the substrates.

         <title>Post&#8208;Installation of Fused Benzoheptagons at the Periphery of NiII Porphyrins: Helical Structures and Conformation&#8208;Adjustable Fullerenes Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin dimer containing two seven&#8208;membered rings in the bridging moiety was made! Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a newly developed protocol. The porphyrin dimer is in a helix state in solution on its own, but when a fullerene comes along, it curls up and catches the fullerene. The seven&#8208;membered ring at the bridging site serves to provide flexibility to the porphyrin dimer.@naist_aratani @NAIST_MS_JP







Abstract
Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a protocol consisting of (2&#8208;formyl)arylation at the meso&#8208;position(s) of NiII porphyrins, conversion of formyl group to methoxyethene group by Wittig reaction, and final Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. The structures of these porphyrins have been revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the installed heptagon ring(s), these porphyrins show curved structures with conformational flexibility. Dimer has been shown to have a small activation barrier for inversion and to capture C60 and C70 with large association constants with adjustable conformational changes.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds in Hydroxymethylfurfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in derivatives of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been developed for the arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies suggest a decarboxylative mechanism. This strategy offers an efficient and sustainable approach for the synthesis of arylfuran derivatives.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of C&#8722;C bonds in organic molecules is a powerful tool for the synthesis of value&#8208;added compounds. 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) derivatives are a promising class of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals that have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and materials. However, the selective activation of unstrained C&#8722;C bonds is a challenging task, mainly due to their relatively high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed method for the efficient C&#8722;C bond activation of HMF derivatives, enabling their arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies, including reaction&#8208;profile analysis, competition experiments and head&#8208;space IR spectroscopy suggest a decarboxylative mechanism.

         <title>Panchromatic Light&#8208;Capturing Bis&#8208;styryl BODIPY&#8208;Perylenediimide Donor&#8211;Acceptor Constructs: Occurrence of Sequential Energy Transfer Followed by Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing artificial photosynthetic model compounds featuring bisstyrylBODIPY and perylene diimide have been newly synthesized to probe excited&#8208;state energy and electron transfer. Excited&#8208;state DFT and free&#8208;energy calculations supported the occurrence of such photo events. Pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy provided the ultimate evidence wherein the measured rate constants for energy transfer were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants were in the range of 10&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting.

         <title>Boosting the oxygen evolution activity of FeNi oxides/hydroxides by molecular and atomic engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>FeNi oxides/hydroxides are the best performing catalysts for oxidizing water at basic pH. Consequently, their improvement is the cornerstone to develop more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems. During the last 5 years different reports have demonstrated an enhancement of their activity by engineering their structures via: (1) modulation of the number of oxygen, iron and nickel vacancies;(2) single atoms (SAs) doping with metals such as Au, Ir, Ru and Pt; and (3) modification of their surface using organic ligands. All these strategies have led to more active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution rection (OER). In this Concept we critically analyze these strategies using the most relevant examples.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homolytic elimination of two H atoms from two adjacent carbons in benzene results in the aromatic product o&#8208;benzyne. In a similar way, the homolytic elimination of two H atoms from the two adjacent carbons in 1,2&#8208;C2B10H12 results in the aromatic product o&#8208;carboryne. In this work, we provide experimental and computational evidences that despite the similarity of o&#8208;carboryne and o&#8208;benzyne, the nature of the C&#8211;C bond generated between two adjacent carbons that lose H atoms is different. While in o&#8208;benzyne the C&#8211;C bond behaves as a triple bond, in o&#8208;carboryne the C&#8211;C bond is a double bond. Therefore, we must stop naming o&#8208;carboryne to 1,2&#8208;dehydro&#8208;o&#8208;carborane but to call it o&#8208;carborene.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Deformed and Conformationally Rigid Phosphorus Trisamides featuring an Unsymmetrical Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonclassical P(III) centers have attracted much attention in recent years. Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers a particularly attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom that may in turn induce unusual reactivity. Although still relatively scarcely explored, phosphorus centers enforced in a non&#8208;C3 symmetry have gained significant traction lately. However, the current scaffolds are based on a relatively limited set of design principles and ligand platforms associated therewith. We herein focus on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform derived from 2&#8208;(methylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylamino)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetrical and Mixed Tris(acyl)phosphines: Synthesis, Oxidation and Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a convenient synthesis for symmetrical and mixed substituted tris(acyl)phosphines (TAPs) starting from red phosphorus. All TAPs exhibit a phosphaalkene&#8208;acylphosphine equilibrium, which was investigated in detail by variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR spectroscopy supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the substituents, two phosphaalkene derivatives and six acylphosphine derivatives could be isolated. NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography enabled a clear structural assignment of these compounds. Oxidation of selected TAPs led to the formation of the corresponding tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Furthermore, their spectroscopic properties as well as their photochemistry was investigated. Especially, the TAPO compounds were evaluated for their suitability as photoinitiators by CIDNP spectroscopy, photobleaching measurements and by storage stability tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Initial quenching efficiency determines light&#8208;driven H2 evolution of [Mo3S13]2&#8208; in lipid bilayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses reactive components embedded in biological membranes to perform light&#8208;driven photosynthesis. Here, we report a model artificial photosynthetic system for light&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. The system is based on liposomes where amphiphilic ruthenium trisbipyridine based photosensitizer (RuC9) and the H2 evolution reaction (HER) catalyst [Mo3S13]2&#8208; are embedded in biomimetic phospholipid membranes. When DMPC was used as the main lipid of these light&#8208;active liposomes, increased catalytic activity (TONCAT ~ 200) was observed compared to purely aqueous conditions. Although all tested lipid matrixes, including DMPC, DOPG, DPPC and DOPG liposomes provided similar liposomal structures according to TEM analysis, only DMPC yielded high H2 amounts. In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) measurements using Pd microsensors revealed an induction period of around 26 minutes prior to H2 evolution, indicating an activation mechanism which might be induced by the fluid&#8208;gel phase transition of DMPC at room temperature. Stern Volmer&#8208;type quenching studies revealed that electron transfer dynamics from the excited state photosensitizer are most efficient in the DMPC lipid environment giving insight for design of artificial photosynthetic systems using lipid bilayer membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Co&#8208;initiators via Base&#8208;Catalysed Sequential Conjugate Addition: Application in Photoinduced Radical Polymerisation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of a co&#8208;initiator for a type&#8208;II photoinitiator promoted photoinduced radical polymerzation reaction via a barrierless catalytic sequential conjugate addition reaction. The computational study confirms the presence of a low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap for the newly developed addition reaction. The 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol&#8208;based co&#8208;initiator turned out to be very efficient for the polymerization and the resultant polymeric material has excellent physical properties for dental restoration and 3D&#8208;printing.







Abstract
Applications of photochemistry are becoming very popular in modern&#8208;day life due to its operational simplicity, environmentally friendly and economically sustainable nature in comparison to thermochemistry. In particular photoinduced radical polymerisation (PRP) reactions are finding more biological applications and especially in the areas of dental restoration processes, tissue engineering and artificial bone generation. A type&#8208;II photoinitiator and co&#8208;initiator&#8208;promoted PRP turned out to be a cost&#8208;effective protocol, and herein we report the design and synthesis of a new efficient co&#8208;initiator for a PRP reaction via a barrierless sequential conjugate addition reaction. Experimental mechanistic observations have been further complemented by computational data. Time for newly synthesised 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol (DTH) based co&#8208;initiator promoted polymerisation of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA, 70&#8201;%) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA, 30&#8201;%) in presence of 450&#8197;nm LED (15&#8197;W) under the aerobic conditions is 38&#8197;seconds. Polymeric material has high glass transition temperature, improved mechanical strength (860 BHN) and longer in&#8208;depth polymerisation (3&#8197;cm).

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical strategy for synthesizing imines efficiently is introduced, including both symmetric and unsymmetric imines. Of note, the method is successfully applied to perform the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues, highlighting its potential in chemical biology applications. This strategy presents a convenient platform for imine synthesis with broad implications in drug development and organic synthesis.







Abstract
A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in the photoelectrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Chlorine Production Over Bismuth Oxychloride in Chloride Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the cycle of carbonate species and the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst of BiOCl play a significant role in this process. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of Cl2 production via photocatalysis.







Abstract
As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8211;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine by using solar energy and NaCl solution offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, it was found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.

         <title>Alternating Stereospecificity upon Central&#8208;Atom Change: Dynamics of the F&#8722;+PH2Cl SN2 Reaction Compared to its C&#8208; and N&#8208;Centered Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamical central&#8208;atom effects in SN2 reactions are investigated, with special regard to stereochemistry, by preforming quasi&#8208;classical trajectory simulations on a novel full&#8208;dimensional ab initio potential energy surface for the F&#8722;+PH2Cl reaction, as well as by comparing its dynamics and mechanisms to the N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered analogues.







Abstract
Central&#8208;atom effects on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions are well&#8208;known in chemistry, however, the atomic&#8208;level SN2 dynamics at phosphorous (P) centers has never been studied. We investigate the dynamics of the F&#8722;+PH2Cl reaction with the quasi&#8208;classical trajectory method on a novel full&#8208;dimensional analytical potential energy surface fitted on high&#8208;level ab initio data. Our computations reveal intermediate dynamics compared to the F&#8722;+CH3Cl and the F&#8722;+NH2Cl SN2 reactions: phosphorus as central atom leads to a more indirect SN2 reaction with extensive complex&#8208;formation with respect to the carbon&#8208;centered one, however, the title reaction is more direct than its N&#8208;centered pair. Stereospecificity, characteristic at C&#8208;center, does not appear here either, due to the submerged front&#8208;side&#8208;attack retention path and the repeated entrance&#8208;channel inversional motion, whereas the multi&#8208;inversion mechanism discovered at nitrogen center is also undermined by the deep Walden&#8208;well. At low collision energies, 6&#8201;% of the PH2F products form with retained configuration, mostly through complex&#8208;mediated mechanisms, while this ratio reaches 24&#8201;% at the highest energy due to the increasing dominance of the direct front&#8208;side mechanism and the smaller chance for hitting the deep Walden&#8208;inversion minimum. Our results suggest pronounced central&#8208;atom effects in SN2 reactions, which can fundamentally change their (stereo)dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;Central-atom effects on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2) reactions are well-known in chemistry, however, the atomic-level S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 dynamics at phosphorous (P) centers has never been studied.

Our computations reveal intermediate dynamics compared to the F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;+CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and the F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;+NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions: phosphorus as central atom leads to a more indirect S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction with extensive complex-formation with respect to the carbon-centered one, however, the title reaction is more direct than its N-centered pair. Stereospecificity, characteristic at C-center, does not appear here either, due to the submerged front-side-attack retention path and the repeated entrance-channel inversional motion, whereas the multi-inversion mechanism discovered at nitrogen center is also undermined by the deep Walden-well. At low collision energies, 6&#8201;% of the PH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F products form with retained configuration, mostly through complex-mediated mechanisms, while this ratio reaches 24&#8201;% at the highest energy due to the increasing dominance of the direct front-side mechanism and the smaller chance for hitting the deep Walden-inversion minimum.

         <title>Tracking SF5I in the Iodopentafluorosulfanylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the vibrant field of SF5 chemistry, SF5X reagents (X = F, Cl, Br) are at the heart of current investigations in radical pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. Alas! SF5I is the missing link whose existence has not been reported albeit its potential as SF5 donor. We herein report the formal addition of the hitherto unknown SF5I reagent to alkynes by means of a combination of SF5Cl / KI / 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The exclusive regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of unprecedented (E)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;l6&#8208;sulfanyl) alkenes was achieved. A consensus was reached through computational and mechanistic studies for the realistic formation of SF5&#8211; anion but not SF5I in solution and the rational involvement of SF5&#183; and iodine radicals in the iodo pentafluorosulfanylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Living Topochemical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Achiral Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;Anhydrides in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a living topochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of achiral amino&#8208;acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs). Single crystals of the NCAs of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) were grown, allowing a ring&#8208;opening polymerization macroscopically induced by amines. Single crystals could be polymerized at temperatures from 25 &#8211; 50 &#176;C after physically contacting the amine&#8208;based initiator with the crystals. Topochemical polymerization of the crystals was proven by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS and XRD, generating polymers with chain lengths of up to 40 units and a complete affixation of the initiating amine at the polymer&#8217;s head. Due to the proper alignment of the reacting groups in the crystal, longer polymer chains with improved purities can be reached, as also chain&#8208;transfer is reduced as compared to solution polymerization. Simple purification of the polymers can be achieved by separation of the unreacted NCA via dispersion in acetonitrile. Overall, this method enables the preparation of polymers with higher chain length and purities at mild conditions, finally demonstrating a crystal&#8208;based ring opening polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Aspects about &#8220;Lifetime&#8221; in Upconversion Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent progress on the temporal response (TR) of lanthanide upconversion luminescence (UCL) has enriched the means of UCL regulation, promoted advanced designs for customized applications such as biological diagnosis, high&#8208;capacity optical coding, and dynamic optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and pushed us to reacquaint the dynamic responses of sensitizer/activator ions in UCL system. In particular, the lifetime of UCL should be revisited after discovery of novel experimental phenomena and luminescence mechanisms, i.e., it should be understood as the collective TR (in the decay edge) of all the involved ions rather than the reciprocal of the radiative rate of an individual ion. In this Concept, we retraced the latest understanding of the dynamics in UCL with special attention to the relationship between excitation and emission, means of TR regulation, and discussed existing challenges. It is expected to provide some fundamental insights to deepened understanding, further regulation, and frontier applications of TR features of UCL.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Beryllium: Covalent Bonding Between s&#8208;block Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a planar hypercoordinate arrangement of s&#8208;block metals through covalent bonding with ligands is challenging due to the strong ionicity involved. Herein, we report the first case of a neutral binary global minimum containing a planar hexacoordinate beryllium (phBe) atom. The central Be atom is coordinated by six active Be atoms, latter in turn are enclosed by an equal number of more electronegative chlorine atoms in the periphery, forming a star&#8208;like phBe cluster (Be&#169;Be6Cl6). Importantly, the cluster exhibits dynamically stabilized stemming geometrically from the appropriate matching of metal&#8208;ligand size and electronically from adherence to the octet rule as well as possessing the 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Remarkably, energy decomposition analysis&#8211;natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis reveals a significant covalent interaction between the ligand and the central metal beryllium atoms, a fact further supported by a large Wiberg bond index. This cluster is a promising synthetic as its excellent electronic, dynamic and thermodynamic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Independent Ultrafast Energy Transfer in Bioinspired Arrays Containing Electronically Coupled BODIPY Dimers as Energy Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired energy&#8208;transfer arrays composed of electronically coupled BODIPY dyads as energy donors and chlorins as energy acceptors feature ultrafast (~10&#8197;ps) energy transfer, which is consistent with the F&#246;rster mechanism. The energy&#8208;transfer rate in the arrays is nearly independent of the position at which energy donor is attached to the chlorin or of the nature of the intervening linker.







Abstract
In photosynthetic light&#8208;harvesting complexes, strong interaction between chromophores enables efficient absorption of solar radiation and has been suggested to enable ultrafast energy funneling to the reaction center. To examine whether similar effects can be realized in synthetic systems, and to determine the mechanisms of energy transfer, we synthesized and characterized a series of bioinspired arrays containing strongly&#8208;coupled BODIPY dimers as energy donors and chlorin derivatives as energy acceptors. The BODIPY dimers feature broad absorption in the range of 500&#8211;600&#8197;nm, complementing the chlorin absorption to provide absorption across the entire visible spectrum. Ultrafast (~10&#8197;ps) energy transfer was observed from photoexcited BODIPY dyads to chlorin subunits. Surprisingly, the energy&#8208;transfer rate is nearly independent of the position where the BODIPY dimer is attached to the chlorin and of the type of connecting linker. In addition, the energy&#8208;transfer rate from BODIPY dimers to chlorin is slower than the corresponding rate in arrays containing BODIPY monomers. The lower rate, corresponding to less efficient through&#8208;bond transfer, is most likely due to weaker electronic coupling between the ground state of the chlorin acceptor and the delocalized electronic state of the BODIPY dimer, compared to the localized state of a BODIPY monomer.

         <title>Centrohexaindane, a Unique Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Bearing the Rare Cq(Cq)4 Core: Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centrohexaindane is an unusual molecule that has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Vibrational spectroscopy was used to explore the differences between the solution and solid state structures.







Abstract
The structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, 1, was investigated. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (Td) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of 1 are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for Td symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X&#8208;ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000&#8197;&#197;3. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with C1 site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.

Mechanistic insights are provided to explain why a seemingly tiny change in substituent can completely change the reaction product. Both reaction paths were studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and it was shown how they are affected by substitution of the substrate.

         <title>Molecular Engineering to Boost the Photo&#8208;Oxidase Activity of Molecular Rotors in Colorimetric Sensing of Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, CBPy and DAPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. The photo&#8208;oxidase activity of molecular rotors was applied for the colorimetric detection of environmental temperatures for the first time.







Abstract
Some organic dyes and photosensitizers with strong visible absorption can behave as photo&#8208;responsive oxidase mimics. However, the relationship between the photo&#8208;oxidase activity and molecular structure remains unclear to date. In this work, a new type of photosensitizer with the characteristics of molecular rotors, namely DPPy, served as the molecular scaffold for further investigation. To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, DAPy and CBPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that DAPy and CBPy both exhibited highly efficient photo&#8208;activated oxidase&#8208;like activity with 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate, which were in good accordance with their molecular engineering to promote either type I or type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Impressively a colorimetric method based on the visible light induced oxidase&#8208;like activity of molecular rotors was developed to determine the environmental temperature for the first time. Both DAPy and CBPy showed distinct sensitivities toward temperature as compared with several molecular rotors based on the typical fluorimetric detection. This work provides a new strategy for the application of molecular rotors to overcome the non&#8208;emissive challenge in temperature sensing.

         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars without templates or masks is reported. The study explores structurally Janus nanostructures with two distinct morphologies and a single&#8208;step growth process using pentatwinned seeds. The interplay of silver and bromide ions influences morphological differences. The SERS capability of Au Janus NSs was investigated; higher enhancement was shown with larger&#8208;sized particles.







Abstract
Nanostructures intrinsically possessing two different structural or functional features, often called Janus nanoparticles, are emerging as a potential material for sensing, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars (NSs) possessing a smooth concave pentagonal morphology with sharp tips and edges on one side and, contrastingly, a crumbled morphology on the other. The methodology reported herein for their synthesis &#8211; a single&#8208;step growth reaction &#8211; is different from any other Janus nanoparticle preparation involving either template&#8208;assisted growth or a masking technique. Interestingly, the coexistence of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;index facets was found in these Janus NSs. The general paradigm for synthesizing gold Janus NSs was investigated by understanding the kinetic control mechanism with the combinatorial effect of all the reagents responsible for the structure. The optical properties of the Janus NSs were realized by corelating their extinction spectra with the simulated data. The size&#8208;dependent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of these Janus NSs was studied with 1,4&#8208;BDT as the model analyte. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations for differently sized particles revealed the distribution of electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots over the particles resulting in enhancement of the SERS signal in a size&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties on a Bisbenzofuropyrazine Core: Mechanochromism and Concentration&#8208;Controlled Vapochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with luminescence switching properties have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications in sensing, security, and display devices. In this paper, bent&#8208;type bisbenzofuropyrazine derivatives, Bent&#8208;H and Bent&#8208;sBu, with good solubilities were synthesized, and their physical and optical properties were investigated in detail. Bent&#8208;H gave three crystalline polymorphs, and they showed different luminescence properties depending on their crystal packing structures. In addition, Bent&#8208;H exhibited mechanochromic luminescence in spite of its rigid skeleton. Bent&#8208;sBu exhibited unique concentration&#8208;dependent vapochromic luminescence. Ground Bent&#8208;sBu was converted to blue&#8208;emissive, green&#8208;emissive, and green&#8208;emissive high&#8208;viscosity solution states at low, moderate, and high concentrations of CHCl3 vapor, respectively. This finding represents a concentration&#8208;dependent multi&#8208;phase transition with an organic solvent, which is of potent interest for application in sensing systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;trans/cis pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(S,Sp)&#8208;iPr&#8208;FcPHOX&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5&#8208;trans selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(R,Sp)&#8208;ThioClickFerrophos complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines in high yield and enantioselectivity. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol with H2 on an iron(II)scorpionate catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 utilization is an important process in the chemical industry with great environmental power. In this work we show how CO2 and H2 can be reacted to form methanol on an iron(II) center and highlight the bottlenecks for the reaction and what structural features are essential for efficient turnover. The calculations predict the reactions to proceed through three successive reaction cycles that start with heterolytic cleavage of H2 followed by sequential hydride and proton transfer processes. The H2 splitting process is an endergonic process and hence high pressures will be needed to overcome this step and trigger the hydrogenation reaction. Moreover, H2 cleavage into a hydride and proton requires a metal to bind hydride and a nearby source to bind the proton, such as an amide or pyrazolyl group, which the scorpionate ligand used here facilitates. As such the computations highlight the non&#8208;innocence of the ligand scaffold through proton shuttle from H2 to substrate as an important step in the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;induced Conformational Changes and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Binding of Polyphenols to Proline&#8208;rich Salivary Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first contact of polyphenols (tannins) with the human body occurs in the mouth, where they are known to interact with proline&#8208;rich proteins (PRPs). These interactions are important at a sensory level, especially for the development of astringency, but affect also various other biochemical processes. Employing thermodynamic measurements, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, we investigated the binding process of the prototypical polyphenol ellagic acid (EA) to different IB&#8208;PRPs and BSA, also in the presence of ethanol, which is known to influence tannin&#8208;protein interactions. Binding of EA to BSA and the small peptide IB7&#8208;14 is weak, but very strong to IB9&#8208;37. The differences in binding strength and stoichiometry are due to differences in the binding motifs, which also lead to differences in the thermodynamic signatures of the binding process. EA binding to BSA is enthalpy&#8208;driven, whereas binding to both IB7&#8208;14 and IB9&#8208;37 is entropy&#8208;driven. The presence of 10 vol.% EtOH, as present in wines, increases the binding constant of EA with BSA and IB7&#8208;14 drastically, but not that with IB9&#8208;37, but changes the binding stoichiometry. These differences can be attributed to the effect of EtOH on the conformational dynamics of the proteins and to changes in hydration properties in alcoholic solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes in Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation/N&#8208;Methylation of Amines Using Carbon Dioxide and Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of seven Mn(I) complexes with general formula [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], having a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), has been developed by varying the bridging group between the NHC donors, the nitrogen wingtip substituents and the heterocyclic ring. The synthesis of the complexes has been accomplished by in situ transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes. Removal of the bromide anion affords the corresponding solvento complexes [Mn(bisNHC)(CO)3(CH3CN)](BF4). The influence of the bisNHC structure on its electron donor ability has been evaluated by FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, both in the neutral and cationic complexes. Finally, the isolated Mn(I)&#8208;bisNHC complexes have been employed as homogeneous catalysts in the reductive N&#8208;formylation and N&#8208;methylation of amines with CO2 as C1 source and phenylsilane as reducing agent, showing a high selectivity for the N&#8208;methylated product. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that, in the adopted reaction conditions, the formylated product can be formed via different reaction pathways, either metal&#8208;catalyzed or not, while the methylation reaction requires the use of the Mn(I) catalyst.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of seven Mn(I) complexes with general formula [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], having a bidentate bis(N-heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), has been developed by varying the bridging group between the NHC donors, the nitrogen wingtip substituents and the heterocyclic ring. The synthesis of the complexes has been accomplished by in situ transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes. Removal of the bromide anion affords the corresponding solvento complexes [Mn(bisNHC)(CO)3(CH3CN)](BF4). The influence of the bisNHC structure on its electron donor ability has been evaluated by FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, both in the neutral and cationic complexes. Finally, the isolated Mn(I)-bisNHC complexes have been employed as homogeneous catalysts in the reductive N-formylation and N-methylation of amines with CO2 as C1 source and phenylsilane as reducing agent, showing a high selectivity for the N-methylated product. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that, in the adopted reaction conditions, the formylated product can be formed via different reaction pathways, either metal-catalyzed or not, while the methylation reaction requires the use of the Mn(I) catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Quinone Compounds Derived from Doubly&#8208; and Triply&#8208;Linked Diporphyrins and Tuning of Their Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins are attracting increasing attention in materials science and photochemistry owing to their unique properties and diverse applications. This study focuses on modifying and tuning the absorption properties of porphyrins, specifically those of quinoidal porphyrins, to extend their spectral range into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. We report the synthesis and structural and physical properties of quinone compounds derived from doubly&#8208; and triply&#8208;linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes. Doubly&#8208;linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties in solution owing to its low symmetry. Metal complexation markedly extends its absorption range to the near&#8208;infrared region. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply&#8208;linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. The longest absorption wavelength of the triply&#8208;linked diporphyrinquinones was approximately 1500 nm, which was significantly more red&#8208;shifted than that of the doubly&#8208;linked ones.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities. Catalyst efficiency was determined using two model oxidation and reduction reactions. For the aza&#8208;Henry reaction, cyanines bearing an amino group on the heptamethine chain allowed to obtain the best results. For trifluoromethylation, the stability of the photocatalyst was found to be the key parameter for efficient and rapid conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of (Cyclopentadienone)iron Complexes Containing a Stereogenic Plane and a Stereogenic Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of several chiral (cyclopentadienone)iron complexes (CICs) featuring either two (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxes or a combination of one (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxis and a stereogenic plane. The stereoplane&#8208;containing CICs were obtained as epimer mixtures, which were separated by flash column chromatography and assigned an absolute configuration based on XRD analysis, NMR and order of elution. The library was tested in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones showing good catalytic activity and a moderate stereoselectivity which, notably, is mostly imparted by the stereogenic plane. Indeed, the two epimers of each CIC possessing a stereoplane show opposite and equally strong stereochemical preference.</dc:description>

         <title>Yet Another Case of Lithium Metal Atoms and Germanium Atoms Sharing Chemistry in the Solid State: Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Ba2LiGe3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several Ba&#8211;Li&#8211;Ge ternary phases are known and structurally characterized, including the title compound Ba2LiGe3. Its structure is reported to contain [Ge6]10&#8211; anions that exhibit delocalized bonding with a H&#252;ckel&#8208;like aromatic character. The Ge atoms are in the same plane with the Li atoms, and if both types of atoms are considered as covalently bonded, [LiGe3]4&#8211; honeycomb&#8208;like layers will result. The latter are separated by slabs of Ba2+ cations. However, based on the systematic work detailed herein, it is necessary to re&#8208;evaluate the phase as Ba2Li1&#8211;xGe3+x (x &lt; 0.05). Although small, the homogeneity range is clearly demonstrated in the gradual change of the unit cell for four independent samples. Subsequent characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods shows that the Ba2Li1&#8211;xGe3+x structure, responds to the varied number of valence electrons and the changes are most pronounced for the refined lengths of the Li&#8211;Ge and Ge&#8211;Ge bonds. Indirectly, the changes in the Ge&#8211;Li/Ge distances within layers affect the stacking too, and these changes can be correlated to the variation of the c&#8208;cell parameter. Chemical bonding analysis based on TB&#8208;LMTO&#8208;ASA level calculations affirms the notion for covalent character of the Ge&#8211;Ge bonds; the Ba&#8211;Ge and Li&#8211;Ge interactions also show some degree of covalency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Activation of Inert Iron Oxide Basal Planes through Heterostructure Formation and Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron oxides have emerged as a very promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to precious metal catalysts for hydrogen production. However, the inert basal plane of iron oxides needs to be activated to enhance their catalytic efficiency. In this study, we employed heterostructure engineering and doped nickel to cooperatively activate the basal planes of iron oxide (Ni&#8208;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs) to achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ni&#8208;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent basic HER activity and stability, such as an extremely low overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density and corresponding Tafel slope of 58.6 mV dec&#8208;1. The increase in electrocatalyst activity and acceleration of hydrogen precipitation kinetics arises from the dual modulation of Ni doping and heterostructure, which not only modulates the electrocatalyst's electronic structure, but also increases the number and exposure of active sites. Remarkably, the generation of heterogeneous structure makes the catalyst stable. The Ni&#8208;doped catalyst has not only increased HER activity but also low&#8208;temperature resistance. These results suggest that the synergistic activation of inert iron oxide basal planes through heterostructure formation and doping is a feasible strategy. Furthermore, for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, this technique can be extended to other non&#8208;noble metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of Sulfonylarenes with Alkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to be induced by photoirradiation. Here various types of alkylamines such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines and N&#8208;alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals and make a radical chain operative.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Flexible and Self&#8208;Healing Supercapacitor Enabled by Physically Crosslinking Polymer Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self&#8208;healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross&#8208;linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self&#8208;healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8 mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8208;situ growth of electrode film, a non&#8208;laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability. Due to the non&#8208;laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1 mF/cm2 and the capacitance retention was 80% after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. The pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self&#8208;healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self&#8208;healing.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface modification functionalized carbon dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) smaller than 10 nm constitute a new type of fluorescent carbon&#8208;based nanomaterial. They have attracted much attention owing to their unique structures and excellent photoelectric properties. Primitive CDs usually comprise carbon and oxygen and are synthesized in one step from various natural products or synthetic organic compounds, usually via microwave or hydrothermal methods. However, the uniformity of surface functional groups often make CDs lack the diversity of active sites required for specific applications. Therefore, the functionalization of CDs by specific groups is a powerful strategy for improving their photophysical and photochemical properties. This paper reviews surface modification strategies to overcome these shortcomings. Functionalizing CDs using covalent or non&#8208;covalent modification can give them unique properties and broaden their applicability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have developed an original blue&#8208;light mediated ironcatalyzed oxy&#8208;phosphinylation of activated alkenes by secondary phosphine oxides under air at room temperature. Various &#946;ketophosphine oxides were then obtained in 43&#8208;97% isolated yields. Control experiments revealed that radical process is involved in the mechanism.</dc:description>
