      <title>Phosphorescent trinuclear Pt&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pt complexes: Insight into photophysical, electrochemical properties and interaction with guanine nucleobase</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we focus on the comparative photophysical and electrochemical properties of two isomeric heterotrinuclear platinum(II)&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;platinum(II) complexes (3, 6) and&#160; four intermediate isomeric homonuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (1 &#8208; 2, 4 &#8208; 5). The isomerisation originates from the positional change of aldehyde moiety, CH  2  &#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine and Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit that remain appended at cyclometalated or ancillary ligand end. The interaction with 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP with trinuclear complexes 3 and 6 shows that platinum centres appended with cyclometalated ligand in 3 facilitates the binding of two 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP unit/Pt(II) centre in preference to single unit/Pt(II) centre in 6. The 1:2 vs. 1:1 (Pt(II):5&#8217;&#8208;GMP) binding is probably due to the convenient disposal of Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit towards different planes in 3.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we focus on the comparative photophysical and electrochemical properties of two isomeric heterotrinuclear platinum(II)&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;platinum(II) complexes (3, 6) and&#160; four intermediate isomeric homonuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (1 &#8208; 2, 4 &#8208; 5). The isomerisation originates from the positional change of aldehyde moiety, CH  2  &#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine and Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit that remain appended at cyclometalated or ancillary ligand end.

      <title>Synthesis and optimization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (MOFs/ZIFs) and their post&#8208;synthesis modified nanostructures, such as oxides, hydroxides and carbons have generated significant interest for electrocatalytic reactions. In this work, we report a high and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance from bimetallic Zn100&#8208;xCox&#8208;ZIF samples directly, without carrying out high&#8208;temperature calcination and/or carbonization. ZIFs can be reproducibly and readily synthesized in large scale at ambient conditions. The bimetallic ZIFs show a systematic and gradually improved OER activity with increasing cobalt concentration. A further increase in OER activity is evidenced in ZIF&#8208;67 polyhedrons with controlled particle size of &lt;200 nm among samples of different sizes between 50 nm and 2 &#181;m. Building on this, a significantly enhanced, &gt;50%, OER activity is obtained in ZIF&#8208;67/carbon black, which shows a low&#8208;overpotential of ~320 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Such activity is comparable or better to numerous MOFs/ZIFs derived electrocatalysts. The optimized ZIF&#8208;67 sample also exhibits increased activity and durability over 24 h, which is attributed to in&#8208;situ developed active cobalt&#8208;oxide/oxyhydroxide related nanophase.</dc:description>

      <title>High Energy Proton Beam&#8208;Induced Polymerization/Oxygenation of Hydroxynaphthalenes on Meteorites and Nitrogen Transfer from Urea: Modeling Insoluble Organic Matter?</title>
      <dc:description>Formation and structural modification of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxyPAHs) by UV irradiation on minerals have recently been proposed as a possible channel of PAH transformation in astrochemical and prebiotic scenarios of possible relevance for the origin of life. Herein, we demonstrate that high energy proton beam irradiation in the presence of various meteorites, including stony iron, achondrite, and chondrite type, promotes the conversion of two representative oxyPAH compounds, 1&#8208;naphthol (1&#8208;HN) and 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1,8&#8208;DHN), into complex mixtures of oxygenated and oligomeric derivatives. Main identified products include polyhydroxy derivatives, isomeric dimers encompassing benzofuran and benzopyran scaffolds, and, notably, a range of quinones and perylene derivatives. Addition of urea, a prebiotically&#8208;relevant chemical precursor, expanded the range of identified species to include, among others, quinone diimines. Proton beam irradiation of oxyPAH, as modulated by nitrogen containing compound like urea, is proposed as a possible contributory mechanism for the formation and processing of insoluble organic matter (IOM) in meteorites and in prebiotic processes</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric control of naphthalene diimide encapsulation and electron transfer in porphyrin containers: photophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <dc:description>The complexation processes of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene diimide (NDI) into two types of &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich molecular containers consisting of two Zn(II)&#8208;porphyrins connected by four flexible linkers of two different lengths, were characterized by means of absorption and emission spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulation. Noteworthy, the addition of NDI leads to a strong quenching of the fluorescence of both cages only when they are in an open conformation suitable for guest encapsulation, a situation triggered by silver(I) ions binding to the lateral triazoles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the fast binding of NDI, likely assisted by NDI&#8208;silver(I) interactions. Upon NDI complexation, the two porphyrin macrocycles get closer, with an optimized face to face orientation, suggesting an induced&#8208;fit mechanism through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with the NDI aromatic cycle. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments allowed to identify the process of quenching of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin fluorescence as an efficient photoinduced electron transfer reaction between the cage porphyrin and the included NDI guest. The process occurs on fast and ultrafast time scales in the two complexes (1.5 ps and &#8804; 300 fs) leading to a short&#8208;lived charge separated state (charge recombination lifetimes in the order of 30&#8208;40 ps). The combined computational and experimental approach used here is able to furnish a reliable model of the NDI&#8208;cage complexation mechanism and of the corresponding electron transfer reaction, attesting the allosteric control of both processes by the silver(I) ions.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Electroactive Organic Building Blocks for the Chemical Design of Functional Porous Frameworks (MOFs and COFs) in Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Electroactive organic molecules exhibiting electrical conductivity, redox&#8208;activity, optical or magnetic properties have emerged in recent years as promising building blocks for the design of crystalline porous frameworks, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with numerous functions in electronics. In this Review, the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials for application in electronics are summarized with special emphasis on their electronic structure and function relationships. For more details see the Review by J. Rocha, M. Souto et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;10912&#8197;ff.

      <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation has emerged as one of the most efficient tools for the formation of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, avoiding the use of prefunctionalized materials. However, stoichiometric quantities of toxic and/or costly chemical redox reagents are largely required for oxidative C&#8722;H activations. Recently, electrosynthesis has experienced a remarkable renaissance, enabling the use of storable, safe and waste&#8208;free electric current as a redox equivalent. Nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activations avoid substrate prefunctionalizations and chemical oxidants by electricity. For more details see the Minireview by L.

      <dc:description>
Photoactivatable carbon&#8208;monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (photoCORMs) are currently being intensively explored as therapeutically relevant pro&#8208;drugs because this approach may lead to a safe and controllable release of carbon monoxide. In this context, a green&#8208;fluorescent ruthenium(II) complex was designed as carrier for carbon monoxide and as molecular probe for monitoring the uptake in cells. Irradiation with UV&#8208;A light triggered the desired decarbonylation with a rather unexpected outcome. For more details see the Full Paper by H. Stephan, M.

      <title>Enhanced Macroanion Recognition of Superchaotropic Keggin Clusters Achieved by Synergy of Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction and Anion&#8208;Cation Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Keggin clusters are the most widely used polyoxomatales building blocks for construction advanced materials, while effective methods of precisely recognizing the isostructural analogues of Keggins are still limited. Here we applied zwitterionic molecule 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;N,N'&#8208;dioxide (dpdo) as a recognition receptor to specifically bind with the three Keggin analogues, PW12O403&#8208;, PMo12O403&#8208; and SiW12O404&#8208;, which co&#8208;assembled into three groups of spherical charged colloids with different sizes, separately. The recognition phenomena were further confirmed by electrochemistry study and crystallization behaviors. Compared with sole anion&#8208;cation interaction driven systems, the synergism from anion&#8208;&#960; adsorption between the superchaotropic Keggins and the electro&#8208;deficient pyridine rings is believed to enhance the recognition phenomenon. The observation is intriguing as the long&#8208;range solution assembly of Keggins is mainly driven by the short&#8208;range anion&#8208;&#960; interaction. Our results show that the little&#8208;noticed hydration shell of Keggins was significantly influenced by the superchaotropic effect, leading to differentiated binding affinity to the receptors and more obvious recognition phenomena between W/Mo Keggin analogues.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Producing stable but active materials is one of the enduring challenges in electrocatalysis and other types of catalysis. Producing branched nanoparticles is one potential solution. Controlling the number of branches and branch size of faceted branched nanoparticles is one of the major synthetic challenges to achieve highly active and stable nanocatalysts.

      <dc:description>L  imited avenue is available for properties control on carbonized polymer dots (PDs) due to unsatisfactory understanding of PDs&#8217; formation. Herein, a de novo &#8216;Polymer Template&#8217; strategy is presented for PDs with customizable functional surface groups (FSG), size and underlying fluorescence, via detail mechanism assisted.

Benefited from these specific reactions, the DASPs were convenient for mass production and stable for storage, and could be transformed to PDs upon nucleophilic agents via nucleophilic addition and substitution at 70  o  C. By regulating the types of alkenyl azides, nucleophilic agents and reaction condition, the as&#8208;prepare PDs could be tailored with controlled types of core, FSG and particle size, as well as fluorescence properties of quantum yield from 8.2 &#8208; 55.6%, and emission maximum from 380 &#8208; 500 nm. These specialties make &#8216;Polymer Template&#8217; strategy a promising star for PDs&#8208;based sensor building platform. Moreover, the strategy could further our understanding towards PDs&#8217; formation, and open up a new way to customize PDs for specific needs in fields of analysis, catalysis, images, etc.</dc:description>

      <title>Ionic liquids with more than one metal: optical and electrochemical properties vs. d&#8208;metal combinations</title>
      <dc:description>Thirteen N&#8208;butylpyridinium salts, including three monometallic [C4Py]2[MCl4], nine bimetallic [C4Py]2[M1&#8208;xaMxbCl4] and one trimetallic compound [C4Py]2[M1&#8208;y&#8208;zaMybMzcCl4] (M = Co, Cu, Mn; x = 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 and y = z = 0.33), were synthesized and their structure and thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 69 and 93&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction proves that all ILs are isostructural. The conductivity at room temperature is between 10&#8208;4 and 10&#8208;8 S cm&#8208;1. Some Cu&#8208;based ILs reach conductivities of 10&#8208;2 S cm&#8208;1, which is, however, probably due to IL dec. This correlates with the optical band&#8208;gap measurements indicating the formation of large band gap semiconductors. At elevated temperatures approaching the melting points, the conductivities reach up to 1.47 &#8729; 10&#8208;1 S cm&#8208;1 at 70 &#186;C. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2.5 and 3.0 V.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional NiIr@N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocomposites Supported on Ni Foam for Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting can provide a promising avenue for sustainable hydrogen production. Highly efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely important for the practical application of water splitting technology. Here we report a one&#8208;step annealing strategy for the fabrication of a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived bifunctional self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst, which is composed of two&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;wrapped Ir&#8208;doped Ni nanoparticle composites supported on Ni foam (NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF). The resultant NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF displays excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotentials of 32 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for HER and 329 mV at 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  for OER. Particularly, the HER&#8208;OER bifunctional NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF needs only 1.50 V to yield 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Conversion from Heterometallic to Homometallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Two new heterometallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), LnZnTPO, and two homometallic MOFs, LnTPO (Ln=Eu or Tb; H3TPO=tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)phosphine oxide) were synthesized, and their structures and properties were analyzed.

Abstract
Two new heterometallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), LnZnTPO 1 and 2, and two homometallic MOFs, LnTPO 3 and 4 (Ln=Eu for 1 and 3, and Tb for 2 and 4; H3TPO=tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)phosphine oxide) were synthesized, and their structures and properties were analyzed. They were prepared by solvothermal reaction of the C3&#8208;symmetric ligand H3TPO with the corresponding metal ion(s) (a mixture of Ln3+ and Zn2+ for 1 and 2, and Ln3+ alone for 3 and 4). Single&#8208;crystal XRD (SXRD) analysis revealed that 1 and 3 are isostructural to 2 and 4, respectively. TGA showed that the framework is thermally stable up to about 400&#8201;&#176;C for 1 and 2, and about 450&#8201;&#176;C for 3 and 4. PXRD analysis showed their pore&#8208;structure distortions without noticeable framework&#8211;structure changes during drying processes. The shapes of gas sorption isotherms for 1 and 3 are almost identical to those for 2 and 4, respectively. Solvothermal immersion of 1 and 2 in Tb3+ and Eu3+ solutions resulted in the framework metal&#8208;ion exchange affording 4 and 3, respectively, as confirmed by photoluminescence (PL), PXRD, IR, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;AES), and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) analyses.

&lt;p&gt;Two new heterometallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), LnZnTPO &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and two homometallic MOFs, LnTPO &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; (Ln=Eu for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, and Tb for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;; H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPO=tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)phosphine oxide) were synthesized, and their structures and properties were analyzed. They were prepared by solvothermal reaction of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;symmetric ligand H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPO with the corresponding metal ion(s) (a mixture of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; alone for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). Single&#8208;crystal XRD (SXRD) analysis revealed that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are isostructural to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. TGA showed that the framework is thermally stable up to about 400&#8201;&#176;C for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and about 450&#8201;&#176;C for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. PXRD analysis showed their pore&#8208;structure distortions without noticeable framework&#8211;structure changes during drying processes. The shapes of gas sorption isotherms for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are almost identical to those for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Solvothermal immersion of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; solutions resulted in the framework metal&#8208;ion exchange affording &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, respectively, as confirmed by photoluminescence (PL), PXRD, IR, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;AES), and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Explaining Cu@Pt Bimetallic Nanoparticles Activity Based on NO Adsorption</title>

Abstract
Cu@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are experimentally regarded as improved catalysts for NOx storage/reduction, with higher activities and selectivities compared with pure Pt or Cu NPs, and with inverse Pt@Cu NPs. Here, a density functional theory&#8208;based study on such NP models with different sizes and shapes reveals that the observed enhanced stability of Cu@Pt compared with Pt@Cu NPs is due to energetic reasons. On both types of core@shell NPs, charge is transferred from Cu to Pt, strengthening the NP cohesion energy in Pt@Cu NPs, and spreading charge along the surface in Cu@Pt NPs. The negative surface Pt atoms in the latter diminish the NO bonding owing to an energetic rise of the Pt bands, as detected by the appliance of the d&#8208;band model, although other factors, such as atomic low coordination or the presence of an immediate subsurface Pt atom do as well. A charge density difference analysis discloses a donation/back&#8208;donation mechanism in the NO adsorption.

      <title>Sequence Decoding of 1D to 2D Self&#8208;Assembling Cyclic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>The inherent ability of peptides to self&#8208;assemble with directional and rationally predictable interactions has fostered a plethora of synthetic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular biomaterials. However, the design of peptides with hierarchical assembly in different dimensions across mesoscopic lengths remains a challenging task. We here describe the structural exploration of a D/L&#8208;alternating cyclic octapeptide capable of assembling one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanotubes in water, which subsequently pack laterally to form giant 2D nanosheets up to 500 &#181;m long with a constant 3.2 nm thickness. Specific amino acid mutations allowed the mapping of structure&#8208;assembly relationships that determine 2D self&#8208;assembly. Nine peptide modifications were studied, revealing key features in the peptide sequence that nanosheets tolerated, while a total of three peptide variants included modifications that compromised their 2D arrangement.

      <title>Ligand Selectivity by Inserting GCGC&#8208;tetrads Into G&#8208;quadruplex Structures</title>
      <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) assembled form tandem G&#8208;rich repeat sequences exhibit significant biological functions and applications, which may well depend on their structural features, such as the planar arrangement of G&#8208;tetrads and flexibility of loop regions. It has been found that cytosine&#8208;intercalated G&#8208;repeat sequences also assemble to be quadruplex structures, involving the formation of nonplanar GCGC&#8208;tetrads. Herein, to investigate the effect of GCGC&#8208;tetrads on structural properties of G4s, some previously studied quadruplexes with or without GCGC&#8208;tetrads were selected, and were used to interact with various developed G4 ligands. Our data show that stacked G&#8208;tetrads in quadruplexes are important for the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, thus promoting the combination with end&#8208;stacking ligands, such as porphyrins or planar small molecules. This is confirmed by the fact that the quadruplex formed by d(GGGCT4GGGC) with two internal G&#8208;tetrads and two external GCGC&#8208;tetrads can bind to planar ligands in the presence of specific G4&#8208;stabilizing cations, including K+ and Pb2+, and can realize the sensitive detection of Pb2+. However, the quadruplex composed of two external G&#8208;tetrads and two internal GCGC&#8208;tetrads formed by d(GCGGT3GCGG) facilitates the binding of nonplanar ligands, such as triphenylmethane (TPM) dyes, owing to the structural flexibility induced by internal GCGC&#8208;tetrads.

      <title>Highly Chemoselective Esterification from O&#8208;Aminoallylation of Carboxylic Acids: Metal&#8208; and Reagent&#8208;Free Hydrocarboxylation of Allenamides</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free hydrocarboxylation of allenamides with various functionalized carboxylic acids were achieved with complete regio&#8208; and stereocontrol (&gt;49:1). This environmentally compatible transformation affords &#947;&#8208;acyloxyenamides with exclusive E &#8208;selectivity. Electron rich, electron poor, aliphatic, aryl, and heterocyclic carboxylic acids all gave excellent yields (av 89%, 47 examples). We demonstrate the synthetic potential of this transformation in the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural carboxylic acids and simple modification of the products to three&#8208;carbon synthons with ample opportunity for further diversification. DFT study revealed that the reaction occurs in a step&#8208;wise manner through the intermediacy of a conjugated iminum species, which is rapidly captured by the carboxylate ion, resulting in the observed linear selectivity.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8208;free hydrocarboxylation of allenamides with various functionalized carboxylic acids were achieved with complete regio&#8208; and stereocontrol (&amp;gt;49:1). This environmentally compatible transformation affords &#947;&#8208;acyloxyenamides with exclusive E &#8208;selectivity. Electron rich, electron poor, aliphatic, aryl, and heterocyclic carboxylic acids all gave excellent yields (av 89%, 47 examples). We demonstrate the synthetic potential of this transformation in the late&#8208;stage modification of complex natural carboxylic acids and simple modification of the products to three&#8208;carbon synthons with ample opportunity for further diversification. DFT study revealed that the reaction occurs in a step&#8208;wise manner through the intermediacy of a conjugated iminum species, which is rapidly captured by the carboxylate ion, resulting in the observed linear selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>A series of ammonium monosubstituted  H  &#8208;phosphonate salts were synthesized by combining  H&#8208;  phosphonate diesters with amines in the absence of solvent at 80&#176;C.

      <title>Direct observation of dynamic interactions between orientation&#8208;controlled nucleosomes in a DNA origami frame</title>
      <dc:description>The nucleosome is one of the most fundamental units involved in gene expression and consequent cell development, differentiation, and expression of cell functions. We report here a method to place reconstituted nucleosomes into a DNA origami frame for direct observation using high&#8208;speed atomic&#8208;force microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM). Using this method, multiple nucleosomes can be incorporated into a DNA origami frame and real&#8208;time movement of nucleosomes can be visualized. The arrangement and conformation of nucleosomes and the distance between two nucleosomes can be designed and controlled. In addition, four nucleosomes can be placed in a DNA frame. Multiple nucleosomes were well accessible in each conformation, and interactions were observed between them. Neither mica surface modification nor chemical fixation of nucleosomes is used in this method, meaning that the DNA frame not only holds nucleosomes, but also retains their natural state. This method offers a promising platform for investigating nucleosome interactions and studying chromatin structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;sensitive self&#8208;assembled tubules based on lysine&#8208;derived surfactants for delivery of anti&#8208;microbial proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Drug delivery vectors based on amphiphiles have important features such as versatile physicochemical properties and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Amino acid&#8208;based surfactants are especially promising amphiphiles due to their enhanced biocompatibility compared to conventional surfactants. They can self&#8208;organize into micelles, vesicles and complex hierarchical structures, such as fibers, twisted and coiled ribbons, and tubules. In this work, we investigated the self&#8208;assembly and drug loading properties of a family of novel anionic double&#8208;tailed lysine&#8208;derived surfactants, with variable degree of tail length mismatch, designated as  m  Lys10 and 10Lys  n  , where  m  and  n  are the carbon atoms in the tails. These surfactants form tubular aggregates with assorted morphologies in water that undergo gelation due to dense entanglement, as evidenced by light and electron microscopy. Lysozyme (LZM), an enzyme with antimicrobial properties, was selected as model protein for loading. After the characterization of the interfacial properties and phase behavior of the amphiphiles, the LZM&#8208;loading ability of the tubules was investigated, under varying experimental conditions, to assess the efficiency of the aggregates as pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive nanocarriers. Further, the toxicological profile of the surfactants  per se  and surfactant/LZM hydrogels was obtained, using human skin fibroblasts (BJ&#8208;5ta cell line). Overall, the results show that the tubule&#8208;based hydrogels exhibit very interesting properties for the transport and controlled release of molecules of therapeutic interest.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drug delivery vectors based on amphiphiles have important features such as versatile physicochemical properties and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Amino acid&#8208;based surfactants are especially promising amphiphiles due to their enhanced biocompatibility compared to conventional surfactants. They can self&#8208;organize into micelles, vesicles and complex hierarchical structures, such as fibers, twisted and coiled ribbons, and tubules. In this work, we investigated the self&#8208;assembly and drug loading properties of a family of novel anionic double&#8208;tailed lysine&#8208;derived surfactants, with variable degree of tail length mismatch, designated as  m  Lys10 and 10Lys  n  , where  m  and  n  are the carbon atoms in the tails. These surfactants form tubular aggregates with assorted morphologies in water that undergo gelation due to dense entanglement, as evidenced by light and electron microscopy. Lysozyme (LZM), an enzyme with antimicrobial properties, was selected as model protein for loading. After the characterization of the interfacial properties and phase behavior of the amphiphiles, the LZM&#8208;loading ability of the tubules was investigated, under varying experimental conditions, to assess the efficiency of the aggregates as pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive nanocarriers. Further, the toxicological profile of the surfactants  per se  and surfactant/LZM hydrogels was obtained, using human skin fibroblasts (BJ&#8208;5ta cell line). Overall, the results show that the tubule&#8208;based hydrogels exhibit very interesting properties for the transport and controlled release of molecules of therapeutic interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Photochemistry in real space: batho&#8208; and hypsochromism in the water dimer</title>
      <dc:description>The development of chemical intuition in photochemistry faces several difficulties which result from the inadequacy of the one&#8208;particle picture, the Born&#8208;Oppenheimer approximation, and other basic notions used to build models. We show herein how real space approaches can be efficiently used to get valuables insights in photochemistry via a simple example of red and blue shift effects: the double hypso&#8208; and bathochromic shift in the low&#8208;lying valence excited states of (H2O) 2 . We demonstrate that (i) the use of these techniques allows to maintain the perturbative language used in the theory of intermolecular interactions even in the strongly interacting short&#8208;range regime; (ii) that it is one and only one molecule that gets photoexcited in each of the addressed excited states and (iii) that the electrostatic interaction

between the in&#8208;the&#8208;cluster molecular dipoles provides a fairly intuitive rationalization of the observed batho&#8208; and hypsochromism. The methods exploited and illustrated in this paper are able to maintain the individuality as well as the properties of the interacting entities in a molecular aggregate, and thereby they allow to keep and build chemical intuition in general states, at any geometry and using a broad variety of electronic structure methods.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ Mass Spectrometric and Kinetic Investigations of Soai's Asymmetric Autocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reactions that lead to a spontaneous symmetry breaking or amplification of the enantiomeric excess are of fundamental interest in explaining the formation of a homochiral world. An outstanding example is Soai&#8217;s asymmetric autocatalysis, in which small enantiomeric excesses of the added product alcohol are amplified in the reaction of diisopropylzinc and pyrimidine&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehydes. The exact mechanism is still in dispute due to complex reaction equilibria and elusive intermediates. In situ high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometric measurements, detailed kinetic analyses and doping with in situ reacting reaction mixtures, show the transient formation of hemiacetal complexes, which can establish an autocatalytic cycle. We propose a mechanism that explains the autocatalytic amplification involving these hemiacetal complexes. Comprehensive kinetic experiments and modelling of the hemiacetal formation and the Soai reaction allow the precise prediction of the reaction progress, the enantiomeric excess as well as the enantiomeric excess dependent time shift in the induction period. Experimental structural data give insights into the privileged properties of the pyrimidyl units and the formation of diastereomeric structures leading to an efficient amplification of even minimal enantiomeric excesses, respectively.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Fire and bicy: The thermal and impact sensitiveness of a series of carboxy&#8208;, hydroxymethyl&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;substituted cages were examined through sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry and hammer impact tests. The results reveal that these often&#8208;popular synthetic intermediates and functional groups can present some safety issues if not handled, stored, or used with care.







Abstract
With the burgeoning interest in cage motifs for bioactive molecule discovery, and the recent disclosure of 1,4&#8208;cubane&#8208;dicarboxylic acid impact sensitivity, more research into the safety profiles of cage scaffolds is required. Therefore, the impact sensitivity and thermal decomposition behavior of judiciously selected starting materials and synthetic intermediates of cubane, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (BCO) were evaluated via hammer test and sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. Iodo&#8208;substituted systems were found to be more impact sensitive, whereas hydroxymethyl substitution led to more rapid thermodecomposition. Cubane was more likely to be impact sensitive with these substituents, followed by BCP, whereas all BCOs were unresponsive. The majority of derivatives were placed substantially above Yoshida thresholds&#8212;a computational indicator of sensitivity.

      <title>Generating Excess Protons in Microsolvated Acid Clusters under Ambient Conditions: An Issue of Configurational Entropy versus Internal Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Temperature dependent: Extensive ab initio path integral simulations disclose that the number of water molecules required to allow for acid dissociation, and thus for the generation of hydrated excess protons, in restricted aqueous environments such as finite HCl(H2O)n clusters, is temperature dependent.







Abstract
Acid dissociation, and thus liberation of excess protons in small water droplets, impacts on diverse fields such as interstellar, atmospheric or environmental chemistry. At cryogenic temperatures below 1&#8197;K, it is now well established that as few as four water molecules suffice to dissociate the generic strong acid HCl, yet temperature&#8208;driven recombination sets in simply upon heating that cluster. Here, the fundamental question is posed of how many more water molecules are required to stabilize a hydrated excess proton at room temperature. Ab initio path integral simulations disclose that not five, but six water molecules are needed at 300&#8197;K to allow for HCl dissociation independently from nuclear quantum effects. In order to provide the molecular underpinnings of these observations, the classical and quantum free energy profiles were decomposed along the dissociation coordinate in terms of the corresponding internal energy and entropy profiles. What decides in the end about acid dissociation, and thus ion pair formation, in a specific microsolvated water cluster at room temperature is found to be a fierce competition between classical configurational entropy and internal energy, where the former stabilizes the undissociated state whereas the latter favors dissociation. It is expected that these are generic findings with broad implications on acid&#8211;base chemistry depending on temperature in small water assemblies.

At cryogenic temperatures below 1&#8197;K, it is now well established that as few as four water molecules suffice to dissociate the generic strong acid HCl, yet temperature&#8208;driven recombination sets in simply upon heating that cluster. Here, the fundamental question is posed of how many more water molecules are required to stabilize a hydrated excess proton at room temperature. Ab initio path integral simulations disclose that not five, but six water molecules are needed at 300&#8197;K to allow for HCl dissociation independently from nuclear quantum effects. In order to provide the molecular underpinnings of these observations, the classical and quantum free energy profiles were decomposed along the dissociation coordinate in terms of the corresponding internal energy and entropy profiles. What decides in the end about acid dissociation, and thus ion pair formation, in a specific microsolvated water cluster at room temperature is found to be a fierce competition between classical configurational entropy and internal energy, where the former stabilizes the undissociated state whereas the latter favors dissociation. It is expected that these are generic findings with broad implications on acid&#8211;base chemistry depending on temperature in small water assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Mechanistic Study of the Multiple Roles of Oleic Acid in the Oil&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Pt Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Oleic acid (OAc) is commonly used as a surfactant and/or solvent for the oil&#8208;phase synthesis of metal nanocrystals but its explicit roles are yet to be resolved. Here we report a systematic study of this problem by focusing on a synthesis that simply involves heating of Pt(acac)  2  in OAc for the generation of Pt nanocrystals. When heated at 80  o  C, the ligand exchange between Pt(acac)  2  and OAc leads to the formation of a Pt  II  &#8211;oleate complex that serves as the actual precursor to Pt atoms. Upon increasing the temperature to 120  o  C, the decarbonylation of OAc produces CO, which can act as a reducing agent for the generation of Pt atoms and thus formation of nuclei. Afterwards, several catalytic reactions can take place on the surface of the Pt nuclei to produce more CO, which also serves as a capping agent for the formation of Pt nanocrystals enclosed by {100} facets. The emergence of Pt nanocrystals further promotes the autocatalytic surface reduction of Pt  II  precursor to enable the continuation of growth. This work not only elucidates the critical roles of OAc at different stages in a synthesis of Pt nanocrystals but also represents a pivotal step forward toward the rational synthesis of metal nanocrystals.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract: With [Mo(N2)(P2MePP2Ph)] the first Chatt&#8208;type complex with one coordination site catalytically converting N2 to ammonia is presented. Employing SmI2 as reductant and H2O as proton source 26 equivalents of ammonia are generated.

These findings are interpreted by analyzing structural and spectroscopic features of the employed systems, leading to the conclusion that the catalytic activity of the title complex is due to the strong activation of N2 and the unique topology of the pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) ligand P2MePP2Ph. The analogous hydrazido(2&#8208;) complex [Mo(NNH2)(P2MePP2Ph)](BArF)2 is generated by protonation with HBArF in ether and characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy. Importantly, it is shown to be catalytically active as well.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of Formate Dehydrogenase for Regeneration of a Non&#8208;Natural Redox Cofactor</title>
      <dc:description>Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) has been widely used for the regeneration of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). To utilize nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) as a non&#8208;natural redox cofactor, it remains challenging as NCDH, the reduced form of NCD, has to be efficiently regenerated. Here we demonstrate successful engineering of FDH for NCDH regeneration. Guided by the structural information of FDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (pseFDH) and the NAD&#8208;pseFDH complex, semi&#8208;rational strategies were applied to design mutant libraries and screen for NCD&#8208;linked activity. The most active mutant reached a cofactor preference switch from NAD to NCD by 3700&#8208;fold. Homology modeling analysis showed that these mutants had reduced cofactor binding pockets and dedicated hydrophobic interactions for NCD. Efficient regeneration of NCDH was implemented by powering an NCD&#8208;dependent D&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase for stoichiometric and stereospecific reduction of pyruvate to D&#8208;lactate at the expense of formate.</dc:description>

This principle can provide a straightforward access to hydrophenalene in an optically active form which represents a structural core of various natural products and bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Structural hybridization of bioactive heterocycles is a promising tool to develop new efficient therapeutics for the treatment of various diseases including viral infections. The merging of two differently acting heterocycles&#8212;artemisinin and isoquinoline&#8212;in one hybrid molecule results in the discovery of a new and potent antiviral agent, which exceeds parent compounds in anti&#8208;HCMV and anti&#8208;HBV activities and is even able to outperform the clinically used drug ganciclovir.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Resorcin[4]arene Cavitands: Toward Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Molecular Grippers</title>
      <dc:description>
Resorcin[4]arene cavitands can be switched between a kite conformation, adopted in the dark, and a vase conformation, generated under visible light irradiation. The switching is triggered by the formation of a semiquinone radical anion through a photosensitizing process. The large conformational rearrangement of the cavitands resembles the mechanical switching occurring in some flowers that bloom open in the evening and close during the day (cover design: Ella Maru Studio).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resorcin[4]arene cavitands&lt;/b&gt; can be switched between a kite conformation, adopted in the dark, and a vase conformation, generated under visible light irradiation. The switching is triggered by the formation of a semiquinone radical anion through a photosensitizing process. The large conformational rearrangement of the cavitands resembles the mechanical switching occurring in some flowers that bloom open in the evening and close during the day (cover design: Ella Maru Studio). More information can be found in the Full Paper by V. Garc&#237;a&#8208;L&#243;pez, F.&#8197;Diederich, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Stabilization of triplet biradical intermediate of 5&#8208;methylcytosine enhances cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation in DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is a photoproduct formed by two stacked pyrimidine bases via a cycloaddition reaction upon irradiation. Due to its close association with skin cancer, the mechanism of CPD formation has been studied thoroughly. Among many aspects of CPD, its formation involving 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) has been of special interest because CPD yield is known to increase by C5&#8208;methylation of cytosine. In this work, we use high level QM/MM calculations to examine a previously experimentally detected pathway for CPD formation in hetero (thymine&#8208;cytosine and thymine&#8208;5mC) dipyrimidines that is facilitated through intersystem crossing in thymine and formation of a triplet biradical intermediate. A DNA duplex model system containing a core sequence TmCG or TCG is used. We demonstrate that the stabilization of a radical center in the biradical intermediate by the methyl group of 5mC can lead to increased CPD yield in TmCG compared to its non&#8208;methylated counterpart, TCG, thereby suggesting the existence of a new pathway of CPD formation enhanced by 5mC.</dc:description>

      <title>Edge Functionalized Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>Nanographenes (NGs) have recently emerged as new carbon materials. Their nanoscale size results in a size&#8208;dependent quantum confinement effect, opening the band gap by a few eV. This energy gap allows NGs to be applied as optical materials. This property has attracted researchers across multiple scientific fields. The photophysical properties of NGs can be manipulated by introducing organic groups onto their basal planes and/or into their edges. In addition, the integration of organic functional groups into NGs results in NG&#8208;based hybrid materials. These features make the postsynthetic modification of NGs an active research area. Since obtainable information on chemically functionalized NGs is limited due to their nonstoichiometry and structural uncertainty, their structural characterization requires a combination of multiple spectroscopic methods. Therefore, information on the characterization procedures of recently published chemically functionalized NGs is of value for advancing the field of NG&#8208;based hybrid materials. The present review focuses on the structural characterization of chemically functionalized NGs. We hope this review will help to advance this field.</dc:description>

      <title>A Streamlined Regenerative Glycosylation Reaction: Direct, Acid&#8208;Free Activation of Thioglycosides</title>
      <dc:description>Our group has previously reported that 3,3&#8208;difluoroxindole (HOFox) is able to mediate glycosylations via intermediacy of OFox imidates. Thioglycoside precursors were first converted into the corresponding glycosyl bromides that were then converted into the OFox imidates in the presence of Ag  2  O followed by the activation with catalytic Lewis acid in a regenerative fashion. Reported herein is a direct conversion of thioglycosides via the regenerative approach that bypasses the intermediacy of bromides and eliminates the need for heavy metal&#8208;based promoters. The direct regenerative activation of thioglycosides is achieved under neural reaction conditions using only 1 equiv NIS and catalytic HOFox without the acidic additives</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our group has previously reported that 3,3&#8208;difluoroxindole (HOFox) is able to mediate glycosylations via intermediacy of OFox imidates. Thioglycoside precursors were first converted into the corresponding glycosyl bromides that were then converted into the OFox imidates in the presence of Ag  2  O followed by the activation with catalytic Lewis acid in a regenerative fashion. Reported herein is a direct conversion of thioglycosides via the regenerative approach that bypasses the intermediacy of bromides and eliminates the need for heavy metal&#8208;based promoters. The direct regenerative activation of thioglycosides is achieved under neural reaction conditions using only 1 equiv NIS and catalytic HOFox without the acidic additives&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Acidic monosaccharides become incorporated into calcite single crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Carbohydrates, along with proteins and peptides, are known to represent a major class of biomacromolecules involved in calcium carbonate biomineralization. However, in spite of multiple physical or biochemical characterizations, the explicit role of saccharide macromolecules (long chains of carbohydrate molecules) is not yet understood in mineral deposition. In the present study we investigated the influence of two common acidic monosaccharides (MSs), which are the simplest form of carbohydrates and are represented here by glucuronic and galacturonic acids, on the formation of calcite crystals  in vitro  . We show that the size, morphology and microstructure of calcite crystals are altered when they are grown in the presence of these MSs. More importantly, MSs were found to become incorporated into the calcite crystalline lattice and induce anisotropic lattice distortions, a widely studied phenomenon in other biomolecules related to CaCO  3  biomineralization but never before reported in the case of single MSs. Changes in the calcite lattice induced by MS incorporation were precisely determined by the technique of high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. We believe that the results of this research may deepen our understanding of the interaction of saccharide polymers with an inorganic host and shed light on the implications of carbohydrates for biomineralization processes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Water&#8208;Gated Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistor for Glyphosate Detection: A Comparative Study with Fluorescence Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>We here propose a design of a highly sensitive solid&#8208;state sensor device based on a water&#8208;gated organic thin&#8208;film transistor (WG&#8208;OTFT) for the selective detection of herbicide glyphosate (GlyP) in water. A competitive assay among carboxylate&#8208;functionalized polythiophene, Cu  2+  , and GlyP was employed as a sensing mechanism. Molecular recognition phenomena and electrical double layer (EDL) (at the polymer/water interface) originated from the field&#8208;effect worked cooperatively to amplify the sensitivity for GlyP. The limit of detection of WG&#8208;OTFT (0.26 ppm) was lower than that of a fluorescence sensor chip (0.95 ppm) which are conventional sensing methods. In contrast to the previously reported insulated molecular wires to block interchain interactions, molecular aggregates under the field&#8208;effect has shown to be effective for amplification of sensitivity through &#8220;intra&#8221;&#8208; and &#8220;inter&#8221;&#8208;molecular wire effects. The opposite strategy in this study would pave the way for fully pulling out the sensing property of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state sensor devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Simple Synthesis of a Heterocyclophane Exhibiting Anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met Activity by Acting as a Hatch Blocking Access to the Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>A simple approach to the synthesis of heterocyclophane consisting of two 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bithiazoles has been developed in mild conditions. The heterocyclophane with two short chains was conveniently prepared by Hantzsch thiazoles synthesis using the reaction of 3&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxycarbonyl&#8208;3&#8208;azapentanethiocarboxamide with 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione in methanol under reflux for only 15 minutes. Amino groups at the linkers of this heterocyclophane can be functionalized to give acylated and carbamate derivatives. Their properties as protein kinase inhibitors were investigated, and one of the heterocyclophanes exhibited specific c&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) anti&#8208;activity (IC  50  = 603 nM) among 7 types of protein kinases investigated. The computational site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method was used to determine why the one heterocyclophane exhibited strong anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Elucidating Atropisomerism in Nonplanar Porphyrins with Tunable Supramolecular Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Atropisomerism is a fundamental feature of substituted biaryls resulting from rotation around the biaryl axis. Different stereoisomers are formed due to restricted rotation about the single bond, a situation often found in substituted porphyrins. Previously NMR determination of porphyrin atropisomers proved difficult, if not almost impossible to accomplish, due to low resolution or unresolvable resonance signals that predominantly overlapped. Here, we shed some light on this fundamental issue found in porphyrinoid stereochemistry. Using benzenesulfonic acid (BSA) for host&#8211;guest interactions and performing 1D, 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses, we were able to characterize all four rotamers of the nonplanar 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18&#8208;octaethylporphyirin as restricted H&#8208;bonding complexes. Additionally, X&#8208;ray structural analysis was used to investigate aspects of the weak host&#8211;guest interactions. A detailed assignment of the chemical signals suggests charge&#8208;assisted complexation as a key to unravel the atropisomeric enigma. From a method development perspective, symmetry operations unique to porphyrin atropisomers offer an essential handle to accurately identify the rotamers using NMR techniques only.</dc:description>

Resorcin[4]arene cavitands, equipped with diverse quinone (Q) and [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) photosensitizing walls in different configurations, were synthesized. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 420&#8197;nm, electron transfer from the [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ to the Q generates the semiquinone (SQ) radical anion, triggering a large conformational switching from a flat kite to a vase with a cavity for the encapsulation of small guests, such as cyclohexane and heteroalicyclic derivatives, in CD3CN. Depending on the molecular design, the SQ radical anion can live for several minutes (&#8776;10&#8197;min) and the vase can be generated in a secondary process without need for addition of a sacrificial electron donor to accumulate the SQ state. Switching can also be triggered by other stimuli, such as changes in solvent, host&#8211;guest complexation, and chemical and electrochemical processes. This comprehensive investigation benefits the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive nanodevices, such as light&#8208;activated molecular grippers.
