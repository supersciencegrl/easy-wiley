         <title>4&#8208;Iodopyrimidine labeling reveals nuclear translocation and nuclease activity for both MIF and MIF2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog MIF2 (also known as D&#8208;dopachrome tautomerase or DDT) play key roles in cell growth and immune responses. MIF and MIF2 expression is dysregulated in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate and convenient detection of MIF and MIF2 will facilitate research on their roles in cancer and other diseases. Herein, we report the development and application of a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe  8  for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. Probe  8  incorporates a fluorophore that allows  in situ  imaging of these two proteins. This enabled visualization of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation of HeLa cells. This observation, combined with literature on nuclease activity for MIF, enabled the identification of nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>New type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for anion recognition. Strong anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions between halides and aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich compounds of benzene, cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and indenyl were studied as a new type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for interactions with halide anions. While uncoordinated benzene forms only C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions, and hexafluorobenzene forms only anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds can form both types of interactions, since their entire electrostatic potential surface is positive. These aromatic ligands can form stronger anion&#8208;&#960; interactions than organic aromatic molecules, as a consequence of more pronounced dispersion and induction energy components. Moreover, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions of aromatic ligands are stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, and significantly stronger than C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions of benzene. Our study shows that transition metal coordination can make aromatic moieties suitable for strong interactions with anions, and gives insight into the design of new anion receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Polyoxometalate Platforms for Supramolecular Light&#8208;driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional supramolecular systems are a central research topic in light&#8208;driven solar energy conversion. Here, we report a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based supramolecular dyad, where two platinum&#8208;complex hydrogen evolution catalysts are covalently anchored to an Anderson polyoxomolybdate anion. Supramolecular electrostatic coupling of the system to an iridium photosensitizer enables visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. Combined theory and experiment demonstrate the multifunctionality of the POM, which acts as photosensitizer / catalyst&#8208;binding&#8208;site and facilitates light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic turnover. Chemical modification of the Pt&#8208;catalyst site leads to increased hydrogen evolution reactivity. Mechanistic studies shed light on the role of the individual components and provide a molecular understanding of the interactions which govern stability and reactivity. The system could serve as a blueprint for multifunctional polyoxometalates in energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Mechanism of CO2 Electroreduction on Non&#8208;noble Metal Single&#8208;atom Catalyst of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the work, a series of non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalyst of Mo  2  CS  2  &#8208;MXene for CO  2  reduction were systematically investigated by well&#8208;defined density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that nine types of transitional metal (TM) supported Mo  2  CS  2  (TM&#8211;Mo  2  CS  2  ) are very stable, while eight of which can effectively inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After comprehensively comparing the changes of free energy for each pathway in CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), it is found that the products of these TM&#8211;Mo  2  CS  2  are not completely CH  4  . Furthermore, Cr&#8211;, Fe&#8211;, Co&#8211; and Ni&#8211;Mo  2  CS  2  are found to render excellent CO  2  RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304 V. In particular, Fe&#8211;Mo  2  CS  2  with a nitrogenase&#8211;like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity.  Ab initio  molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have also proven that these kinds of single&#8211;atom catalysts with robust performance could exist stably at room temperature. Therefore, these single TM atoms anchored on the surface of MXenes can be profiled as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of CoCeSx Bimetallic Sulfide Nanoparticles on a Bi&#8208;Pyrene Terminated Molecular Wire Modified Graphene Surface for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphene sheets were prepared using a bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets, thereby forming nanoscale spaces between sheets. The angle between the BPMW coplanar pyrene group and the phenyl group was 33.2&#176;, and the graphene layer is supported in an oblique direction. Finally, CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid is synthesized and employed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor.







Abstract
The excellent electrical conductivity of graphene is due to its highly&#8208;conjugated structures. Manipulation of the electronic and mechanical properties of graphene can be achieved by controlling the destruction of its in&#8208;sheet conjugation system. Herein, we report the preparation of CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at the molecular level. In this study, sodium alginate was reacted with Co2+ and Ce3+, and the composite was loaded onto a graphene surface. The graphene sheets were prepared using a bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets, thereby forming nanoscale spaces between sheets. The angle between the BPMW coplanar pyrene group and the phenyl group was 33.2&#176;, and the graphene layer is supported in an oblique direction. Finally, a three&#8208;dimensional porous composite was obtained after annealing and vulcanization. The obtained CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO exhibited excellent electrical conductivity and remarkable cycle stability. When the current density was 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, its specific capacitance was as high as 1004&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1. BPMW modifies graphene through the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction and special structure to obtain excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, a solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated based on the synthesized CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid, which exhibited a power density of 979&#8197;W&#8197;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 23.96&#8197;Wh&#8197;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotic barriers? Calcium carbonate chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled mineral membranes that form upon contact of a solid calcium salt with an alkaline carbonate&#8208;rich solution. In&#8208;situ studies on solution speciation and ex&#8208;situ membrane characterization show that the tube walls are highly crystalline materials with complex texture that impede ion exchange and prevent transmembrane electrochemical potentials from being generated. These findings have important implications for the relevance of such structures as microreactors for chemical conversions and as catalysts in prebiotic chemistry.







Abstract
Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled tubular precipitates formed by a combination of osmosis, buoyancy, and chemical reaction, and thought to be capable of catalyzing prebiotic condensation reactions. In many cases, the tube wall is a bilayer structure with the properties of a diaphragm and/or a membrane. The interest in silica gardens as microreactors for materials science has increased over the past decade because of their ability to create long&#8208;lasting electrochemical potential. In this study, we have grown single macroscopic tubes based on calcium carbonate and monitored their time&#8208;dependent behavior by in&#8197;situ measurements of pH, ionic concentrations inside and outside the tubular membranes, and electrochemical potential differences. Furthermore, we have characterized the composition and structure of the tubular membranes by using ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Based on the collected data, we propose a physicochemical mechanism for the formation and ripening of these peculiar CaCO3 structures and compare the results to those of other chemical garden systems. We find that the wall of the macroscopic calcium carbonate tubes is a bilayer of texturally distinct but compositionally similar calcite showing high crystallinity. The resulting high density of the material prevents macroscopic calcium carbonate gardens from developing significant electrochemical potential differences. In the light of these observations, possible implications in materials science and prebiotic (geo)chemistry are discussed.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc Oligosaccharides Using an Endo&#8208;Glycosynthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic cascade synthesis of long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc oligosaccharides perfectly controlled in size is reported. A hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme glycosynthase was developed to catalyze the glycosylation of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Using this glycosynthase in concert with a chitin&#8208;oligosaccharide N&#8208;deacetylase allowed controlled glycosylation of the fluoride onto oligosaccharide acceptors without competing polycondensation reaction. This enzymatic cascade enabled the preparation of the important plant elicitors chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with very good yields.







Abstract
Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in Pichia pastoris at 52&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective N&#8208;deacetylation at the non&#8208;reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by Sinorhizobium meliloti NodB chitin&#8208;N&#8208;deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis on a milligram scale of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65&#8201;% and a perfect control over their size.

         <title>Fast and Efficient Postsynthetic DNA Labeling in Cells by Means of Strain&#8208;Promoted Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloadditions</title>

Fast and efficient: DNA strands, modified with the novel bioorthogonal reporters sydnones, undergo fast and efficient labeling with cyclooctynes and have the potential to become essential tools for imaging DNA and possibly RNA in cells.







Abstract
Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3&#8208;dipoles that react with cyclooctynes through strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). Although sydnones have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids have not yet been tagged by SPSAC. Evaluation of SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.59&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single&#8208;stranded DNAs, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.

         <title>Metal Centers as Nucleophiles: Oxymoron of Halogen Bond&#8208;Involving Crystal Engineering</title>

Metal centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for halogen bonding, and behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction.







Abstract
This review highlights recent studies discovering unconventional halogen bonding (HaB) that involves positively charged metal centers. These centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for HaB, and thus behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction. This role of some electron&#8208;rich transition metal centers can be considered an oxymoron in the sense that the metal is, in most cases, formally cationic; consequently, its electron donor function is unexpected. The importance of Ha&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d&#8208;[M] (Ha=halogen; M is Group 9 (Rh, Ir), 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt), or 11 (Cu, Au)) interactions in crystal engineering is emphasized by showing remarkable examples (reported and uncovered by our processing of the Cambridge Structural Database), where this Ha&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d&#8208;[M] directional interaction guides the formation of solid supramolecular assemblies of different dimensionalities.

A NIR photosensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br was designed and synthesized based on a cyanine derivate (Cy5.5&#8208;H), which presented extraordinary super heavy atom effect (SHAE) and structure&#8208;inherent targeting (SIT) to tumors. Moreover, Cy5.5&#8208;Br has a satisfactory triplet quantum yield, an unusual long&#8208;lived triplet state and excellent photostability upon hot&#8208;band excitation, which makes it possible to realize effective PDT under a biosafety optical density.







Abstract
Upconversion luminescent (UCL) triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) affords superior outcome for cancer treatment. However, conventional UCL materials which all work by a multiphoton absorption (MPA) process inevitably need extremely high power density far over the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to laser. Here, a one&#8208;photon absorption molecular upconversion sensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br based on frequency upconversion luminescent (FUCL) is designed for PDT. The unusual super heavy atom effect (SHAE) in Cy5.5&#8208;Br strongly enhances its spin&#8208;orbit coupling (0.23&#8197;cm&#8722;1), triplet quantum yield (11.1&#8201;%) and triplet state lifetime (18.8&#8197;&#956;s) while the potential hot&#8208;band absorption of Cy5.5&#8208;Br is well maintained. Importantly, Cy5.5&#8208;Br can efficiently target the tumour site and kill cancer cells by destroying mitochondria under a biosafety MPE to 808&#8197;nm laser. The photostability and antitumor results are obviously superior to that of a Stokes process. This work provides a design criterion for FUCL dyes to realize effective PDT upon a biosafety optical density, possibly bringing more clinical benefits than conventional MPA materials.

         <title>Tunable Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties from Room Temperature Phosphorescent Cyclic Triimidazole&#8208;Pyrene Bio&#8208;Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TT&#8208;Pyr bioprobe crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvates. Starting from solvate structures, thermal transformation to room temperature and, finally, high temperature polymorphs is accompanied by variation in the phopotophysical behavior which has been interpreted through theoretical and structural analyses. Dual fluorescence, RTP and SHG signal are observed for the non&#8208;centrosymmetric TT&#8208;Pyr(HT) polymorph.







Abstract
Organic materials with multiple emissions tunable by external stimuli represent a great challenge. TTPyr, crystallizing in different polymorphs, shows a very rich photophyisics comprising excitation&#8208;dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence at ambient conditions, and mechanochromic and thermochromic behavior. Transformation among the different species has been followed by thermal and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and the emissive features interpreted through structural results and DFT/TDDFT calculations. Particularly intriguing is the polymorph TTPyr(HT), serendipitously obtained at high temperature but stable also at room temperature, whose non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure guarantees an SHG efficiency 10 times higher than that of standard urea. Its crystal packing, where only the TT units are strongly rigidified by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions while the Pyr moieties possess partial conformational freedom, is responsible for the observed dual fluorescence. The potentialities of TTPyr for bioimaging have been successfully established.

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reliable Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetry in the electron distribution of positional isomers of quinoxaline derivatives results in distinguishable acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive emissions; this can function as the basis for enabling the construction of multichannel encryption devices. The reliability of encryption is improved by the minimized compositional difference and responsive mechanism on the molecular level.







Abstract
Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence colors in an acidic environment; this allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Because the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.

         <title>Fluorination Reactions at a Platinum Carbene Complex: Reaction Routes to SF3, S(=O)F and Fluorido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studies on the reactivity of thionyl fluoride and sulfur tetrafluoride towards the Pt(0) complex [Pt(IMes)2] led to the generation of Pt(II) SF3 and SOF complexes. The activation of SF6 at [Pt(IMes)2] gave a variety of fluorido complexes, some of which were synthesized independently by fluorination with HF or XeF2.







Abstract
The electron&#8208;rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)2] (IMes: [1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds. The sulfur fluoride SF4 undergoes a rapid oxidative addition at Pt0 to yield trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SF3)(IMes)2]. A photolytic reaction of SF6 at [Pt(IMes)2] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SF3)(IMes)2] along with trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)] (IMes&#8217;: cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water. trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(IMes)2] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)2] with SOF2 or XeF2. A reaction of [Pt(IMes)2] with a HF source gave trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)2], and an intermediate bifluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(FHF)(IMes)2] was identified. Compound trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)2] converts in the presence of CsF into trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)].

A photolytic reaction of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at [Pt(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(F)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(F)(SF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] along with &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)] (IMes&#8217;: cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water. &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(F)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] with SOF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A reaction of [Pt(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] with a HF source gave &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], and an intermediate bifluorido complex &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(H)(FHF)(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] was identified. Compound &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] converts in the presence of CsF into &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Easy Production of &#8220;Difficult Peptides&#8221; Using Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis and a New Methionine Analogue as a Latent Peptide Cleavage Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difficult peptides as well as unnatural analogues were produced by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis, applying a fusion protein strategy. A new heat&#8208;labile analogue of methionine was utilized in combination with a stable carrier to release the peptide only. No toxic chemicals, neither protected amino acids nor special equipment is required, thus disclosing a considerable alternative to solid phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Aliphatic &#947;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporated in place of their canonical analogues through cell&#8208;free protein synthesis act as heat&#8208;labile linkers, offering a useful strategy for the straightforward production of target peptides as fusion proteins, from which the targets are readily released. Until now, the natural abundance of aliphatic amino acids in peptides has limited the scope of the method, as it leads to undesired cleavage sites in synthesized products, but here the authors report the development of a new cleavable chloro amino acid that incorporates in place of the relatively rare amino acid methionine, thus greatly expanding the scope of producible targets. This new strategy is employed for simplified peptide synthesis with a methionine&#8208;free fusion partner, allowing single&#8208;site incorporation of the cleavable linker for clean release and easy purification of the target peptide. Its utility is demonstrated through the straightforward preparation of two peptides reported to be challenging targets and not accessible through standard solid&#8208;phase chemical methodologies, as well as analogues.

Exploiting structural metamorphosis to wrap microspheres: The &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film is described. This approach utilizes dynamic covalent polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly crosslinked to intermolecularly crosslinked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur.







Abstract
There is growing interest in developing methods to &#8216;wrap&#8217; nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects within films that may offer protection, enhance their stability or improve performance. We describe the successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film. This approach utilizes polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly cross&#8208;linked to intermolecularly cross&#8208;linked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur. This work is significant as it suggests that nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects such as virus&#8208;like particles, bacteria or mammalian cells&#8212;all of which may benefit from additional environmental protection or stabilization in emerging applications&#8212;may also be &#8216;wrapped&#8217; by this approach.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Amines via Mild and Selective sp3 C&#8722;H Imination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One for all: We report the sp3 C&#8722;H imination of simple alkanes and functionalized molecules, which provides primary amines on workup. Our method shows good site selectivity and functional group tolerance, which we have used for the synthesis of complex amines. We characterize a unique mechanism involving radical rebound to imine.







Abstract
The direct replacement of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds with simple amine units (&#8722;NH2) remains synthetically challenging, although primary aliphatic amines are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. We report a mild and selective protocol for preparing primary and secondary aliphatic amines in a single pot, based on intermolecular sp3 C&#8722;H imination. The first C&#8722;H imination of diverse alkanes, this method shows useful site&#8208;selectivity within substrates bearing multiple sp3 C&#8722;H bonds. Furthermore, this reaction tolerates polar functional groups relevant for complex molecule synthesis, highlighted in the synthesis of amine pharmaceuticals and amination of natural products. We characterize a unique C&#8722;H imination mechanism based on radical rebound to an iminyl radical, supported by kinetic isotope effects, stereoablation, resubmission, and computational modeling. This work constitutes a selective method for complex amine synthesis and a new mechanistic platform for C&#8722;H amination.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Associations of Amphiphilic Dendrons and Their Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrons are molecular trees, constituted of a tail (a trunk) to which several branches are attached. The different types of self&#8208;associations of amphiphilic dendrons at the air&#8208;water interface, as micelles or as vesicles is described. The properties of these associations of dendrons (direct or reverse micelles or vesicles) in particular as carriers of drugs or of DNA or siRNA, or as drugs by themselves is also discussed.







Abstract
This review presents precisely defined amphiphilic dendrons, their self&#8208;association properties, and their different uses. Dendrons, also named dendritic wedges, are composed of a core having two different types of functions, of which one type is used for growing or grafting branched arms, generally multiplied by 2 at each layer by using 1&#8594;2 branching motifs. A large diversity of structures has been already synthesized. In practically all cases, their synthesis is based on the synthesis of known dendrimers, such as poly(aryl ether), poly(amidoamine) (in particular PAMAM), poly(amide) (in particular poly(L&#8208;lysine)), 1&#8594;3 branching motifs (instead of 1&#8594;2), poly(alkyl ether) (poly(glycerol) and poly(ethylene glycol)), poly(ester), and those containing main group elements (poly(carbosilane) and poly(phosphorhydrazone)). In most cases, the hydrophilic functions are on the surface of the dendrons, whereas one or two hydrophobic tails are linked to the core. Depending on the structure of the dendrons, and on the experimental conditions used, the amphiphilic dendrons can self&#8208;associate at the air&#8208;water interface, or form micelles (eventually tubular, but most generally spherical), or form vesicles. These associated dendrons are suitable for the encapsulation of low&#8208;molecular or macromolecular bioactive entities to be delivered in cells. This review is organized depending on the nature of the internal structure of the amphiphilic dendrons (aryl ether, amidoamine, amide, quaternary carbon atom, alkyl ether, ester, main group element). The properties issued from their self&#8208;associations are described all along the review.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Glucocerebrosidase Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tagged cyclophellitols offer a powerful activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) approach to the study of glycosidase activities. Here, a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs were synthesised and investigated on the 3D structure of human &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA), demonstrating their mechanism&#8208;based mode of action. We envisage these inactivators will serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to Gaucher Disease.







Abstract
Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited deficiencies in &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Current treatments require rapid disease diagnosis and a means of monitoring therapeutic efficacy, both of which may be supported by the use of GBA&#8208;targeting activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). Here, we report the synthesis and structural analysis of a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs for GBA. We demonstrate their covalent mechanism&#8208;based mode of action and uncover binding of the new N&#8208;functionalised aziridines to the ligand binding cleft. These inhibitors became scaffolds for the development of ABPs; the O6&#8208;fluorescent tags of which bind in an allosteric site at the dimer interface. Considering GBA's preference for O6&#8208; and N&#8208;functionalised reagents, a bi&#8208;functional aziridine ABP was synthesized as a potentially more powerful imaging agent. Whilst this ABP binds to two unique active site clefts of GBA, no further benefit in potency was achieved over our first generation ABPs. Nevertheless, such ABPs should serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to GD and inform the design of future probes.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radical Borylation of Alkyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical and direct method was developed for the production of versatile alkylboronic esters via transition metal&#8208;free borylation of primary and secondary alkyl sulfones. The key to the success of the strategy is the use of bis(neopentyl glycolato) diboron (B 2 neop 2 ), with a stoichiometric amount of base as a promoter. The practicality and industrial potential of this protocol are highlighted by its wide functional group tolerance, the late&#8208;stage modification of complex compounds, no need for further transesterification, and operational simplicity. Radical clock, radical trap experiments, and EPR studies were conducted which show that the borylation process involves radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Case Study of N&#8208;iPr vs. N&#8208;Mes substituted NHC Ligands in Nickel Chemistry: The Coordination and Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes at [Ni(NHC)2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A case study on the effect of the employment of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC =iPr2ImMe&#160;1Me, Mes2Im 2) and their behavior towards alkynes is reported. The reaction of a mixture of [Ni2(iPr2ImMe)4(&#181;&#8208;(&#951;2:&#951;2)&#8208;COD)] B/ [Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(&#951;4&#8208;COD)] B&#8217; or [Ni(Mes2Im)2] 2, respectively, with alkynes afforded complexes [Ni(NHC)2(&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)] 3&#8208;18). Unusual rearrangement products 11a and 12a were identified for the complexes of the terminal alkynes HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) and HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4), 11 and 12, which were formed via addition of a C&#8211;H bond of one of the NHC N&#8208;iPr methyl groups to the C&#8801;C triple bond of the coordinated alkyne. Complex 2 catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of 2&#8208;butyne, 4&#8208;octyne, diphenylacetylene, dimethyl acetylendicarboxylate, 1&#8208;pentyne, phenylacetylene and methyl propiolate at ambient conditions, whereas 1Me is not a good catalyst. The reaction of 2 with 2&#8208;butyne was monitored in some detail which led to a mechanistic proposal for the cyclotrimerization at [Ni(NHC)2]. DFT calculations reveal that the differences between 1Me and 2 for alkyne cyclotrimerization lie in the energy profile of the initiation steps, which is very shallow for 2, and each step is associated with only a moderate energy change. The higher stability of 3 compared to 14 is attributed to a better electron transfer from the NHC to the metal to the alkyne ligand for the N&#8208;alkyl substituted NHC, to enhanced Ni&#8208;alkyne backbonding due to a smaller CNHC&#8211;Ni&#8211;CNHC bite angle, and to less steric repulsion of the smaller NHC  iPr2ImMe.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Masked trimethyl lock (TML) systems as molecular moieties enabling the bioresponsive release of compounds or dyes in a controlled temporal and spatial manner have been widely applied for the development of drug conjugates, prodrugs or molecular imaging tools. Here, we report the development of a novel amino trimethyl lock (H  2  N&#8208;TML) system as an auto&#8208;immolative molecular entity for the release of fluorophores. We designed  Cou&#8208;TML&#8208;N  3  and  MURh&#8208;TML&#8208;N  3  , two azide&#8208;masked turn&#8208;on fluorophores. The latter was demonstrated to selectively release fluorescent  MURh  in presence of physiological concentrations of the redox&#8208;signaling molecule H  2  S  in vitro  and was successfully applied to image H  2  S in human cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of electricity over traditional stoichiometric oxidants is a promising strategy for sustainable molecular assembly. Herein, we describe the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8211;H activation/alkylation of several N&#8208;heteroarenes. This catalytic approach has been successfully applied to several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids. The versatile C&#8211;H alkylation featured water as a co&#8208;solvent and user&#8208;friendly trifluoroborates as alkylating agents. Finally, the rhodaelectrocatalysis with unsaturated organotrifluoroborates proceeded by paired electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallodrug Profiling against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Target Proteins Identifies Highly Potent Inhibitors of the Spike/ACE2 interaction and the Papain&#8208;like Protease PLpro</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has called for an urgent need for dedicated antiviral therapeutics. Metal complexes are commonly underrepresented in the compound libraries that are used for screening in drug discovery campaigns, however, there is growing evidence for their role in medicinal chemistry. Based on previous results, we have selected more than 100 structurally diverse metal complexes for a profiling as inhibitors of two relevant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication mechanisms, namely the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and the papain&#8208;like protease PL  pro  . In addition to many well&#8208;established types of mononuclear experimental metallodrugs, the pool of compounds tested was extended to approved metal&#8208;based therapeutics such as silver sulfadiazine and thiomersal, as well as polyoxometalates (POMs). Among the mononuclear metal complexes, only a small number of active inhibitors of the spike/ACE2 interaction was identified, with titanocene dichloride as the only strong inhibitor. However, among the gold and silver containing complexes many turned out to be very potent inhibitors of PL  pro  activity. Highly promising activity against both targets was noted for many POMs. Selected complexes were evaluated in antiviral SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 assays confirming activity for gold complexes with  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or dithiocarbamato ligands, a silver NHC complex, titanocene dichloride as well as a POM. These studies might provide starting points for the design of metal&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antiviral agents.</dc:description>

In addition to many well-established types of mononuclear experimental metallodrugs, the pool of compounds tested was extended to approved metal-based therapeutics such as silver sulfadiazine and thiomersal, as well as polyoxometalates (POMs). Among the mononuclear metal complexes, only a small number of active inhibitors of the spike/ACE2 interaction was identified, with titanocene dichloride as the only strong inhibitor. However, among the gold and silver containing complexes many turned out to be very potent inhibitors of PL  pro  activity. Highly promising activity against both targets was noted for many POMs. Selected complexes were evaluated in antiviral SARS-CoV-2 assays confirming activity for gold complexes with  N  -heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or dithiocarbamato ligands, a silver NHC complex, titanocene dichloride as well as a POM. These studies might provide starting points for the design of metal-based SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of an Enzyme&#8208;Inhibitor Reaction Using Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II for One&#8208;Pot Megamolecule Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents an enzyme building block for the assembly of megamolecules. The system is based on the inhibition of the human&#8208;derived cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) domain. We synthesized a synthetic retinoid bearing an arylfluorosulfate group, which uses sulfur fluoride exchange click chemistry to covalently inhibit CRABP2. We conjugated both the inhibitor and a fluorescein tag to an oligo(ethylene glycol) backbone and measured a second&#8208;order rate constant for the protein inhibition reaction of approximately 3,600 M  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  . We used this new enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair to assemble multi&#8208;protein structures in one&#8208;pot reactions using three orthogonal assembly chemistries to demonstrate exact control over the placement of protein domains within a single, homogeneous molecule. This work enables a new dimension of control over specificity, orientation, and stoichiometry of protein domains within atomically precise nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first application of dinuclear zinc catalyst in dearomatization reaction has been developed. Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization [3+2] annulations of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans or 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes with CF  3  &#8208;containing  N  &#8208;unprotected isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides catalyzed by dinuclear zinc catalyst are realized with excellent diastereomer ratios (dr) of &gt;20:1 and enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 99%, respectively. This protocol provides a practical, straightforward access to structurally diverse pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles containing a 2,3&#8208;fused&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (or dihydrobenzothiphene) moiety, and four contiguous stereocenters. This protocol can be performed on a gram scale. The absolute configuration of products is confirmed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis, and a possible mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

Abstract
The modular synthesis of Au(I)/Ru(II) decorated mono&#8208; and heterobimetallic complexes with &#960;&#8208;conjugated [2.2]paracyclophane is described. [2.2]Paracyclophane serves as a rigid spacer which holds the metal centers in precise spatial orientations and allows metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal distance modulation. A broad set of architectural arrangements of pseudo &#8208;geminal, &#8208;ortho, &#8208;meta, and &#8208;para substitution patterns were employed. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal distance modulation of Au(I)/Ru(II) heterobimetallic complexes and the innate transannular &#960;&#8208;communication of the cyclophanyl scaffold provides a promising platform for the investigations of structure&#8208;activity relationship and cooperative effects. The Au(I)/Ru(II) heterobimetallic cyclophanyl complexes are stable, easily accessible, and exhibit promising catalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light promoted arylative Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement.

         <title>Control of Protonated Schiff Base Excited State Decay within Visual Protein Mimics: A Unified Model for Retinal Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A joint experimental&#8208;computational study elucidates the photophysics of retinal Schiff bases embedded in artificial proteins capable of mimicking the color tunability of natural visual pigments as compared to solvated chromophores. Combining ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations allowed monitoring nonlinear optical signals of the chromophore, shedding light on the complexity beyond the fine control of its excited state lifetime.







Abstract
Artificial biomimetic chromophore&#8208;protein complexes inspired by natural visual pigments can feature color tunability across the full visible spectrum. However, control of excited state dynamics of the retinal chromophore, which is of paramount importance for technological applications, is lacking due to its complex and subtle photophysics/photochemistry. Here, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations are combined for the study of highly tunable rhodopsin mimics, as compared to retinal chromophores in solution. Conical intersections and transient fluorescent intermediates are identified with atomistic resolution, providing unambiguous assignment of their ultrafast excited state absorption features. The results point out that the electrostatic environment of the chromophore, modified by protein point mutations, affects its excited state properties allowing control of its photophysics with same power of chemical modifications of the chromophore. The complex nature of such fine control is a fundamental knowledge for the design of bio&#8208;mimetic opto&#8208;electronic and photonic devices.

Conical intersections and transient fluorescent intermediates are identified with atomistic resolution, providing unambiguous assignment of their ultrafast excited state absorption features. The results point out that the electrostatic environment of the chromophore, modified by protein point mutations, affects its excited state properties allowing control of its photophysics with same power of chemical modifications of the chromophore. The complex nature of such fine control is a fundamental knowledge for the design of bio-mimetic opto-electronic and photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Singlet Biradical Versus Triplet Biradical/Zwitterion Characteristics in Isomers of C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C7&#8722;C6&#8208;Fused Pentacyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Revealed through Reactivity Patterns</title>

         <dc:description>
Two isomers of C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C7&#8722;C6 fused pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are imbedded with para&#8208; and meta&#8208;quinondimethane structural motifs respectively. The two compounds exhibit distinctive reactivity patterns reminiscence of singlet and triplet biradical species. The ground state electronic structures predicted by DFT calculation are also consistent with the observed reactivities.







Abstract
Among various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C7&#8722;C6 fused pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have the unique potential to adopt quinonoid, zwitterion, singlet, or triplet biradical electronic configurations. Two such hybrid structures between pentacene and azulene were synthesized and their ground state electronic configurations were deduced from the reactivity patterns they exhibit respectively. Compound 6, where the radicaloid carbons are linked through a para&#8208;phenylene, forms a head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimer like a singlet biradical. In contrast, isomer 7, where the para&#8208;linkage was switched to meta, reacts readily with oxygen which resembles the reactivity of a triplet state. The oxidized intermediate(s) then undergoes rearrangement to furnish the C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C6&#8722;C6 ring contraction product 13. Cation 14, the protonated form of 7, was synthesized, which implies 7 also reacts like a zwitterion. It was revealed the oxidative rearrangement takes place even with mesityl dibenzotropylium cation despite its perceived aromaticity. DFT calculations confirm the most stable forms of 6 and 7 are singlet and triplet diradical, which is consistent with the observed reactivity of respective molecules.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;phase oxidation of cyclohexene was studied over a series of Sr&#8208;substituted La1&#8722;xSrxCoO3 catalysts of perovskite structure under mild reaction conditions with O2 as oxidant in an autoclave. The substitution of Sr into the perovskite structure led to the formation of catalytically active oxygen species. In&#8208;situ ATR IR measurements provided a comprehensive insight into the reaction mechanism under oxidation reaction conditions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Wiggers, B. Peng et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103381).

Origami is a traditional paper&#8208;folding art that enables different structures, such as zabuton (cushion) and shuriken (concealed throwing star), to be constructed from unit papers. In this study, the choice of catalysts controlled the switching of nucleophilic sites of hydrazones, affording different propargylic substitution products like the origami art.

         <title>The Role of Common Alcoholic Sacrificial Agents in Photocatalysis: Is It Always Trivial?</title>

         <dc:description>
HER photocatalysis: Choosing the right sacrificial agent! The cover art features the alcoholic hole&#8208;scavenger requirements for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The desired sacrificial agent forms a relatively strong reducing radical and has an oxidized form that is not a good electron acceptor, which might suppress the HER process. Methanol, fulfilling these requirements, is an excellent choice. Moreover, CH2(OH)2 is the most efficient sacrificial agent in a nontrivial mechanism in acidic media. Our work aims to deepen understanding of the reaction mechanism and guidelines for selecting the best sacrificial agent. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Bar&#8208;Ziv, T. Zidki, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103040).

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As potential analytical tools for collecting and mapping mechanical information in polymer materials, optical force probes (OFPs) have been developed over the last decade. However, due to the diverse properties of polymers, it is necessary to devise tailored OFP solutions for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. In their Minireview (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102938), R. G&#246;stl et&#8197;al. highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Photoreductive Cross Coupling of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives for Ketone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple visible light photochemical, nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acid&#8208;derived precursors is presented. Hantzsch&#8208;ester (HE) functions as a cheap, green and strong photoreductant to facilitate radical generation and also engages in the Ni&#8208;catalytic cycle to restore the reactive species. With this dual role, HE allows for the coupling of a large variety of radicals (1&#176;,2&#176;, benzylic, &#945;&#8208;oxy &amp; &#945;&#8208;amino) with aroyl and alkanoyl moieties, a new feature in reactions of this type. With both precursors deriving from abundant carboxylic acids, this protocol is a welcome addition to the organic chemistry toolbox. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions without the need for toxic metal reagents or bases and shows a wide scope, including pharmaceuticals and complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime complex salts: synthesis, patterning on carbon nanomembranes and heterogeneous hydrogen evolution studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobaloximes are promising, earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction. Typically, these cobalt(III) complexes are prepared in situ or employed in their neutral form, e.g. [Co(dmgH  2  )(py)Cl], even though related complex salts have been reported previously and could in principle offer improved catalytic activity as well as more efficient immobilization on solid support. Here we report an interdisciplinary investigation into complex salts [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)  2  ]  +  [Co(dmgBPh  2  )  2  Cl  2  ]  &#8208;  , TBA  +  [Co(dmgBPh  2  )  2  Cl  2  ]  &#8208;  &#160;and [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)  2  ]  +  BArF  &#8208;  . We describe their strategic syntheses from commercially available complex [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)Cl] and demonstrate that these double and single complex salts are potent catalysts for the light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction. We also show that scanning electrochemical cell microscopy can be used to deposit arrays of catalysts [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)  2  ]  +  [Co(dmgBPh  2  )  2  Cl  2  ]  &#8208;&#160;  and&#160; [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)Cl] &#160; on supported and free&#8208;standing amino&#8208;terminated&#160; ~ 1 nm thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs). Photocatalytic H  2&#160;  evolution at such arrays was quantified with Pd microsensors using scanning electrochemical microscopy, thus providing a new approach for catalytic evaluation and opening up novel routes for the creation and analysis of &#8220;designer catalyst arrays&#8221;, nano&#8208;printed in a desired pattern on a solid support.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Off&#8208;target toxicity and insufficient hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) generation limit the further clinical application of nanozymes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we designed and constructed a microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozyme cascade platform for enhanced tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. The nanozyme&#8208;based cascade reaction could be triggered successfully by the high expression of microRNA in cancer cells to generate more &#183;OH, thus exhibiting excellent tumor&#8208;specific therapeutic performance. Our work provides a new dimension for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Benzoisoselenazolones via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Annulative Selenation Using Elemental Selenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoselenazolone derivatives have attracted significant research interest because of their potent therapeutic activities and indispensable applications in organic synthesis. Efficient construction of functionalized isoselenazolone scaffolds is still challenging, and thus new synthetic approaches with improved operational simplicity have been of particular interest. In this manuscript, we introduce a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation using stable and tractable elemental selenium. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions, and the obtained isoselenazolones could be pivotal synthetic precursors for several organoselenium compounds. Based on the designed control experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we propose an unprecedented selenation mechanism involving a highly electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor. The reaction mechanism was further verified by a computational study.</dc:description>

         <title>Bilayer rGO&#8208;Based Photothermal Evaporator for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification[]**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer rGO&#8208;based photothermal evaporator composed of rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) scaffold layer and rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer was fabricated for efficient solar&#8208;driven water purification. The independent evaporator with oriented hydrophilic microchannels integrates water transport, photothermal conversion, photocatalysis, and adsorption, thus achieving high water evaporation rate (1.63&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1) and excellent VOC removal efficiency (96&#8201;%).







Abstract
Interfacial evaporation has emerged as a promising approach to produce freshwater. However, an urgent concern is that, due to the illegal discharge of industrial wastewater, most water bodies are polluted by trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are easily volatilized and enriched in the collected water during the interfacial evaporation process. Herein, a bilayer photothermal evaporator was reasonably designed for contaminated water purification. The bottom hydrophilic rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) sheets purposefully disintegrate water transport channels, thus quickly removing VOCs through physical adsorption. The rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer sufficiently absorbs incident light and therefore persistently generates reactive oxidizing species to degrade upward VOCs. Notably, the oriented microchannels inside the evaporator allow sustained light reflections to improve the utilization of solar energy. The evaporation rate can reach 1.63&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1 with a considerably high VOC removal efficiency of up to 96&#8201;%. Such an integrated bilayer evaporator provides an effective strategy to obtain clean water via solar distillation.

Hyper coordination: The decoration of V&#8208;shaped CE22&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped CE32&#8722; dianions, with alkali counterions, results in 38 new global minima with formula MmCE2p and MnCE3q (E=S&#8722;Te; M=Li&#8722;Cs; n=1, 2; m=2, 3; p=m&#8208;2; q=n&#8208;2) containing a planar hypercoordinate carbon atom &#8722;24 with a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) and 14 with a planar pentacoordinate carbon (ppC).







Abstract
After exploring the potential energy surfaces of MmCE2p (E=S&#8722;Te, M=Li&#8722;Cs, m=2, 3 and p=m&#8208;2) and MnCE3q (E=S&#8722;Te, M=Li&#8722;Cs, n=1, 2, q=n&#8208;2) combinations, we introduce 38 new global minima containing a planar hypercoordinate carbon atom (24 with a planar tetracoordinate carbon and 14 with a planar pentacoordinate carbon). These exotic clusters result from the decoration of V&#8208;shaped CE22&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped CE32&#8722; dianions, respectively, with alkali counterions. All these 38 systems fulfill the geometrical and electronic criteria to be considered as true planar hypercoordinate carbon systems. Chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to chalcogens and ionically connected to alkali metals.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Systems on the Surface of Functionalized Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) Utilizing Hamilton Receptors and Cyanurate Derivative Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental insight of supramolecular interactions on the surface of modified superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) utilizing host&#8208;guest chemistry among Hamilton receptors and cyanurate derivatives. Binding constants of host&#8208;guest systems on the surface of nanoparticles showed stronger binding constant and higher binding ratio compared to free molecules in the solutions, due to synergistic effect on complex surface environment.







Abstract
The study of hydrogen bonding interactions at the level of functionalized nanoparticles remains highly challenging and poorly explored area. In this work, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were orthogonally functionalized using receptors bearing multiple hydrogen bonding motifs. Pristine SPIONs were modified by wet chemical processes with Hamilton receptors (hosts), or cyanurate&#8208;guest molecules linked to phosphonic acid moieties for monolayer functionalization. The modified surfaces were fully characterized and the number of attached ligands on the surface were determined. The host&#8208;guest interactions on the interface of modified SPIONs were investigated by using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titrations. Functionalized SPIONs demonstrated two to three magnitudes stronger binding affinities as compared to the related molecular interactions in solution due to synergistic effects on complex surface environment. Higher supramolecular binding ratios of host&#8208;guest interactions on the modified surface were emerged. These studies provide fundamental insights into supramolecular complexations on the surface at solid&#8208;liquid interface systems with applications in engineered nanomaterials, nano&#8208;sensing devices, and drug delivery systems.

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Supported Gallium Complexes for the Catalytic Hydroboration of Aldehydes, Ketones and Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two novel gallium hydride complexes supported by an N,N&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)amine pincer ligand is described and their activity as catalysts for the catalytic reduction of aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide is explored.







Abstract
Gallium hydrides stabilised by primary and secondary amines are scarce due to their propensity to eliminate dihydrogen. Consequently, their reactivity has received limited attention. The synthesis of two novel gallium hydride complexes HGa(THF)[ON(H)O] and H2Ga[&#956;2&#8208;ON(H)O]Ga[ON(H)O] ([ON(H)O]2&#8722;=N,N&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)amine) is described and their reactivity towards aldehydes and ketones is explored. These reactions afford alkoxide&#8208;bridged dimers through 1,2&#8208;hydrogallation reactions. The gallium hydrides can be regenerated through Ga&#8722;O/B&#8722;H metathesis from the reaction of such dimers with pinacol borane (HBpin) or 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN). These observations allowed us to target the catalytic reduction of carbonyl substrates (aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide) with low catalyst loadings at room temperature.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Co and Fe on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear sweep voltammetry shows a substantial decrease in the oxygen evolution reactions overpotential by Co incorporation in LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3. Spin densities obtained from DFT+U calculations reveal not only the involvement of the Fe and Co reaction sites but also of neighboring sites.







Abstract
In a combined experimental and theoretical study we assess the role of Co incorporation on the OER activity of LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3. Phase pure perovskites were synthesized up to 
 in 0.025/0.050 steps. HAADF STEM and EDX analysis points towards FeO2&#8208;terminated (001)&#8208;facets in LaFeO3, in accordance with the stability diagram obtained from density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard U term (DFT+U). Linear sweep voltammetry conducted in a rotating disk electrode setup shows a reduction of the OER overpotential and a nonmonotonic trend with x, with double layer capacitance measurements indicating an intrinsic nature of activity. This is supported by DFT+U results that show reduced overpotentials for both Fe and Co reaction sites with the latter reaching values of 0.32&#8211;0.40&#8197;V, &#8764;0.3&#8197;V lower than for Fe. This correlates with a stronger reduction of the binding energy difference of the *O and *OH intermediates towards an optimum value of 1.6&#8197;eV for 
, the OH deprotonation being the potential limiting step in most cases. Significant variations of the magnetic moments of both surface and subsurface Co and Fe during OER demonstrate that the beneficial effect is a result of a concerted action involving many surrounding ions, which extends the concept of the active site.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidation of Olefins to Ketones**

How does it work? Herein, we describe our detailed mechanistic studies on the iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of olefins to ketones. Isotopic labeling studies (deuterium and 18O) and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy led to an advanced mechanism for the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
The hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron complex FePcF16 was recently shown to convert olefins into ketones in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of triethylsilane in ethanol at room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere. Herein, we describe an extensive mechanistic investigation for the conversion of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene into 2&#8208;acetylnaphthalene as model reaction. A variety of studies including deuterium&#8208; and 18O2&#8208;labeling experiments, ESI&#8208;MS, and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy were performed to identify the intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle of the oxidation process. Finally, a detailed and well&#8208;supported reaction mechanism for the FePcF16&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type oxidation is proposed.

         <title>In Vitro and In Vivo Sequestration of Methamphetamine by a Sulfated Acyclic CB[n]&#8208;Type Receptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take a chill pill: We investigate the interactions of three sulfated acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors toward a panel of drugs of abuse by 1H NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry. TetM0 is biocompatible, not mutagenic, and does not inhibit the hERG ion channel which paves the way toward in&#8197;vivo application. The hyperlocomotion exhibited by mice treated with methamphetamine can be reversed in&#8197;vivo by treatment with TetM0.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two new acyclic sulfated acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors (TriM0 and Me4TetM0) and investigations of their binding properties toward a panel of drugs of abuse (1&#8211;13) by a combination of 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. TetM0 is the most potent receptor with Ka&#8805;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 toward methamphetamine, fentanyl, MDMA and mephedrone. TetM0 is not cytotoxic toward HepG2 and HEK 293 cells below 100&#8197;&#956;M according to MTS metabolic and adenylate kinase release assays and is well tolerated in&#8197;vivo when dosed at 46&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1. TetM0 does not inhibit the hERG ion channel and is not mutagenic based on the Ames fluctuation test. Finally, in&#8197;vivo efficacy studies show that the hyperlocomotion of mice treated with methamphetamine can be greatly reduced by treatment with TetM0 up to 5&#8197;minutes later. TetM0 has potential as a broad spectrum in&#8197;vivo sequestrant for drugs of abuse.

         <title>Advancing Inorganic Coordination Chemistry by Spectroscopy of Isolated Molecules: Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advances in spectroscopic and computational methodologies have made possible the illustrated threefold synergetic approach which is considerably boosting our understanding of oligonuclear TM compounds. This review describes several of the corresponding advances in spectroscopic methodologies as related to studies of charged 3MET complexes in gas&#8208;phase.







Abstract
A unique feature of the work carried out in the Collaborative Research Center 3MET continues to be its emphasis on innovative, advanced experimental methods which hyphenate mass&#8208;selection with further analytical tools such as laser spectroscopy for the study of isolated molecular ions. This allows to probe the intrinsic properties of the species of interest free of perturbing solvent or matrix effects. This review explains these methods and uses examples from past and ongoing 3MET studies of specific classes of multicenter metal complexes to illustrate how coordination chemistry can be advanced by applying them. As a corollary, we will show how the challenges involved in providing well&#8208;defined, for example monoisomeric, samples of the molecular ions have helped to further improve the methods themselves thus also making them applicable to many other areas of chemistry.

         <dc:description>
A unique [2+2+1] annulation of phenol&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes intercepted by hydration is uncovered using catalytic cationic Rh(I) for a facile and modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quaternary stereocenters. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination.







Abstract
An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Double C&#8722;H Bond Activation in a Germylene&#8208;Rhodium Complex**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal tetrylenes offer new ways for chemical cooperation with great prospects for catalysis. Here we report on an unusual naked rhodium(I) site that is embraced by a bulky germylene in a pincer&#8208;like fashion. Cooperation across the Rh&#8722;Ge motif is illustrated by up to three C&#8722;H activation events, along with hydride and formal alkyl migrations between the two sites.







Abstract
Transition metal tetrylene complexes offer great opportunities for molecular cooperation due to the ambiphilic character of the group 14 element. Here we focus on the coordination of germylene [(ArMes2)2Ge&#8201;:] (ArMes=C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3)2) to [RhCl(COD)]2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), which yields a neutral germyl complex in which the rhodium center exhibits both &#951;6&#8208; and &#951;2&#8208;coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer&#8208;type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8722;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium&#8208;germyl species associated to three C&#8722;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer-type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8722;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium-germyl species associated to three C&#8722;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Hydrogen Oxalate Binding Motifs onto Dinuclear Cu and Ag Metal Phosphine Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To characterize the binding motifs of hydrogen oxalate (HOx) onto copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) phosphine complexes, we have invastigated [M1M2dcpm2(HOx)]+ (M=Cu, Ag; dcpm=bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)methane; abbreviated [CuCu]+ and [AgAg]+) in isolation. The 40&#8197;K N2 tagged IR&#8208;PD spectra gives evidence for two isomers of [CuCu]+ and three isomers of [AgAg]+, supported by DFT calculations. Two color IR&#8208;IR hole burning experiments indicate some minor amount of isomeric interconversions in [AgAg]+, whereas [CuCu]+ reveals a stiffer HOx coordination.







Abstract
We report the binding geometries of the isomers that are formed when the hydrogen oxalate ((CO2)2H=HOx) anion attaches to dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes of the form [M1M2dcpm2(HOx)]+ with M=Cu, Ag and dcpm=bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)methane, abbreviated [MM]+. These structures are established by comparison of isomer&#8208;selective experimental vibrational band patterns displayed by the cryogenically cooled and N2&#8208;tagged cations with DFT calculations of the predicted spectra for various local minima. Two isomeric classes are identified that feature either attachment of the carboxylate oxygen atoms to the two metal centers (end&#8208;on docking) or attachment of oxygen atoms on different carbon atoms asymmetrically to the metal ions (side&#8208;on docking). Within each class, there are additional isomeric variations according to the orientation of the OH group. This behavior indicates that HOx undergoes strong and directional coordination to [CuCu]+ but adopts a more flexible coordination to [AgAg]+. Infrared spectra of the bare ions, fragmentation thresholds and ion mobility measurements are reported to explore the behaviors of the complexes at ambient temperature.

         <title>Competing Reaction Pathways in Heterogeneously Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Allyl Cyanide: The Chemical Nature of Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanistic study on partial hydrogenation of allyl cyanide over Pd(111) model catalyst addressed by a combination of molecular beam techniques and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy is presented. Two competing reaction pathways were detected spectroscopically, resulting in formation of stable N&#8208;butylimine and unstable C&#8208;butylamine surface species. The successive evolution of the reaction intermediates for both pathways was monitored as a function of reaction temperature.







Abstract
We present a mechanistic study on the formation of an active ligand layer over Pd(111), turning the catalytic surface highly active and selective in partial hydrogenation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Specifically, we investigate the chemical composition of a ligand layer consisting of allyl cyanide deposited on Pd(111) and its dynamic changes under the hydrogenation conditions. On pristine surface, allyl cyanide largely retains its chemical structure and forms a layer of molecular species with the CN bond oriented nearly parallel to the underlying metal. In the presence of hydrogen, the chemical composition of allyl cyanide strongly changes. At 100&#8197;K, allyl cyanide transforms to unsaturated imine species, containing the C=C and C=N double bonds. At increasing temperatures, these species undergo two competing reaction pathways. First, the C=C bond become hydrogenated and the stable N&#8208;butylimine species are produced. In the competing pathway, the unsaturated imine reacts with hydrogen to fully hydrogenate the imine group and produce butylamine. The latter species are unstable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions and desorb from the surface, while the N&#8208;butylimine adsorbates formed in the first reaction pathway remain adsorbed and act as an active ligand layer in selective hydrogenation of acrolein.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Slow&#8208;Magnetic Relaxation in Pristine Ferrocenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocenium complexes show slow spin relaxation due to an unusual non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation. An external field is required for such behavior but magnetic dilution results in a considerable decrease of the field required. The energy of the first calculated vibrational mode agrees with the fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode contribution of the experimental spin relaxation times.







Abstract
We report the spin dynamic properties of non&#8208;substituted ferrocenium complexes. Ferrocenium shows a field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in DMF solution while cobaltocene lacks slow spin relaxation neither in powder nor in solution. Multireference quantum mechanical calculations give a non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation for ferrocenium with small first excitation energy that agrees with the relatively large measured magnetic anisotropy for a transition metal S=1/2 system. The analysis of the spin relaxation shows an important participation of quantum tunnelling, Raman, direct and local&#8208;mode mechanisms which depend on temperature and the external field conditions. The calculation of spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants for the vibrational modes shows that the first vibrational mode, despite having a low spin&#8208;phonon constant, is the most efficient process for the spin relaxation at low temperatures. In such conditions, vibrational modes with higher spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants are not populated. Additionally, the vibrational energy of this first mode is in excellent agreement with the experimental fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode mechanism.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Voltammetric Anion Sensing Under Flow**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensing with the flow: A continuous, real&#8208;time ion sensing methodology under flow, enabled by repeat voltammetry and accompanying data analysis, is reported for the first time, herein exemplified for halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated anion sensing at electroactive ferrocene&#8208;isophthalamide&#8208;(iodo)triazole films. The novel methodology enables sensing of multiple anionic targets, as well as long&#8208;term sensing over multiple hours with highly reproducible responses and minimal signal loss.







Abstract
The development of real&#8208;life applicable ion sensors, in particular those capable of repeat use and long&#8208;term monitoring, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we demonstrate, in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the real&#8208;time voltammetric sensing of anions under continuous flow in a 3D&#8208;printed microfluidic system. Electro&#8208;active anion receptive halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) ferrocene&#8208;isophthalamide&#8208;(iodo)triazole films were employed as exemplary sensory interfaces. Upon exposure to anions, the cathodic perturbations of the ferrocene redox&#8208;transducer are monitored by repeat square&#8208;wave voltammetry (SWV) cycling and peak fitting of the voltammograms by a custom&#8208;written MATLAB script. This enables the facile and automated data processing of thousands of SW scans and is associated with an over one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in limits of detection. In addition, this improved analysis enables tuning of the measurement parameters such that high temporal resolution can be achieved. More generally, this new flow methodology is extendable to a variety of other analytes, including cations, and presents an important step towards translation of voltammetric ion sensors from laboratory to real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8211;H activation via Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of iminophosphoryl&#8208;tethered ruthenium carbene complexes for activation of secondary phosphine P&#8211;H bonds is reported. Complexes of type [(p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;RuC(SO  2  Ph)(PPh  2  NR)] (with R = SiMe  3  or 4&#8208;C  6  H  4  &#8208;NO  2  ) were found to exhibit different reactivities depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine and the substituent at the iminophosphoryl moiety. Hence, the electron&#8208;rich silyl&#8208;substituted complex undergoes cyclometallation or shift of the imine moiety after cooperative activation of the P&#8211;H bond across the M=C linkage, depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine. Deuteration experiments and computational studies proved that cyclometallation is initiated by the activation process at the M=C bond and triggered by the high electron&#8208;density at the metal in the phosphido intermediates. Consistently, replacement of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group by the electron&#8208;withdrawing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl substituent allowed for the selective cooperative P&#8211;H activation to form stable activation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Pyrazine&#8208;Fused Carbene Au(I) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is conceived to inherit the advantages of both phosphorescent metal complexes and purely organic TADF compounds for high&#8208;performance electroluminescence. Herein a panel of new TADF Au(I) emitters has been designed and synthesized by using carbazole and pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the donor and acceptor ligands, respectively. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures show linear molecular shape and coplanar arrangement of the donor and acceptor with small dihedral angles of &lt;6.5  o  . The coplanar orientation and appropriate separation of the HOMO and LUMO in this type of molecules favoured the formation of charge&#8208;transfer excited state with appreciable oscillator strength. Together with a minor but essential heavy atom effect of Au ion, the complexes in doped films exhibit highly efficient (&#1060;~0.9) and short&#8208;lived (&lt; 1 &#956;s) green emissions via TADF. Computational studies on this class of emitters have been performed to decipher the key reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) pathway. In addition to a small energy splitting between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;E  ST  ), the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect was found to be larger at a specific torsion angle between the donor and acceptor planes which favours most the RISC process. This work&#160;provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters for OLED application.</dc:description>

         <title>19F MRI Probes for Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful imaging tools today, capable of displaying superior soft&#8208;tissue contrast. This review discusses developments in the field of  19  F MRI multimodal probes in combination with optical fluorescence imaging (OFI),  1  H MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, ultrasonography (USG), X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). In each case, multimodal  19  F MRI probes compensate for the deficiency of individual techniques and offer improved sensitivity or accuracy of detection over unimodal counterparts. Strategies for designing  19  F MRI multimodal probes are described with respect to their structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and the quality of images.</dc:description>

The structures of  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  and  Ph&#8208;azaBDP  were incontestably confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis, and  tBu&#8208;azaBDP 2  is more twisted than  Ph&#8208;azaBDP 5. tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s have significant photo&#8208;stability and enhanced water solubility.  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s possess excellent optical properties such as high molar extinction coefficients, broad full width half maxima, and large Stokes shifts, which can be comparable to those of the parent dye  Ph&#8208;azaBDP  . Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8211;t&#8208;Bu groups in  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and singlet oxygen generation ability of  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s are more effective than those of  Ph&#8208;azaBDP  , which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiations and Zincations of Aromatics and Heterocycles Triggered by Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed TMP&#8208;bases (TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl), such as TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl, TMP2Mg&#183;2LiCl, TMPZnCl&#183;LiCl and TMP2Zn&#183;2LiCl are outstanding reagents for the metalation of functionalized aromatics and heterocycles. In the presence of Lewis acids such as BF3&#183;OEt2  or MgCl2  , the metalation scope of such bases was dramatically increased and regioselectivity switches were achieved in the presence or absence of these Lewis acids. Furthermore, highly reactive lithium bases, such as TMPLi or Cy2NLi are also compatible with various Lewis acids such as MgCl2&#183;2LiCl, ZnCl2&#183;2LiCl or CuCN&#183;2LiCl. Performing such metalations in continuous flow using commercial setups permitted practical and convenient reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile para&#8208;substituted pyridine lanthanide coordination complexes allow late stage tailoring of complex function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of cationic and neutral p&#8208;Br and p&#8208;NO2 pyridine substituted Eu(III) and Gd(III) coordination complexes serve as versatile synthetic intermediates. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution occurs readily at the para position under mild conditions, allowing &#8232;C&#8211;N and C&#8211;C bond forming reactions to take place, permitting the introduction of azide, amino and alkynyl substituents. For Eu(III) complexes, this approach allows late stage tuning of absorption and emission spectral properties, exemplified by the lowering of the energy of an LMCT transtion accompanied by a reduction in the Eu&#8208;Npy bond length. Additionally, these complexes provide direct access to the corresponding Eu(II) analogues. With the Gd(III) series, the nature of the p&#8208;substituent does not significantly change the EPR properties (linewidth, relaxation times), as required for their development as EPR spin probes that can be readily conjugated to biomolecules under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Substitution behavior of the monodentate Cl ligand of a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes (terpyridine (tpy) = 2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine) is investigated.  1  H&#8208;NMR kinetic experiments of the dissociation of the chloro&#8208;ligand in D  2  O for the complexes [Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl (  1  , bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and [Ru(tpy)(dppz)Cl]Cl (  2  , dppz = dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine) as well as the binuclear complex [Ru(bpy)  2  (tpphz)Ru(tpy)Cl]Cl  3  (  3b  , tpphz = tetrapyrido[3,2&#8208;  a  :2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;  c  :3&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;  h  :2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;  j  ]phenazine) are conducted, showing increased stability of the chloride ligand for compound  2  and  3  due to the extended &#960;&#8208;system.

The WOC experiments suggest that the stability of monodentate (chloride) ligand strongly correlates to catalytic performance.&#160;A&#160;theoretical model of the mechanism of the oxygen evolution of compounds  1  and  2  is presented, suggesting that differences in the catalytic performance are indeed based on ligand stability.

         <title>Modification of Amorphous Mesoporous Zirconia Nanoparticles with Bisphosphonic Acids: A Straightforward Approach for Tailoring the Surface Properties of the Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of readily prepared bisphosphonic acids obtained through a thio&#8208;Michael addition of a wide range of commercially available thiols on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate enable the straightforward surface modification of amorphous mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles. By simple stirring of a buffered aqueous solution of the bisphosphonic acid bearing the desired side chain with the zirconia nanoparticles leads to the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles with different kinds of functional groups, charges and hydrophobic properties, with negligible release in neutral or acidic pH conditions. The modified nanoparticles were characterized by IR, XPS, &#950;&#8208;potential analysis to investigate the loading of the bisphosphonic acid, SEM to investigate the size and morphologies of the nanoparticles and  31  P and  1  H MAS NMR to investigate the coordination motif of the phosphonate units on the surface. All these analytical techniques demonstrated the strong affinity of the bisphosphonic moiety for the Zr(IV) metal centers. The functionalization with bisphosphonic acids represents a straightforward covalent approach for derivatization that is complementary to the use of typical  tris  &#8208;alkoxy&#8208;silane or trichloro&#8208;silane reagents largely employed for the functionalization of silica and metal oxide nanoparticles.</dc:description>

This Concept article aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. We first review the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials. Furthermore, we outline the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field.







Abstract
Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to its excellent structural stability and rapid Na+ conductivity. However, its electrochemical performances are restricted by the large bulk structure and poor electronic conductivity. The construction of porous NVP materials is a powerful method to improve the electrochemical properties. This concept aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. Herein, the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials are reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field are outlined.

An electrochemical enabled three component cascade phosphorylation of carbazoles, indoles,phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph2PH has been well developed. A variety of organophosphorus compounds containing P(O)&#8722;X ( X=N, O, S) bonds are produced in moderate to excellent yields (50 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
An electrochemical three component cascade phosphorylation reaction of various heteroatoms&#8208;containing nucleophiles including carbazoles, indoles, phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph2PH has been established. Electricity is used as the &#8220;traceless&#8221; oxidant and water and air are utilized as the &#8220;green&#8221; oxygen source. All kinds of structurally diverse organophosphorus compounds with P(O)&#8208;N/P(O)&#8208;O/P(O)&#8208;S bonds are assembled in moderate to excellent yields (three categories of phosphorylation products, 50 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield). A tentative free radical course is put forward to rationalize the reaction procedure.

         <title>Seven&#8208;Membered Cyclic Potassium Diamidoalumanyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 14971-14980, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven&#8208;membered cyclic potassium diamidoalumanyls react with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(sp3)&#8722;H bond and as a nucleophile with BPh3 and RN=C=NR (R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al&#8208;B&#8208; and Al&#8208;C&#8208;bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina&#8208;amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium with 18&#8208;cr&#8208;6 or 2,2,2&#8208;cryptand to provide either Al&#8722;K bonded or charge&#8208;separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; alumanyl anion.







Abstract
The seven&#8208;membered cyclic potassium alumanyl species, [{SiNMes}AlK]2 [{SiNMes}={CH2SiMe2N(Mes)}2; Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2], which adopts a dimeric structure supported by flanking K&#8208;aryl interactions, has been isolated either by direct reduction of the iodide precursor, [{SiNMes}AlI], or in a stepwise manner via the intermediate dialumane, [{SiNMes}Al]2. Although the intermediate dialumane has not been observed by reduction of a Dipp&#8208;substituted analogue (Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3), partial oxidation of the potassium alumanyl species, [{SiNDipp}AlK]2, where {SiNDipp}={CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2, provided the extremely encumbered dialumane [{SiNDipp}Al]2. [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 reacts with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(sp3)&#8208;H bond to provide the benzyl hydridoaluminate, [{SiNDipp}AlH(CH2Ph)]K, and as a nucleophile with BPh3 and RN=C=NR (R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al&#8208;B&#8208; and Al&#8208;C&#8208;bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina&#8208;amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium. Equimolar reactions with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 result in the corresponding monomeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiNDipp}Al&#8722;K(18&#8208;cr&#8208;6)], which provides a rare example of a direct Al&#8722;K contact. In contrast, complete encapsulation of the potassium cation of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2, either by an excess of 18&#8208;cr&#8208;6 or 2,2,2&#8208;cryptand, allows the respective isolation of bright orange charge&#8208;separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; [{SiNDipp}Al]&#8722; alumanyl anion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on this moiety indicate HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps in the of order 200&#8211;250&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven-membered cyclic potassium alumanyl species, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;}={CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N(Mes)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Mes=2,4,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], which adopts a dimeric structure supported by flanking K-aryl interactions, has been isolated either by direct reduction of the iodide precursor, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;}AlI], or in a stepwise manner via the intermediate dialumane, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;}Al]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Although the intermediate dialumane has not been observed by reduction of a Dipp-substituted analogue (Dipp=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), partial oxidation of the potassium alumanyl species, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where {SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}={CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N(Dipp)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, provided the extremely encumbered dialumane [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}Al]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bond to provide the benzyl hydridoaluminate, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)]K, and as a nucleophile with BPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and RN=C=NR (R=&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al-&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;- and Al-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina-amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium. Equimolar reactions with 18-crown-6 result in the corresponding monomeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}Al&#8722;K(18-cr-6)], which provides a rare example of a direct Al&#8722;K contact. In contrast, complete encapsulation of the potassium cation of [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, either by an excess of 18-cr-6 or 2,2,2-cryptand, allows the respective isolation of bright orange charge-separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}Al]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; alumanyl anion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on this moiety indicate HOMO-LUMO energy gaps in the of order 200&#8211;250&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Multiple Dimensional Assemblies from Tryptophan&#8208;Based Racemate</title>

Every dimension: Tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM) could assemble into 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers in ethanol/toluene, ethanol/H2O and ethanol/cyclohexane co&#8208;solvents (v:v=1&#8201;:&#8201;9), respectively. The uniform 0D nanospheres formed in ethanol/H2O under 4&#8201;&#176;C were able to convert into lamella spontaneously under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of the temperature&#8208;responsive morphological transformation, RPWM exhibited extremely high removal ability toward organic dye molecules and also possessed good reusability.







Abstract
Fabricating structural complex assemblies from simple amino acid&#8208;based derivatives is attracting great research interests due to their easy accessibility and preparation. However, the morphological regulation of racemates (an equimolar mixture of enantiomers) were largely overlooked. In this work, through rational modulation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, we achieved multiple dimensional architectures employing tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM). Upon assembling, 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers could be obtained depending on the solvents used. The corresponding morphology evolutions were successfully illustrated by changing the enantiomeric excess (ee) value. Moreover, for RPWM, uniform 0D nanospheres were formed in H2O under 4&#8201;&#176;C, which could spontaneously convert into lamella under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of its temperature&#8208;responsive phase change behavior, RPWM assemblies exhibited excellent removal efficiency for organic dye RhB, and could be reused for several consecutive cycles without significant changes in its removal performance. Taken together, it's rational to envision that the engineering of racemates assembly pathways can greatly increase the robustness in a wide variety of supramolecular materials and further lead to their blooming versatile applications.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 14876-14885, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly was employed to manipulate inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular interaction of PBI&#8208;based complexes (trigonal prism and dicycle). Two complexes exhibit distinct different properties on excited state process and aggregation behaviour due to their geometrical arrangements. Trigonal prism to dicycle transformation could be tracked by fluorescence change. (Note: ISC and SB&#8208;CS in graphic are intersystem crossing and symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation, respectively.)







Abstract
Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (2) and a trigonal prism (3) were generated via using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent, cis&#8208;(PEt3)2Pt(OTf)2&#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an ortho&#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (1), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (&#8764;13&#8201;%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC). 2, however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of &#8764;41&#8201;%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of 3 is merely &#8764;6&#8201;% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly, 3 could be fully transformed into 2 by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover, 2 tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but 3 does not show the property. Therefore, controlling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared via organic synthesis.

         <title>Mirror Symmetry Breaking and Network Formation in Achiral Polycatenars with Thioether Tail</title>

Spontaneous mirror&#8208;symmetry breaking. Achiral multichain &#960;&#8208;conjugated rod&#8208;like molecules form a series of chiral and achiral liquid crystalline networks as well as mirror symmetry broken liquids. The effect of thioalkyl chains on helical self&#8208;assembly and network formation is discussed.







Abstract
Mirror symmetry breaking in systems composed of achiral molecules is of importance for the design of functional materials for technological applications as well as for the understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous emergence of chirality. Herein, we report the design and molecular self&#8208;assembly of two series of rod&#8208;like achiral polycatenar molecules derived from a &#960;&#8208;conjugated 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene core with a fork&#8208;like triple alkoxylated end and a variable single alkylthio chain at the other end. In both series of liquid crystalline materials, differing in the chain length at the trialkoxylated end, helical self&#8208;assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated rods in networks occurs, leading to wide temperature ranges (&gt;200&#8197;K) of bicontinuous cubic network phases, in some cases being stable even around ambient temperatures. The achiral bicontinuous cubic Ia
d phase (gyroid) is replaced upon alkylthio chain elongation by a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken bicontinuous cubic phase (I23) and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso1[*]). Further chain elongation results in removing the I23 phase and the re&#8208;appearance of the Ia
d phase with different pitch lengths. In the second series an additional tetragonal phase separates the two cubic phase types.

         <title>Photoswitchable Composite Polymer Electrolytes Using Spiropyran&#8208;Immobilized Nanoporous Templates</title>

A photoswitchable ionic conductivity of spiropyran&#8208;based composite polymer electrolyte is developed and demonstrated. The photoisomerization of the spiropyran derivative results in a tunable ionic conductivity with a maximum 30&#8201;% difference under UV and visible irradiations. The quantitative and qualitative ATR&#8208;FTIR data reveal the interactions of the ions and the grafted molecules at the interfaces. The knowledge obtained from this work provides a potential platform for synthetic electrolytes with tailored conducting functionality.







Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) with smart, stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics have gained considerable attention owing to their noninvasive manipulation and applications in future technologies. To address this potential, in this work, we demonstrate photoresponsive composite polymer electrolytes, consisting of gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) and spiropyran&#8208;immobilized nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (SP&#8208;AAO) templates. Under UV irradiation, the close SP form isomerizes to the open merocyanine (MC) form, creating extremely polarized AAO surfaces; whereas, under visible light irradiation, the MC form reverts to the SP form, creating neutral surface conditions. The electrostatic interactions between ions and AAO surfaces are investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, the behavior of ionic conductivity of the GPE@SP&#8208;AAO is found to be consistent with the kinetics of isomerization tracked by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This work provides a promising platform for developing next&#8208;generation photoelectronic smart devices.

         <title>The Introduction of a Cysteine Residue Modulates The Mechanical Properties of Aromatic&#8208;Based Solid Aggregates and Self&#8208;Supporting Hydrogels</title>

Hydrogels based on aromatic peptides can be generated taking advantages from &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bondings between the side chain of amino acids. The insertion of a crosslinkable cysteine residue in the middle of the peptide motif could allow the achievement of novel materials with improved mechanical properties for tissue engineering applications.







Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based hydrogels, originated by multiscale self&#8208;assembling phenomenon, have been proposed as multivalent tools in different technological areas. Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations pointed out the capability of completely aromatic peptides to gelificate if hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces are opportunely balanced. Here, the effect produced by the introduction of a Cys residue in the heteroaromatic sequence of (FY)3 and in its PEGylated variant was evaluated. The physicochemical characterization indicates that both FYFCFYF and PEG8&#8208;FYFCFYF are able to self&#8208;assemble in supramolecular nanostructures whose basic cross&#8208;&#946; motif resembles the one detected in the ancestor (FY)3 assemblies. However, gelification occurs only for FYFCFYF at a concentration of 1.5&#8197;wt%. After cross&#8208;linking of cysteine residues, the hydrogel undergoes to an improvement of the rigidity compared to the parent (FY)3 assemblies as suggested by the storage modulus (G&#8217;) that increases from 970 to 3360&#8197;Pa. The mechanical properties of FYFCFYF are compatible with its potential application in bone tissue regeneration. Moreover, the avalaibility of a Cys residue in the middle of the peptide sequence could allow the hydrogel derivatization with targeting moieties or with biologically relevant molecules.

         <title>Photophysics of Azobenzene Constrained in a UiO Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Effects of Pressure, Solvation and Dynamic Disorder</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 14871-14875, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putting the pressure on azobenzene photophysics: When locked in a UiO metal&#8211;organic framework, the azobenzene chromophore is geometrically constrained but exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. This is a unique and advantageous environment in which to explore fundamental photophysical properties. Optical spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell enables the photophysical consequences of pressure&#8208;induced changes in solvation and conformation of the chromophore to be observed and correlated with crystallographic data.







Abstract
Photophysical studies of chromophoric linkers in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are undertaken commonly in the context of sensing applications, in search of readily observable changes of optical properties in response to external stimuli. The advantages of the MOF construct as a platform for investigating fundamental photophysical behaviour have been somewhat overlooked. The linker framework offers a unique environment in which the chromophore is geometrically constrained and its structure can be determined crystallographically, but it exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure studies enable the photophysical consequences of controlled, incremental changes in local environment or conformation to be observed and correlated with structural data. This approach is demonstrated in the present study of the trans&#8208;azobenzene chromophore, constrained in the form of the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azobenzenedicarboxylate (abdc) linker, in a UiO topology framework. Previously unobserved effects of pressure&#8208;induced solvation and conformational distortion on the lowest energy, n&#960;* transition are reported, and interpreted the light of crystallographic data. It was found that trans&#8208;azobenzene remains non&#8208;fluorescent (with a quantum yield less than 10&#8722;4) despite the prevention of trans&#8208;cis isomerization by the constraining MOF structure. We propose that efficient non&#8208;radiative decay is mediated by the local, pedal&#8208;like twisting of the azo group that is evident as dynamic disorder in the crystal structure.

         <title>Study of the Cycloaddition of CO2 with Styrene Oxide Over Six&#8208;Connected spn Topology MOFs (Zr, Hf) at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 14947-14963, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs with six Zr6 or Hf6 clusters were used for the catalytic CO2 and styrene oxide cycloaddition reactions. They all have the same spn topology skeletons, and ortho&#8208;octahedral morphology. MOF&#8208;818&#8208;Zr with higher acid site density exhibited good catalytic activity and stability at room temperature and an initial pressure of 1&#8197;bar CO2. DFT results showed that the metal was coordinated to the styrene oxide and the halogen attacked the &#946;&#8208;carbon of the styrene oxide (ND&#8208;ERO).







Abstract
A series of MOFs with a 6&#8208;connected spn topology were synthesized (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(Zr, Hf), PCN&#8208;777&#8208;(Zr, Hf), MOF&#8208;818&#8208;(Zr, Hf)). Through the in&#8197;situ DRIFTS of NH3 adsorption&#8208;desorption, we found that the activated catalyst mainly contains Lewis acid sites. The effects of different organic ligands on the Lewis acid of the Zr6 cluster were analyzed by XPS and NH3&#8208;TPD, and the relative Lewis acidity of the same metal was obtained: PCN&#8208;777&gt;MOF&#8208;808&gt;MOF&#8208;818. In the Py&#8208;FTIR results, we confirmed that MOF&#8208;818 has a higher acid site density. In the activity test, MOFs with mesoporous structure showed better catalytic activity under normal temperature and pressure. Among them, MOF&#8208;818 can still maintain a high degree of crystallinity after catalysis. Finally, we use density functional theory to propose the mechanism of the cycloaddition reaction of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. The results show that the metal is coordinated with styrene oxide and halogens attack the &#946; carbon of the epoxide.

Trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis conversion (&#8764;50&#8201;% efficiency) from the initial trans PDI&#8208;dimer by 355&#8197;nm pulsed laser light, and its reversal, cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans, process by 435&#8197;nm laser light irradiation has been possible to accomplish. Efficient fluorescence quenching in the PDI&#8208;dimer, more so for the cis isomer was witnessed, and such quenching increased with increasing solvent polarity. DFT&#8208;calculated geometry and electronic structures helped in visualizing the charge transfer in the PDI&#8208;dimer in both isomeric forms, and also revealed certain degree of participation of the azobenzene entity in the charge transfer events. Femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies confirmed occurrence of both charge transfer followed by charge separation in the studied PDI&#8208;dimer in both trans and cis forms in polar solvents, and the evaluated time constants from Global target analysis revealed accelerated events in the cis PDI&#8208;dimer due to proximity effects. The present study offers key insights on the role of the azobenzene bridge, and the dimer geometry in governing the excited state charge transfer and separation in symmetrically linked PDI dimer.

         <title>Fabrication of ZnSe/C Hollow Polyhedrons for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 14989-14995, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons are successfully synthesized by selenization of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) coating. The protection of C layer derived from RF coating layer and Ostwald ripening during the process of selenization play important roles in promoting formation of ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons. As lithium ion batteries anode, the ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons exhibit good rate performance and long&#8208;term cycle stability.







Abstract
ZnSe has got extensive attention for high&#8208;performance LIBs anode due to its remarkable theoretical capacity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the large volume variation for the ZnSe in the discharge/charge processes brings about rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance. Herein, ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons are successfully synthesized by selenization of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) coating. The protection of C layer derived from RF coating layer and Ostwald ripening during the process of selenization play important roles in promoting formation of ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons. The ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons exhibit good rate performance and long&#8208;term cycle stability (345&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 up to 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) anode. The improved electrochemical performance is benefit from the unique ZnSe/C hollow structure, in which the hollow structure can effectively avoid terrible volume expansion, and the thin ZnSe/C shell can not only provide adequate diffusion paths of lithium ions and but also enhance the electronic conductivity.

         <title>Fluorescent Supramolecular Organic Frameworks Constructed by Amidinium&#8208;Carboxylate Salt Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 15006-15012, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation, TPE4+, and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. These self&#8208;assembled structures can be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli and are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8201;%&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation.







Abstract
We report here a set of fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) that incorporate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) units within their frameworks. The fluorescent SOFs of this study were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation TPE4+ and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray di&#64256;raction analyses revealed that the length of the dicarboxylate anion bridges has a considerable impact on the structural features of the resulting frameworks. Nevertheless, all SOFs prepared in the context of the present study were found to display emissive features characteristic of TPE&#8208;based AIE luminogens with only a modest dependence on the structural specifics being seen. The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli. This reversible structural behavior is consistent with their SOF nature.

The synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand chromium(III) complexes, [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+, where L represents a macrocyclic binucleating hexaamine&#8208;dithiophenolato ligand and R=Me or Ph, has been achieved. The complexes exhibit a relatively strong intramolecular ferromagnetic exchange interaction that leads to an S=3 spin ground state (J &#8764;24&#8211;34&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The complexes emit at 750&#8197;nm (&#934;L=45&#8201;%) by excitation into the intense LMCT and d&#8208;d* bands.







Abstract
The synthesis, structure, magnetic, and photophysical properties of two dinuclear, luminescent, mixed&#8208;ligand [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+ complexes (R=CH3 (1), Ph (2)) of a 24&#8208;membered binucleating hexa&#8208;aza&#8208;dithiophenolate macrocycle (L)2&#8722; are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals an edge&#8208;sharing bioctahedral N3Cr(&#956;&#8208;SR)2(&#956;1,3&#8208;O2CR)CrN3 core structure with &#956;1,3&#8208;bridging carboxylate groups. A ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the electron spins of the Cr3+ ions leads to a high&#8208;spin (S=3) ground state. The coupling constants (J=+24.2(1)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (1), +34.8(4)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (2), H=&#8722;2JS1S2) are significantly larger than in related bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;alkoxido&#8208;&#956;&#8208;carboxylato structures. DFT calculations performed on both complexes reproduce both the sign and strength of the exchange interactions found experimentally. Frozen methanol&#8208;dichloromethane 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 solutions of 1 and 2 luminesce at 750&#8197;nm when excited into the 4LMCT state on the 4A2 &#8594; 2T1 (&#957;2) bands (&#955;exc=405&#8197;nm). The absolute quantum yields (&#934;L) for 1 and 2 were found to be strongly temperature dependent. At 77&#8197;K in frozen MeOH/CH2Cl2 glasses, &#934;L=0.44&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 1), &#934;L=0.45&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 2).

Reactions of iron and cobalt metalates with di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane readily afford 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The corresponding 1,3&#8208;isomers were accessed by dimerisation of tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne on the metal centre. The reactivity of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward electrophiles was studied and the electronic structures of the new metalates were investigated by spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Reactions of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (1) with cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208; or anthracene&#8208;stabilised metalate anions of iron and cobalt consistently afford complexes of the rarely encountered 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene ligand, which have previously been very challenging synthetic targets. The subsequent reactivity of 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward various electrophiles has also been investigated and is compared to reactions of related 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The results highlight the distinct reactivity of such isomeric species, showing that the 1,2&#8208;isomers can act as precursors for previously unknown triphospholium ligands. The electronic structures of the new complexes were investigated by several methods, including NMR, EPR and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopies as well as quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>

Superconducting tetrahydrides: First&#8208;principles calculations show that the distance between the hydrogen atoms comprising the quasi&#8208;molecular H2 units in the metal tetrahydrides that emerge as being stable under pressure can be tuned via the choice of the metal, as well as chemical and physical pressure. Vibrations of the H&#8722;H bond are important for the superconducting mechanism.







Abstract
Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr2Si2 structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these 
 symmetry MH4 compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H
 units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH4, ScH4 and ZrH4 reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H
 units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH4, modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms are also key contributors, and soften substantially at lower pressures.

         <title>Breathing&#8208;Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Breathing exercises: Two Zn&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks showed reversible structural flexibility through the breathing phenomenon upon the addition and removal of guest molecules. Moreover, these two MOF compounds demonstrated selective sorption of C8 alkyl aromatics in their binary mixtures.







Abstract
The breathing phenomenon in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has revealed supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions that could be beneficial for chemical separation in numerous industrial applications. The cost&#8208;effective purification of C8 alkyl aromatics such as o&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, p&#8208;xylene, and ethylbenzene remains challenging owing to their similar molecular structures, boiling points, kinetic diameters, polarities, etc. Herein, we report two Zn&#8208;based pillar&#8208;bilayered MOFs, denoted [Zn2(aip)2(pillar)] (aip=5&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid; pillar: bpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or bpe=1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) that exhibit a breathing effect depending on the adsorbed guest molecules. Guest&#8208;dependent sorption studies in organic solvents such as N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide, methanol, benzene, and water vapor display reversible structural flexibility through the breathing effect in both framework compounds. The experiments conducted on C8&#8208;alkyl aromatics resulting in both MOF compounds can access these isomers in the shrunken pores, and thereby expand the pore size by framework breathing. In C8 binary mixtures, these Zn&#8208;MOFs exhibit selective sorption properties based on the different interactions between guest C8 aromatics and the framework structure.

         <title>A Novel Strategy to Design and Construct AIE&#8208;active Mechanofluorochromic Materials via Regulation of Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 14964-14970, October 25, 2021. </description>

In this work, tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives were synthesized and investigated with regulation of molecular structure. The results illustrated that these compounds exhibited obvious AIE characteristics. The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene rings) causes twisted conformations of the molecules that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid&#8208;state emission. Significantly, two of these compounds also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior with color changes between blue and green emissions.







Abstract
In this work, we first designed and synthesized tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives TM&#8208;1&#8211;4 via regulation of molecular structure, which were consisted of 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline, 1H&#8208;phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole, 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)dipyridine moieties and AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene units, respectively. The results illustrated that TM&#8208;1&#8211;4 exhibited clear AIE characteristics. Meanwhile, TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 show excellent solid emission properties (&#934;TM&#8208;2=13.73&#8201;% and &#934;TM&#8208;3=36.21&#8201;%), whereas TM&#8208;1 and TM&#8208;4 exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;TM&#8208;1=1.48&#8201;% and &#934;TM&#8208;4=4.83&#8201;%). The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene ring) causes twisted conformations of the molecule that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid emission(&#934;TM&#8208;2&lt;&#934;TM&#8208;3, &#934;TM&#8208;1&lt;&#934;TM&#8208;4). Significantly, TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;TM&#8208;2=43&#8197;nm and &#916;&#955;TM&#8208;3=41&#8197;nm) with color changes between blue and green emissions. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) suggested the disordered state of ground sample could be readily returned to an ordered crystalline. Therefore, the mechanochromisms of TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 are ascribable to the phase transformation between crystal and amorphous structure. The single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of TM&#8208;2 reveals a twisted conformation for TPE moiety and the absence of &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular stacking. These excellent optical properties of TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 make them potentially applications in mechanochromic materials and imaging agents.

   &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=13.73&#8201;% and &#934;&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=36.21&#8201;%), whereas &lt;b&gt;TM-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TM-4&lt;/b&gt; exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TM-1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=1.48&#8201;% and &#934;&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TM-4&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=4.83&#8201;%). The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene ring) causes twisted conformations of the molecule that prevents &#960;-&#960; stacking and enhances solid emission(&#934;&lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;&#934;&lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt;, &#934;&lt;b&gt;TM-1&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;&#934;&lt;b&gt;TM-4&lt;/b&gt;). Significantly, &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt; also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=43&#8197;nm and &#916;&#955;&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=41&#8197;nm) with color changes between blue and green emissions. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) suggested the disordered state of ground sample could be readily returned to an ordered crystalline. Therefore, the mechanochromisms of &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt; are ascribable to the phase transformation between crystal and amorphous structure. The single crystal X-ray analysis of &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt; reveals a twisted conformation for &lt;b&gt;TPE&lt;/b&gt; moiety and the absence of &#960;-&#960; intermolecular stacking. These excellent optical properties of &lt;b&gt;TM-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TM-3&lt;/b&gt; make them potentially applications in mechanochromic materials and imaging agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Exotic physical properties are often exhibited by compounds crystallizing in the ubiquitous ThCr2Si2 structure type illustrated in the picture. A plethora of metal tetrahydrides belonging to this family, with metal cations, H&#8208; and quasimolecular H2 units, have been synthesized in diamond anvil cells and/or predicted to be stable under pressure. A theoretical investigation unveils why some are superconducting, whereas others are not. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Bi and E. Zurek (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102679).

A tale of mirrors: Bioisosteres are molecules resulting from the exchange of atoms or moieties with a functionally similar alternative to create a new molecule with similar biological properties to the parent compound. They could be described as an &#8220;imperfect&#8221; reflection in the mirror and are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry. Though almost identical, their synthesis often implies very different routes and starting materials. In their Communication, F.&#8197;H. Lutter and M. Jouffroy describe a mild and functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant synthesis of (hetero)aryl alkynes from the corresponding carboxylic acids toward the synthesis of triazole bioisosters. (DOI: 10.1002/chem. 202102130).

         <title>Front Cover: Breathing&#8208;Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Chem. Eur. J. 60/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
A key point of our work is selective adsorption of a C8 isomer with the assistance of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) breathing, which can be further applied to C8 isomer separation. When a C8 isomer mixture (colored balls) is applied to the MOF from an inlet bottle, the MOF starts to preferentially adsorb a single isomer (green balls) in the pores of MOF by breathing, as depicted by the expanding of the empty cages (MOFs) by incorporating the balls. As a result, the single C8 isomer is selectively isolated from the mixture, which is collected in the other bottle. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;C.&#8197;Rao, M.&#8197;Yoon et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102640).

         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of Au18 nanoclusters revealed an extremely high quantum efficiency of 5.5 relative to that of Ru(bpy)32+, due to the exposed kernel facets, electrocatalytic loops and overlapped oxidation potentials of Au18 and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as co&#8208;reactant. ECL peak maxima at 832 and 850 nm were unambiguously identified as emissions from Au180*, Au181+* and Au182+* by means of spooling ECL and photoluminescence spectroscopy. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hesari and Z. Ding (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102926).

Hydrogen atoms sometimes react far faster than deuterium atoms. Reactions can proceed over 100 times faster with hydrogen, or the deuterium reaction may not be observed at all. Examples of large kinetic isotope effects throughout organotransition metal chemistry are reviewed. Possible causes for these observed effects are discussed, including vibrational differences, multistep reactions, and proton tunneling.

Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs, kH/kD) above the typical limit of 7 are reviewed, for organometallic reaction types from protonation of clusters to catalytic C&#8722;H activation. The KIEs are as large as 105, or even so large that reactivity is unobserved for deuterium. Large KIEs in organometallics have been explained by a combination of (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step.







Abstract
The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is key to understanding reaction mechanisms in many areas of chemistry and chemical biology, including organometallic chemistry. This ratio of rate constants, kH/kD, typically falls between 1&#8211;7. However, KIEs up to 105 have been reported, and can even be so large that reactivity with deuterium is unobserved. We collect here examples of large KIEs across organometallic chemistry, in catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, along with their mechanistic interpretations. Large KIEs occur in proton transfer reactions such as protonation of organometallic complexes and clusters, protonolysis of metal&#8211;carbon bonds, and dihydrogen reactivity. C&#8722;H activation reactions with large KIEs occur with late and early transition metals, photogenerated intermediates, and abstraction by metal&#8208;oxo complexes. We categorize the mechanistic interpretations of large KIEs into the following three types: (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step. This comprehensive collection of large KIEs in organometallics provides context for future mechanistic interpretation.

         <title>Salicylideneaniline is a Photoswitchable Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 60, Page 14831-14835, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicylideneaniline has been discovered to be an organic photoswitchable ferroelectric crystal with a type of photo&#8208;induced enol&#8722;keto structural isomerization accompanied by evident photochromism, which is different from the thermodynamic order&#8208;disorder or displacive one. The microscopic ferroelectric polarization can be quickly and reversibly switched upon UV light irradiation, holding great promise for developing optical control of smart devices in the future.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the first ferroelectric Rochelle salt, most ferroelectrics have been investigated showing thermally triggered symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition. Although photochromism arising from geometrical isomerization was reported as early as 1867, such photoswitchable ferroelectric crystals have scarcely been developed to date. Herein, we report that salicylideneaniline is a photochromic ferroelectric crystal. Upon photoirradiation, the dielectric constant shows obvious switching between high and low dielectric states, and more importantly, the ferroelectric polarization demonstrates quick and reversible switching. This work opens the gate to developing photoswitchable ferroelectrics, which holds great potential for applications in optically controlled smart devices.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Aminomethylation of Aromatic Sulfones Promoted by Eosin Y</title>

A photocatalytic aminomethylation of heterocycles with organic dye is reported. The C&#8722;C bond formation through a aminomethyl radical formation enables access to a series of functionalized heterocycles in one step with no need of transition metals.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation of heteroaryls promoted by eosin Y under green light irradiation is reported. A large variety of &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilylamines as precursor of &#945;&#8208;aminomethyl radical species were engaged to functionalize sulfonyl&#8208;heteroaryls following a Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (HAS) pathway. This method has provided a range of &#945;&#8208;aminoheteroaryl compounds including a functionalized natural product. The mechanism of this late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryls was investigated and suggests the formation of a sulfonyl radical intermediate over a reductive quenching cycle.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochemiluminescence from Au18 Nanoclusters</title>

         <dc:description>
Highest ECL quantum efficiency: Near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (NIR&#8211;ECL) of Au18(SC6H11)140 nanoclusters was explicitly explored; it reveals the highest ever quantum efficiency of 5.5 relative to that of standard Ru(bpy)32+ for the Au nanocluster family. ECL peak wavelengths of 832 and 848&#8197;nm were assigned unambiguously to the emission from Au180*, Au181+* and Au182+* in terms of spooling ECL and photoluminescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Bright, near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (NIR&#8211;ECL) of Au18 nanoclusters is reported herein. Spooling ECL and photoluminescence spectroscopy were used to track and link NIR emissions at 832 and 848&#8197;nm to three emissive species, Au180*, Au181+* and Au182+*, with a considerably high ECL efficiency of 5.5 relative to that of the gold standard Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA (with 5&#8211;6&#8201;% reported ECL efficiency). The unprecedentedly high efficiency is due to the overlapped oxidation potentials of Au180 and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine as co&#8208;reactant, the exposed facets of Au180 gold core, and electrocatalytic loops. These discoveries will add a new member to the efficient NIR&#8208;ECL gold nanoclusters family and bring more potential applications.

         <title>Facile Conversion of Molecularly Complex (Hetero)aryl Carboxylic Acids into Alkynes for Accelerated SAR Exploration</title>

Bringing molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into the bioisostere world: A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation is reported that allows the synthesis of aryl alkynes from highly functionalized aryl and heteroaryl carboxylic acids. The reaction shows an unmatched substrate scope mainly thanks to its remarkably mild reaction conditions using a homogenous Pd/Cu bimetallic system. The utility of this protocol was showcased by the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8722;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization by copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8722;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation that allows the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labeled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.

More stability, less toxicity: We demonstrate an efficient electrophilic N&#8208;cyanation of primary and secondary amines with a stable and less&#8208;toxic cyanobenziodoxole reagent. This synthetically practicable strategy allows the construction of a wide variety of cyanamides under very mild and simple conditions with a broad functional group compatibility, which provides a complementary method to existing procedures for the synthesis of cyanamides.

The asymmetric catalytic synthesis of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines by using a three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar&#8208;cycloaddition reaction is investigated.







Abstract
An asymmetric three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinolines, bromoacetates and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amide is realized by using a chiral N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;Y(OTf)3 complex as the catalyst. The process includes a base&#8208;promoted formation of dihydroisoquinolium ylides in&#8197;situ, and a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amides. A series of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines are obtained in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Alkyne Aminopalladation/Heck and Suzuki Cascades: An Approach to Tetrasubstituted Enamines</title>

         <dc:description>
Internal alkynes have been used in combination with tosylamides and the Narasaka leaving group to form tetra(hetero)substituted enamines in an aminopalladation cascade reaction. The cascade was terminated either intramolecularly by a Heck reaction or intermolecularly in a Suzuki&#8208;type reaction with a boronic acid.







Abstract
Alkyne aminopalladation reactions starting from tosylamides are reported. The emerging vinylic Pd species are converted either in an intramolecular Heck reaction with olefinic units or in an intermolecular Suzuki reaction by using boronic acids exhibiting broad functional group tolerance. Tetra(hetero)substituted tosylated enamines are obtained in a simple one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>The Role of Surface Curvature in Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for their catalytic performance. This Minireview summarizes the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy&#8208;related applications, including the preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, the applications of these electrocatalysts in HER, OER, ORR, and CO2 RR, and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.







Abstract
Excessive consumption of fossil fuels has caused unavoidable environmental problems. The development of renewable and clean alternatives is essential for the sustainable and green development of human society. Electrocatalysts are most important parts in these energy&#8208;related devices. Recently, scientists found that the surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for the improvement of catalytic performance and the optimization of intrinsic catalytic activity during electrocatalytic process.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The surface curvature&lt;/b&gt; of electrocatalysts could play an important role for their catalytic performance. This Minireview summarizes the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy-related applications, including the preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, the applications of these electrocatalysts in HER, OER, ORR, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; RR, and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive consumption of fossil fuels has caused unavoidable environmental problems. The development of renewable and clean alternatives is essential for the sustainable and green development of human society. Electrocatalysts are most important parts in these energy-related devices. Recently, scientists found that the surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for the improvement of catalytic performance and the optimization of intrinsic catalytic activity during electrocatalytic process. The role of surface curvature in electrocatalysts is still under investigating. In this minireview, we summarized the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy-related applications. This review mainly involves the strategies for preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, three typical electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures (curled surface, onion-like structure, and spiral structure), and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>THF&#8208;solvated Heavy Alkali Metal Benzyl Compounds (Na, Rb, Cs): Defined Deprotonation Reagents for Alkali Metal Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of THF&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds provides a decisive toolbox for alkali metal mediation chemistry and the introduction of the heavier congeners of lithium into small molecules. Crystal structures, NMR studies as well as quantum chemical calculations give detailed insights into these compounds. Experimental investigations towards deprotonations with application in aminometalation reactions are presented.







Abstract
The incorporation of heavy alkali metals into substrates is both challenging and essential for many reactions. Here, we report the formation of THF&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds [PhCH2M&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(thf)n] (M=Na, Rb, Cs). The synthesis was carried out by deprotonation of toluene with the bimetallic mixture n&#8208;butyllithium/alkali metal tert&#8208;butoxide and selective crystallization from THF of the defined benzyl compounds. Insights into the molecular structure in the solid as well as in solution state are gained by single crystal X&#8208;ray experiments and NMR spectroscopic studies. The compounds could be successfully used as alkali metal mediating reagents. The example of caesium showed the convenient use by deprotonating acidic C&#8722;H as well as N&#8722;H compounds to gain insight into the aminometalation using these reagents.

         <title>Bioengineered Protein&#8208;based Adhesives for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature, many bioengineered proteins have been designed and expressed to fabricate protein&#8208;based bioadhesives, including elastin&#8208;like polypeptides, mussel&#8208;foot proteins, and spider silk spidroin. In this context, the fabrication and adhesion performance of bioengineered protein&#8208;based bioadhesives are summarized. In particular, the biomedical applications of such protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented in each section. Perspectives and challenges of bioengineered protein&#8208;based bioadhesives are also highlighted.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based adhesives with their robust adhesion performance and excellent biocompatibility have been extensively explored over years. In particular, the unique adhesion behaviours of mussel and sandcastle worm inspired the development of synthetic adhesives. However, the chemical synthesized adhesives often demonstrate weak underwater adhesion performance and poor biocompatibility/biodegradability, limiting their further biomedical applications. In sharp contrast, genetically engineering endows the protein&#8208;based adhesives the ability to maintain underwater adhesion property as well as biocompatibility/biodegradability. Herein, we outline recent advances in the design and development of protein&#8208;based adhesives by genetic engineering. We summarize the fabrication and adhesion performance of elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;based adhesives, followed by mussel foot protein (mfp) based adhesives and other sources protein&#8208;based adhesives, such as, spider silk spidroin and suckerin. In addition, the biomedical applications of these bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented. Finally, we give a brief summary and perspective on the future development of bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives.

         <title>Controllable Macroscopic Chirality of Coordination Polymers through pH and Anion&#8208;Mediated Weak Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphologies of 1D coordination polymers of GdIII(R&#8208;pempHx)3(anion)(3&#8208;3x) can be controlled by the combined effect of pH and anions. Superhelices were formed when anions with larger sizes and enhanced anion&#8208;chain interactions, such as I&#8722; (and I3&#8722;), C6H5SO3&#8722; and CF3SO3&#8722;, were present in the systems. When the anion is CF3SO3&#8722;, a complete chirality inversion from left&#8208; to right&#8208;handedness was observed by raising the pH of the reaction mixture.







Abstract
Helical architectures with controllable helical sense bias have recently attracted considerable interest for mimicking biological helices and developing novel chiral materials. Coordination polymers (CPs), composed of metal ion nodes and organic linkers, are intriguing systems showing tunable structures and functions. However, CPs with helical morphologies have rarely been explored so far. Particularly, chirality inversion through external stimulus has not been achieved in helical CPs. In this work, we carried out an in&#8208;depth investigation on the self&#8208;assembly of 1D gadolinium(III) phosphonate CPs using GdX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) and Gd(RSO3) (R=CH3, C6H5, CF3) as metal sources and R&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethylamino)methyl phosphonic acid (R&#8208;pempH2) as ligand. Superhelices were formed by precise control of the interchain interactions through different intercalated anions. Furthermore, the twisting direction of superhelices could be controlled by synergistic effect of anions and pH. This study may provide a new route to fabricate helical nanostructures of CPs with a desirable chiral sense and help understand the inner mechanism of the self&#8208;assembly process of macroscopic helical structures of molecular systems.

         <title>Nonheme Iron Imido Complexes Bearing a Non&#8208;Innocent Ligand: A Synthetic Chameleon Species in Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a theoretical approach, iron(V and VI)&#8208;imido species with non&#8208;innocent ligands are revealed to have multiple energetically close&#8208;lying electromers, sometimes even without changing spin states, reminiscent of the so&#8208;called Compound I species in Cytochrome P450. In addition to showing multi&#8208;spin state reactivity, multiple electronic configurations within the same spin state are found to potentially affect the reactivity. Furthermore, the mechanism of benzene formation from cyclohexadiene is also explained in detail by theory.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;imido complexes can perform C&#8722;H activation and sulfimidation reactions, but are far less studied than the more ubiquitous iron&#8208;oxo species. As case studies, we have looked at a recently published iron(V)&#8208;imido ligand &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex, which is formally an iron(VI)&#8208;imido complex [FeV(NTs)(TAML+.)] (1; NTs=tosylimido), and an iron(V)&#8208;imido complex [FeV(NTs)(TAML)]&#8722; (2). Using a theoretical approach, we found that they have multiple energetically close&#8208;lying electromers, sometimes even without changing spin states, reminiscent of the so&#8208;called Compound I in Cytochrome P450. When studying their reactivity theoretically, it is indeed found that their electronic structures may change to perform efficient oxidations, emulating the multi&#8208;spin state reactivity in FeIVO systems. This is actually in contrast to the known [FeV(O)(TAML)]&#8722; species (3), where the reactions occur only on the ground spin state. We also looked into the whole reaction pathway for the C&#8722;H bond activation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene by these intermediates to reproduce the experimentally observed products, including steps that usually attract no interest (neither theoretically nor experimentally) due to their non&#8208;rate&#8208;limiting status and fast reactivity. A new &#8220;clustering non&#8208;rebound mechanism&#8221; is presented for this C&#8722;H activation reaction.

A new &#8220;clustering non-rebound mechanism&#8221; is presented for this C&#8722;H activation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Organic SIB anode: Using polyazaacene analogue PQL as the anode, SIBs displayed stable electrochemical performances and great rate capability. This work would provide insights into the application of organic polymer electrodes in rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
The high theoretical specific capacity, strong structural designability and relatively inexpensive manufacturing cost make the exploration of organic electrode materials more attractive in recent years. In this article, owing to the large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, plenty of nitrogen heteroatoms and multiring aromatic system, polyazaacene analogue poly(1,6&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3&#8197;g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,8&#8208;triyl&#8208;7&#8208;(2H)&#8208;ylidene&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethylidene) (PQL) was applied as the anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). PQL was almost insoluble in conventional liquid organic electrolyte (1&#8197;M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (v:v=1&#8201;:&#8201;1) with 5&#8201;% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)), which strongly improved its cycle stability. The initial discharge capacity was obtained to be 1825&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 100&#8197;mA g&#8722;1 and stabilized at 317&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles with the coulombic efficiency as high as 97&#8201;%. It not only showed good rate capability at high current densities (202, 183&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1 and 1.5&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1) but also had a superior energy density around 290&#8197;Wh&#8197;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis of Miltefosine: Integration of Flow Chemistry with Continuous Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating continuous flow synthesis of miltefosine with continuous mechanochemistry is reported for the first time. The total residence time for the four&#8208;step sequence is 34&#8197;minutes, which is significantly shorter than the reported traditional batch protocol (&gt;15&#8197;h). This approach facilitates continuous synthesis of the final product at a scale of 10&#8197;g/hr, which is sufficient to treat 4800 patients per day.







Abstract
Herein we report for the first time, an advanced continuous flow synthesis of the blockbuster Leishmaniasis drug miltefosine from simple starting materials by a sequence involving four steps of chemical transformation including a continuous mechanochemical step. First three reaction steps were performed in simple tubular reactors in a telescopic mode, while in the last step the product precipitated from the 3rd step was used for a continuous mechanochemical synthesis of miltefosine. When compared to a typical batch protocol that takes 15&#8197;h, miltefosine was obtained in 58&#8201;% overall yield in flow synthesis mode at the laboratory scale in a total residence time 34&#8197;min at synthesis rate of 10&#8197;g/hr, which is sufficient to treat 4800 patients per day.

         <dc:description>
Compared to all previously known silanols, perfluorinated tris(tert&#8208;butoxy)silanol has dramatically increased Br&#248;nsted acidity. It can be easily deprotonated by amines and pyridines, as indicated by the purple &#8220;dissolving proton&#8221;. The town musicians and the key are symbols of Bremen, the German city where the research was conducted. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Ketkov, S. Grabowsky, E. Hupf, J.

         <title>Full&#8208;Atom Model of the Agonist LPS&#8208;Bound Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 Dimer in a Membrane Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational full&#8208;atom models of the agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;bound Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) embedded into a realistic plasma membrane reveal dynamic functional and structural insights of the TLR4 activation and signaling across the membrane, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and dimerization patterns (symmetric and asymmetric) of the intracellular Toll/interleukin&#8208;1 receptor (TIR) domain. These studies unveil molecular aspects of the TLR4, main actor in the innate immune pathways, and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Martin&#8208;Santamaria et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102995).

         <title>Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimeric unnatural prolines can show emergent catalytic properties with respect to their monomeric analogues. When aldol reactions are studied, both monomeric and dimeric organocatalysts behave similarly, the stereocontrol shown by the dimers being additive with respect to their monomeric components. However, the ability of the dimers to promote Michael reactions constitutes a catalytic property not shown by the constituent monomers. This cover represents the emergent catalytic properties of this kind of unnatural &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. More information can be found in the Full Paper by F.&#8197;P. Coss&#237;o et&#8197;al.

         <title>NMR Crystallography Enhanced by Quantum Chemical Calculations and Liquid State NMR Spectroscopy for the Investigation of Se&#8208;NHC Adducts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se adducts of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands were investigated by using 77Se liquid and state solid NMR spectroscopy. The analysis revealed a correlation between the molecular structure of the adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts, but also the other chemical shift tensor components. It was observed that the structural and electronic properties of adducts are different in the solid and liquid states. The discrepancy was interpreted with the help of X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) are widely utilized in catalysis and material science. They are characterized by their steric and electronic properties. Steric properties are usually quantified on the basis of their static structure, which can be determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic properties are estimated in the liquid state; for example, via the 77Se liquid state NMR of Se&#8208;NHC adducts. We demonstrate that 77Se NMR crystallography can contribute to the characterization of the structural and electronic properties of NHC in solid and liquid states. Selected Se&#8208;NHC adducts are investigated via 77Se solid state NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography, supported by quantum chemical calculations. This investigation reveals a correlation between the molecular structure of adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts but also the other chemical shift tensor components. Afterwards, the liquid state 77Se NMR data is presented and interpreted in terms of the quantum chemistry modelling. The discrepancy between the structural and electronic properties, and in particular the &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities of adducts in the solid and liquid states is discussed. Finally, the 13C isotropic chemical shift from the liquid state NMR and the 13C tensor components are also discussed, and compared with their 77Se counterparts. 77Se NMR crystallography can deliver valuable information about NHC ligands, and together with liquid state 77Se NMR can provide an in&#8208;depth outlook on the properties of NHC ligands.

         <title>C&#8211;H Arylation of Benzene with Aryl Halides using H2 and a Water&#8208;Soluble Rh&#8208;Based Electron Storage Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four requirements: 1) H2&#8208;activation is performed in water, 2) electrons from H2 are stored on the metal (M) center as a low&#8208;valent species, 3) the aryl halide is cleaved by oxidative addition to generate an M&#8722;C bond, and 4) radical transfer occurs due to the M&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
This paper reports the first example of C&#8722;H arylation of benzene under mild conditions, using H2 as an electron source {turnover numbers (TONs)=0.7&#8211;2.0 for 24&#8197;h}. The reaction depends on a Rh&#8208;based electron storage catalyst, and proceeds at room temperature and in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the H2 is inactive during the radical transfer step, greatly reducing unwanted side reactions.

         <title>Stabilization of Dynamic Covalent Architectures by Multivalence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous cleavage of multiple imine bonds is obviously more difficult than breaking a single one. Such enhanced stability results from multivalence.







Abstract
The formation of imine bond is reversible. This feature has been taken advantage of by chemists for accomplishing high yielding self&#8208;assembly. On the other hand, it also jeopardizes the intrinsic stability of these self&#8208;assembled products. However, some recent discoveries demonstrate that some of these imine bond containing molecules could be rather stable or kinetically inert. A deep investigation indicated that such enhanced stability results from, at least partially, multivalence. Such results also inspire chemists to use imine condensation for self&#8208;assembly in water, a solvent that is considered not compatible with imine bond for a long time.

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Exciplexes with Sky&#8208;Blue and Green Circularly Polarized&#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of circularly polarized and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) materials based on a chiral luminescent exciplex strategy is explored based on a chiral donor and different achiral acceptor units. This approach leads to CP&#8208;TADF properties with glum up to 7&#215;10&#8722;3 and straightforward color tuning by playing with the energy level of the achiral acceptor while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.







Abstract
Luminescent exciplexes based on a chiral electron donor and achiral acceptors are reported as a new approach to design circularly polarized (CP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This strategy results in rather high CP luminescence (CPL) values with glum up to 7&#215;10&#8722;3, one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the CPL signal recorded for the chiral donor alone (glum &#8764;7&#215;10&#8722;4). This increase occurs concomitantly with a CPL sign inversion, as a result of the strong charge&#8208;transfer emission character, as experimentally and theoretically rationalized by using a covalent chiral donor&#8208;acceptor model. Interestingly, blue, green&#8208;yellow and red chiral luminescent exciplexes can be obtained by modifying with the electron accepting character of the achiral unit while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Amino Acids in Pharmaceutical Industry: Synthetic Approaches to Aza&#8208;Tryptophan Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review profiles five tailor&#8208;made amino acids, aza&#8208;tryptophan derivatives, which include aza&#8208;substitution in positions 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the aromatic rings of tryptophan. The synthesis, medicinal chemistry and biological properties, and most promising applications of these aza&#8208;tryptophan are discussed.







Abstract
Over the recent years there has been a noticeable upsurge of interest in aza&#8208;analogs of tryptophan which are isosteric to the latter and found numerous applications in medicinal, bioorganic chemistry, and peptide research. In the present review article, five aza&#8208;tryptophan derivatives are profiled, including aza&#8208;substitution in the positions 2, on the five&#8208;membered ring, as well as in positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the six&#8208;membered ring. A detailed and comprehensive literature overview of the synthetic methods for the preparation of these aza&#8208;tryptophans is presented and general facets of the biological properties and most promising applications are discussed.

         <title>Rapid Conversion of a Au9Ag12 into a AuxAg16&#8208;x Nanocluster via Bisphosphine Ligand Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via ligand engineering with Dppe, a non&#8208;fluorescent [Au9Ag12(SAdm)4(Dppm)6Cl6](SbF6)3 is reconstructed into a [AuxAg16&#8208;x(SAdm)8(Dppe)2] with aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Furthermore, chiral nanoclusters AuxAg16&#8208;x(SAdm)8(R/S&#8208;Dbpb)2 are obtained with chiral ligand Dbpb. This work provides guidance for the construction of novel clusters by etching clusters with multidentate phosphine ligands.







Abstract
The [AuxAg16&#8208;x(SAdm)8(Dppe)2] nanocluster with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) was synthesized from a non&#8208;fluorescent [Au9Ag12(SAdm)4(Dppm)6Cl6](SbF6)3 nanocluster via a ligand&#8208;exchange engineering (Dppe=1,2&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, Dppm=Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, HSAdm=1&#8208;Adamantanethiol). The nanocluster has a Au&#8208;doped icosahedral AuxAg13&#8208;x core, capped by two Ag(SR)3, one Ag(SR)2 and two Dppe ligands. By changing the achiral Dppe ligand into a chiral dbpb ligand ((2S,3S)&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)butane or (2R,3R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;2,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)butane), chiral nanoclusters are obtained. ESI&#8208;MS and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were performed to track the reaction. This work provides guidance for the construction of new clusters by etching clusters with multidentate phosphine ligands.

         <title>NMR Crystallography Reveals Carbonate Induced Al&#8208;Ordering in ZnAl Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. This study reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO32&#8722; during crystallization of [M2+4M3+2(OH)2]2+[A2&#8722;]1&#8901;yH2O LDH phases.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) serve a score of applications in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH&#8197;8.5, pH&#8197;10.0, pH&#8197;12.5) with a Zn/Al ratio of 2, without subsequent hydrothermal treatment to avoid extensive recrystallisation. In ideal configuration, all Al cations should be part of the LDH and be coordinated with 6 Zn atoms, but NMR revealed two different Al local environments were present in all samples in a ratio dependent on synthesis pH. NMR&#8208;crystallography, integrating NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, succeeded to identify them as Al residing in the highly ordered crystalline phase, next to Al in disordered material. With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased, and the side phase fraction decreased. Using 1H&#8722;13C, 13C&#8722;27Al HETCOR NMR in combination with 27Al MQMAS, 27Al&#8208;DQ&#8208;SQ measurements and Rietveld refinement on high&#8208;resolution PXRD data, the extreme anion exchange selectivity of these LDHs for CO32&#8722; over HCO3&#8722; was linked to strict Al and CO32&#8722;ordering in the crystalline LDH. Even upon equilibration of the LDH in pure NaHCO3 solutions, only CO32&#8722; was adsorbed by the LDH. This reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO32&#8722; during crystallization of [M2+4M3+2(OH)2]2+[A2&#8722;]1&#8901;yH2O LDH phases.

         <dc:description>Relative rates for the Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover&#8208;limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2&#8208;diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects. In absolute terms the first acylation step is found to be up to 35 times faster than the second one for the primary alcohols due to neighboring group effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening of minimalist noncanonical sites in duplex DNA and RNA reveals context and motif&#8208;selective binding by fluorogenic base probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We hypothesize that programmable hybridization to noncanonical nucleic acid motifs may be achieved by macromolecular display of binders to individual noncanonical pairs (NCPs). As each recognition element may individually have weak binding to an NCP, we developed a semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity interactions between selected nitrogenous bases and noncanonical sites in duplex DNA and RNA. A set of fluorogenic probes was synthesized by coupling abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases to thiazole orange (TO) dye. This probe library was screened against duplex nucleic acid substrates bearing single abasic, single NCP and tandem NCP sites. Probe engagement with NCP sites was reported by by 100&#8208;1000X fluorescence enhancement over background. Binding is strongly context&#8208;dependent, reflective of both molecular recognition and stability: less stable motifs are more likely to bind a synthetic probe. Further, DNA and RNA substrates exhibit entirely different abasic and single NCP binding profiles. While probe binding in the abasic and single NCP screens was monotonous, much richer binding profiles were observed with the screen of tandem NCP sites in RNA, in part due to increased steric accessibility. In addition to known binding interactions between the triazine melamine (M) and T/U sites, the NCP screens identified new targeting elements for pyrimidine&#8208;rich motifs in single NCPs and 2x2 internal bulges. We anticipate that semi&#8208;rational approaches of this type will lead to programmable noncanonical hybridization strategies at the macromolecular level.</dc:description>

A set of fluorogenic probes was synthesized by coupling abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases to thiazole orange (TO) dye. This probe library was screened against duplex nucleic acid substrates bearing single abasic, single NCP and tandem NCP sites. Probe engagement with NCP sites was reported by by 100-1000X fluorescence enhancement over background. Binding is strongly context-dependent, reflective of both molecular recognition and stability: less stable motifs are more likely to bind a synthetic probe. Further, DNA and RNA substrates exhibit entirely different abasic and single NCP binding profiles. While probe binding in the abasic and single NCP screens was monotonous, much richer binding profiles were observed with the screen of tandem NCP sites in RNA, in part due to increased steric accessibility. In addition to known binding interactions between the triazine melamine (M) and T/U sites, the NCP screens identified new targeting elements for pyrimidine-rich motifs in single NCPs and 2x2 internal bulges. We anticipate that semi-rational approaches of this type will lead to programmable noncanonical hybridization strategies at the macromolecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence for Catalytic Stereoselective Semireduction of Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence has been developed for catalytic semireduction of allenamides with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereocontrol. This system also provides an example of catalytic regiodivergent semireduction of allenes for the first time. The divergence of the semireduction is enabled by ligand switch with the same palladium pre&#8208;catalyst under operationally simple and mild conditions. Monodentate ligand XPhos exclusively promotes selective 1,2&#8208;semireduction to afford allylic amides, while bidentate ligand BINAP completely switched the regioselectivity to 2,3&#8208;semireduction, producing (E)&#8208;enamide derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Tolerant Sulfate Tetrahedral Cages from Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular cages have been constructed by anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) in recent years and shown unique host&#8208;guest interactions. However, most of the reported cages are made of phosphate ion (PO43&#8722;), while other anions have rarely been explored. Here we show for the first time that sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) is also able to form the A4L4 tetrahedral motif with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, but this is dependent on the stoichiometry of sulfate ion (in solution). Notably, the sulfate cages display enhanced resistance for both Br&#248;nsted (pH as low as 4.3 in acetone containing 15% water) and Lewis acids (metal complexes) than the corresponding phosphate cages, and thus may find applications where acidic (proton or metals) environment is required.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Free Access to Polysubstituted Pyrimidines via Nitrile Activation and [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitriles were activated in presence of Tf2O into aza&#8208;allene species followed by an intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This process was evidenced by detailed deuteration experiments and competing reactions. A bidentate pyrimidine ligand was synthesized for preparation of a metal complex with pure blue luminescence at 470&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tf2O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidines and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf2O, aza&#8208;allene species were generated in&#8197;situ through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments. The reaction had good substrate extensibility with moderate to excellent yield including trimethylsilylalkynes. The method was utilized as a synthetic tool in the preparation of a luminescent metal complex.

         <dc:description>A dimethyldihydropyrene (DHP) photochromic unit has been functionalized by donor (triphenylamine group) and acceptor (methyl&#8208;pyridinium) substituents. This compound was characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies as well as cyclic voltammetry and its properties were rationalized by theoretical calculations. The incorporation of both electron donor and withdrawing groups on the photochromic center allows  i)  an efficient photo&#8208;isomerization of the system when illuminated at low energy (quantum yield: &#1060;  c&#8208;o  = 13.3% at &#955;  ex.  = 660 nm),  ii)  the reversible and quantitative formation of two endoperoxyde isomers when illuminated under aerobic conditions at room temperature and  iii)  the storage and production of singlet oxygen.

         <title>Efficient Hydro&#8208; and Organogelation by Minimalistic Diketopiperazines Containing a Highly Insoluble Aggregation&#8208;Induced, Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission Luminophore**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimalistic and highly efficient hydro&#8208; and organogelators were obtained by the combination of a highly insoluble luminophore capable of aggregation&#8208;induced blue shifted emission (AIBSE) with natural amino&#8208;acid derived diketopiperazines. The gelators were investigated with regard to their aggregation and gelation behavior, and their photophysical and material properties. The modular approach demonstrates a potent strategy to turn an otherwise poorly soluble polycyclic aromatic compound into hydro&#8208; and organogelators.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, gelation abilities and aggregation&#8208;induced, blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE) properties of two minimalistic diketopiperazine&#8208;based gelators. Despite containing a highly insoluble luminophore that makes up more than half of their respective molecular masses, efficient hydrogelation by multiple stimuli for one and efficient organogelation for the other compound are reported. Insights into the aggregation and gelation properties were gained through examination of the photophysical and material properties of selected gels, which are representative of the different modes of gelation. The synthesis of the gelators is highly modular and based on readily available amino acid building blocks, allowing the efficient and rapid diversification of these core structures and fine&#8208;tuning of gel properties.

         <title>The Roles of Composition and Mesostructure of Cobalt&#8208;Based Spinel Catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The particle anisotropy and cobalt content in spinel oxides is systematically varied and the impact on oxygen evolving reactions is investigated. For chemical and electrochemical water oxidation as well as H2O2 decomposition the reactivity changes with the cobalt&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio and the degree of anisotropy. Furthermore, the importance of the interplay of redox pairs and different active sites are highlighted.







Abstract
By using the crystalline precursor decomposition approach and direct co&#8208;precipitation the composition and mesostructure of cobalt&#8208;based spinels can be controlled. A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox&#8208;active iron and redox&#8208;inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co3O4, MgCo2O4, Co2FeO4, Co2AlO4 and CoFe2O4. The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation by using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H2O2 decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co3O4 and CoFe2O4 catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogues. For CAN&#8208;test and OER, Co3+ plays the major role for high activity. In H2O2 decomposition, Co2+ reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions. A benefit of a predominant 111 surface termination depends on the cobalt oxidation state in the as&#8208;prepared catalysts and the investigated reaction.

         <title>Fast Detection of Entacapone by a Lanthanide&#8211;Organic Framework with Rhombic Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide&#8208;organic framework was synthesized to detect entacapone by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect.







Abstract
Entacapone (ENT) is a powerful catechol&#8208;O&#8208;methyl transferase inhibitor that is used for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's syndrome, but the amount used must be well controlled to avoid overtreatment and side effect. Fast and selective detection of ENT needs well&#8208;matched energy levels and well&#8208;designed sensor&#8208;ENT interaction which is highly challenging. In this work, a water stable europium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Eu&#8208;TDA) was synthesized to detect ENT by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity in the presence of main coexisting and interference species of plasma with a limit of detection of 5.01&#8197;&#956;M. The experimental results showed that the luminescence of Eu&#8208;TDA can be effectively quenched by ENT via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect mechanism in the system.

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring, ring! The reactivity of spiro&#8208;activated electrophilic cyclopropanes was studied by following the kinetics of their SN2&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening reactions with thiophenolate ions in DMSO at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The experimentally determined second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) correlated linearly with Mayr nucleophilicities N, basicities (pKaH), and Hammett substituent constants of the thiophenolates, but parabolic Hammett plots revealed variable electrophile&#8208;dependent effects on the stabilization of the transition states.







Abstract
The kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reactions of thiophenolates with geminal bis(acceptor)&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in DMSO at 20&#8201;&#176;C was monitored by photometric methods. The determined second&#8208;order rate constants of the SN2 reactions followed linear relationships with Mayr nucleophilicity parameters (N/sN) and Br&#248;nsted basicities (pKaH) of the thiophenolates as well as with Hammett substituent parameters (&#963;) for groups attached to the thiophenolates. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted by up to a factor of 15 faster than their unsubstituted analogues, in accord with the known activating effect of adjacent &#960;&#8208;systems in SN2 reactions. Variation of the electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, the inherent SN2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;systems because of the more advanced C1&#8722;C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems also lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially&#8208;chiral atropisomeric compounds are widely applied in asymmetric catalysis and medicinal chemistry. In particular, axially chiral indole&#8208; and indoline&#8208;based frameworks have been recognised as important heterobiaryl classes because they are the core units of bioactive natural alkaloids, chiral ligands and bioactive compounds. Among them, the synthesis of C7&#8208;substituted indole biaryls and the analogous indoline derivatives is particularly challenging, and methods for their efficient synthesis are in high demand. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is considered one of the most efficient methods to construct atropisomers. Here we report the enantioselective synthesis of C7&#8208;indolino&#8208; and C7&#8208;indolo biaryl atropisomers by means of C&#8211;H functionalisation catalysed by chiral RhJasCp complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Reduction of MoO3&#160;to MoO2: A Path to Control the Particle Size and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the reduction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO  3  ) to metallic molybdenum, the first reduction step yielding molybdenum dioxide as an intermediary product is of crucial importance. In this study, we examined the impact of the parameters reduction temperature, water influx, and potassium content on the hydrogen reduction of this first reaction step. Beginning from the same starting material the chemical vapor transport mechanism was utilized to yield the phase pure MoO  2  . Analyses including powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and high performance optical microscopy were performed on the product phases. Modulations of the specific surface areas of molybdenum dioxide ranging from 2.28 to 0.41 m  2  /g were possible. Furthermore, a distinct shift from small plate&#8208;like grains to cuboid&#8208;like forms was achieved.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rh(I) NHC and Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, NHC =  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene = pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Py&#8208;Im), thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are presented. Selected catalysts were selectively immobilized inside the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15 having average pore diameters of 5.0 and 6.2 nm, respectively. Together with their homogenous progenitors, the immobilized catalysts were used in the hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes. For aromatic alkynes, both the neutral and cationic Rh(I) complexes showed excellent reactivity with exclusive formation of the &#946;(  E  )&#8208;isomer. For aliphatic alkynes, however, selectivity of the Rh(I) complexes was low. By contrast, the neutral and cationic Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes proved to be highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalysts, allowing for the formation of the thermodynamically less stable &#946;&#8208;(  Z  )&#8208;vinylsilane isomers at room temperature. Notably, the SBA&#8208;15 immobilized Rh(I) catalysts, in which the pore walls provide an additional confinement, showed excellent &#946;&#8208;(  Z  )&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of aliphatic alkynes, too. Also, in the case of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene, selective formation of the &#946;(  Z  )&#8208;isomer was observed with a neutral SBA&#8208;15 supported Rh(III) Cp* NHC complex but not with its homogenous counterpart. These are the first examples of high &#946;(  Z  )&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of alkynes by confinement generated upon immobilization inside mesoporous silica.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage amination of drug&#8208;like benzoic acids: Access to anilines and drug conjugates via directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with a potential to streamline the drug discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The herein presented method enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed for the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug delivery conjugates, PROTACs, as well as probes for chemical biology. The rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid, and considerably accelerate, drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Methane Activation by (MoO3)5O&#8722; Cluster Anions: The Importance of Orbital Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the molybdenum oxide cluster anion (MoO 3 ) 5 O &#8722; , bearing an unpaired electron at a bridging oxygen atom (O b &#8226;&#8722; ), towards methane under thermal collision conditions has been studied by mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations. This reaction follows the mechanism of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and is facilitated by the O b &#8226;&#8722; radical center. The reactivity of (MoO 3 ) 5 O &#8722; can be traced back to the appropriate orientation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) that is essentially the 2p orbital of the O b &#8226;&#8722; atom. This study not only makes up the blank of thermal methane activation by the O b &#8226;&#8722; radical on negatively charged clusters but also yields new insights into methane activation by the atomic oxygen radical anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Activity of Supported Metal Nanoparticles and Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis has been known as one of the promising technologies due to its eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, the potential application of many photocatalysts is limited owing to their large bandgaps and inefficient use of the solar spectrum. One strategy to overcome this problem is to combine the advantages of heteroatom&#8208;containing supports with active metal centres to accurately adjust the structural parameters. Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) are excellent candidates due to their distinctive coordination environment which enhances photocatalytic activity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and carbon nitride (g&#8208;C  3  N  4  ) have shown great potential as catalyst support for SACs and MNPs. The numerous combinations of organic linkers with various heteroatoms and metal ions provide unique structural characteristics to achieve advanced materials. This review describes the recent advancement of the modified MOFs, COFs and g&#8208;C  3  N  4  with SACs and NPs for enhanced photocatalytic applications with emphasis on environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple regulation effects of ammonium acetate on ZnO growth process in chemical bath deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical bath deposition method has been used to synthesize a variety of ZnO morphology structures. However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO  3  )  2  &#8208;HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn  2+  &#8208;layered basic zinc salta(LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped, rod&#8208;shaped to a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand&#8208;ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn&#8208;rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve&#8208;renucleation&#8208;regrowth process which retains the twin&#8208;shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at ~10 mM ammonium acetate. Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) measurements show that the uniform hexagonal ZnO rods (Y&#8208;10, the sample named as Y&#8208;x (x represents x mM ammonium acetate, herein, x is 10 mM)) have a maximum photocurrent density of 1.54 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), much higher than that of the dumbbell&#8208;shaped ZnO rods (Y&#8208;50, 0.20 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) at the same voltage. These results provide a further explanation of morphology regulation mechanisms on ZnO synthesis processes and pave the road for more practical applications.</dc:description>

However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO  3  )  2  -HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn  2+  -layered basic zinc salta(LBZs)-ZnO process, while the self-assembled unit changed from urchin-shaped, rod-shaped to a fully coupled twin-shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand-ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn-rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve-renucleation-regrowth process which retains the twin-shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at ~10 mM ammonium acetate.

p&#8208;anisyl (1c)) were isolated. The bonding situation was studied by

Density Functional Theory using EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition

Analysis with Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence). The polar Ti&#8208;N

bond in 1a&#8208;c features an unusual inversion of &#963; and &#960; bond strengths

responsible for the balance between stability and reactivity in these

coordinatively unsaturated species. In solution, 1a&#8208;c undergo

photolytic Ti&#8208;N cleavage to release Ti(III) species and aminyl radicals

&#11825;NPhAr. Reaction of 1b with H3BNHMe2 results in fast homolytic Ti&#8208;N

cleavage to give [Cp2Ti(H3BNHMe2)][B(C6F5)4] (3). 1a&#8208;c are highly

active precatalysts in olefin hydrogenation and silanes/amines crossdehydrogenative

coupling, whilst 3 efficiently catalyzes amine&#8208;borane

dehydrogenation. The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation was

studied by DFT and the cooperative H2 activation key step was

disclosed using the Activation Strain Model (ASM).</dc:description>

         <title>A New Nonlinear Optical Material with&#160;N(CN)2&#8208; Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovering new functional genes and developing high&#8208;performance materials are the goals being pursued by scientists. In this work, we successfully obtained a second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) material via the aqueous solution method, Y[N(CN)  2  ]  4  [NH(C  2  H  5  )  3  ]&#8729;3H  2  O, which is the first NLO material with anionic group N(CN)  2  &#8208;  . Remarkably, this material not only is strongly NLO&#8208;active at 1064 nm with a response of about 2.8 &#215; KH  2  PO  4  , but also possesses a short UV absorption edge of 250 nm. In&#8208;depth first&#8208;principles calculations well illustrate that the optical properties are mainly from the strong interaction of N, C and Y atoms. This result indicates that the N(CN)  2  &#8722;  anion may be a new NLO functional gene. This work enriches the diversity of NLO functional genes and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging&#160;of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum mechanical framework&#160;that enables a combination of ideas from&#160;three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA), Quantum Chemical Topology, and Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one&#8208;part electrons and one&#8208;part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. Formation of polar bonds are predicted to cause inversions of electronegativity and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8208;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. Electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of&#160;pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Molecular O2 on CoFe2O4&#160;(001) Surfaces: An Embedded Cluster Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dioxygen activation pathways on the (001) surfaces of cobalt ferrite, CoFe  2  O  4  , were investigated computationally using density functional theory and the hybrid Perdew&#8211;Burke&#8211;Ernzerhof exchange&#8208;correlation functional (PBE0) within the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. We considered two terminations: the A&#8208;layer exposing Fe  2+  and Co  2+  metal sites in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, and the B&#8208;layer exposing octahedrally coordinated Co  3+  . On the A&#8208;layer, molecular oxygen is chemisorbed as a superoxide on the Fe monocenter or bridging a Fe&#8208;Co cation pair, whereas on the B&#8208;layer it is adsorbed at the most stable anionic vacancy. Activation is promoted by transfer of electrons provided by the  d  metal centers onto the adsorbed oxygen. The subsequent dissociation of dioxygen into monoatomic species and surface reoxidation have been identified as the most critical steps that may limit the rate of the oxidation processes. Of the reactive metal&#8208;O species, [Fe  III  &#8208;O]  2+  is thermodynamically most stable, while the oxygen of the Co&#8208;O species may easily migrate across the A&#8208;layer with barriers smaller than the associative desorption.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have invented a new route to synthesis of various mono N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides by involving in a new C&#8208;N bond formation using N&#8208;amino&#8208;&#8203;1,&#8203;8&#8208;&#8203;naphthalimide&#160;as a regenerated precursor. Aniline&#160;and phenylhydrazines &#160;are reproduced upon reacting these individually with 1,8&#8208;naphthalic anhydride&#160;followed by hydrazinolysis. The practicality and simplicity of this C&#8211;N bond formation protocol was exemplified to various hydrazines and hydrazides. N&#8208;amino&#8208;&#8203;1,&#8203;8&#8208;&#8203;naphthalimide&#160;is suitable synthon for transformation for selective formation of mono substituted hydrazine and hydrazide derivatives.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have invented a new route to synthesis of various mono N-substituted hydrazines and hydrazides by involving in a new C-N bond formation using N-amino-&#8203;1,&#8203;8-&#8203;naphthalimide&#160;as a regenerated precursor. Aniline&#160;and phenylhydrazines &#160;are reproduced upon reacting these individually with 1,8-naphthalic anhydride&#160;followed by hydrazinolysis. The practicality and simplicity of this C&#8211;N bond formation protocol was exemplified to various hydrazines and hydrazides. N-amino-&#8203;1,&#8203;8-&#8203;naphthalimide&#160;is suitable synthon for transformation for selective formation of mono substituted hydrazine and hydrazide derivatives. Those are selective mono amidation of hydrazine with acid halides; mono N-substituted alkylidene hydrazine from aldehydes; synthesis of N-aminoazacycloalkanes from dihalo alkanes; developed a synthon for acetohydrazide scaffold and inserted to hydroxy derivatives; distinct synthesis of N,N-dibenzylhydrazines and N-benzylhydrazines from benzyl halides; synthesis of N-amino-amino acids from &#945;-halo esters. Ecofriendly reagent N-amino-&#8203;1,&#8203;8-&#8203;naphthalimide&#160;was regenerated with good yields by the hydrazinolysis in all procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total syntheses of conjugation&#8208;ready repeating units of Acinetobacter baumannii AB5075 for glycoconjugate vaccine development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acinetobacter baumannii  is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious nosocomial infections. One of the multidrug&#8208;resistant strains, AB5075, can result in bacteremia, pneumonia and wound infections associated with high morbidity and mortality. The structurally unique glycans on the surface of these bacteria are attractive targets for the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. Here, we report the first total synthesis of the densely functionalized trisaccharide repeating unit of  A. baumannii  AB5075 as well as two analogues. The construction of 1,2&#8208;  cis  linkages between the rare sugars relies on a double&#8208;serial inversion strategy. The judicious selection of building blocks and reaction conditions allowed for stereoselective glycosylations, the installation of acetamido groups and the (  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Azimuthal Dipolar Rotor Arrays on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of dipolar molecular rotor compounds was designed, synthesized and adsorbed as self&#8208;assembled 2D arrays on Ag(111) surfaces. The title molecules are constructed from three building blocks: (a) 4,8,12&#8208;trioxatriangulene (TOTA) platforms that are known to physisorb on metal surfaces such as Au(111) and Ag(111), (b) phenyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that function as pivot joints to reduce the barrier to rotation, (c) pyridine and pyridazine units as small dipolar units on top. Theoretical calculations and STM investigations hint at the fact that the dipoles of neighbouring rotors interact through space via pairs of energetically favourable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay of Polarity and Confinement in Asymmetric Catalysis with Chiral Rh Diene Complexes in Microemulsions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microemulsions provide a unique opportunity to tailor the polarity and liquid confinement in asymmetric catalysis via nanoscale polar and nonpolar domains separated by a surfactant film. For chiral diene Rh complexes, the influence of counterion and surfactant film on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity remained elusive. To explore this issue chiral norbornadiene Rh(X) complexes (X = OTf, OTs, OAc, PO  2  F  2  ) were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. These complexes were used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to  N&#8208;  tosylimine in microemulsions stabilized either exclusively by  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;  &#223;  &#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (C  8  G  1  ) or a C  8  G  1  &#8208;film doped with anionic or cationic surfactants (AOT, SDS and DTAB). The Rh(OAc) complex showed the largest dependence on the composition of the microemulsion, yielding up to 59&#160;%&#160;(90&#160;%ee) for the surfactant film doped with 5&#160;wt.% of AOT as compared to 52&#160;% (58&#160;%ee) for neat C  8  G  1  at constant surfactant concentration. The larger domains, determined by SAXS analysis, enabled an increase in yield and selectivity while the reaction rate almost remained constant according to kinetic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ  observation of  ferroelastic domain and phase transition in a three&#8208;dimensional molecular crystal.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Massive efforts have been devoted to designing molecular ferroic materials by molecular modification. For molecular ferroelastic, previous work is focused on the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelastic domains, however, few are related to controlling the ferroelastic domain by the stress. Inspired by the &#8220;quasi&#8208;spherical theory&#8221; and fluorination effect, we designed a more flexible (MedabcoF)  2+  (MedabcoF= 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) cation by introducing a methyl group and a fluorine atom at the two symmetrical ends of the Dabco (1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and synthesized a hybrid 3D perovskite (MedabcoF)Rb(BF  4  )  3  (1) which displays three reversible phase transitions accompanying dual ferroelastic behavior. Besides, it not only exhibits ferroelastic domains switching by the thermal stimulation, and the sensitive reaction of in situ domains under the stress of it is also realized. This work not only achieves a force&#8208;controlled ferroelastic domain but develops a more profound comprehension of the relationship between the thermal motion behavior of guest cations and the intriguing properties of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Access to Cyanated N&#8208;Heterocycles via Direct Flow&#8208;Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitriles are recurring motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile functional groups in synthetic chemistry. Despite recent progress, direct introduction of a nitrile moiety in heteroarenes remains challenging. Recent developments in electrochemical reactions pave the way to more practical cyanation protocols. However, currently available methods typically require hazardous cyanide sources, expensive mediators, and often suffer from narrow substrate scope and laborious reaction set&#8208;up. To address the limitations of current synthetic methods, we report here an effective, sustainable, and scalable procedure for the direct C(  sp  2  )&#8208;H cyanation of aromatic  N  &#8208;heterocycles with a user&#8208;friendly flow&#8208;electrochemical set&#8208;up. Furthermore, high substrate and functional group tolerance is demonstrated, allowing for late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug&#8208;like scaffolds such as natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel route for the easy production of thermochromic VO2 nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a simple, fast and dry method for the fabrication of a thermochromic product with a high load of VO  2  &#160;(M1) consisting of the controlled heat treatment of pure vanadium nanoparticles in air is presented. After a complete design of experiments, it is concluded that the most&#160;direct way to attain the maximum transformation of V into VO  2  (M1) consists of one cycle with a fast heating ramp of 42  o  Cs  &#8722;1  , followed by keeping 700  o  C for 530&#8208;600 seconds, and a subsequent cooling at 0.05  o  Cs  &#8722;1  . Careful examination of these results lead to a second optimum, even more suitable for industrial production (quicker and less energy&#8208;intensive because of its lower temperatures and shorter times), consisting of subjecting V to two consecutive cycles of temperatures and times (625  o  C for 5 minutes) with similar preheating&#160;but a much faster postcooling (~8  o  Cs  &#8722;1  ). These green reactions only use the power for heating a tube open to atmosphere and a vanadium precursor; without assistance of reactive gases or catalysts, and no special vacuum or pressure requirements. The best products present similar thermochromic properties but higher thermal stability than commercial VO  2  particles. These&#160;methods can be combined with VO  2  doping.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, a simple, fast and dry method for the fabrication of a thermochromic product with a high load of VO  2  &#160;(M1) consisting of the controlled heat treatment of pure vanadium nanoparticles in air is presented. After a complete design of experiments, it is concluded that the most&#160;direct way to attain the maximum transformation of V into VO  2  (M1) consists of one cycle with a fast heating ramp of 42  o  Cs  &#8722;1  , followed by keeping 700  o  C for 530-600 seconds, and a subsequent cooling at 0.05  o  Cs  &#8722;1  . Careful examination of these results lead to a second optimum, even more suitable for industrial production (quicker and less energy-intensive because of its lower temperatures and shorter times), consisting of subjecting V to two consecutive cycles of temperatures and times (625  o  C for 5 minutes) with similar preheating&#160;but a much faster postcooling (~8  o  Cs  &#8722;1  ). These green reactions only use the power for heating a tube open to atmosphere and a vanadium precursor; without assistance of reactive gases or catalysts, and no special vacuum or pressure requirements. The best products present similar thermochromic properties but higher thermal stability than commercial VO  2  particles. These&#160;methods can be combined with VO  2  doping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Putting anion&#8208;&#960; interactions at work for catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its discovery two decades ago, anion&#8211;&#960; interaction has been increasingly recognized as an important driving force. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts on the ground&#8208;state anion&#8211;&#960; binding and recognition have laid the bases for exploring its relevance in catalysis. Accordingly, the concept of &#8220;anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis&#8221; that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface (&#960;&#8208;acidic surface) for anionic reaction intermediate and transition state stabilization has emerged. This article shortly illustrates the emergence and development of this concept, aiming to provide an emphasis on the general concept and key progress in this exciting area. To highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8211;&#960; interactions, the contents are organized according to their role engaged in catalytic process, e.g. from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, mainly by a single &#960;&#8208;face, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation. A concluding remark and outlook on future development of this field is also given.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN peptide complexes increases ROS levels, DNA cleavage and antiproliferative activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the a &#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2 &#8594; &#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production ( . OH and H 2 O 2 ). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC 50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium Indenyl NHC and Fluorenyl&#8208;Tethered&#8208;NHC Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Applications in the Catalytic C&#8208;H Borylation of Arenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indenyl&#160;rhodium NHC complexes [Rh(&#951;5&#8208;Ind)(NHC)(L)] were synthesised for SIPr&#160;with L = C2H4  (1), CO (2a) and COE (3), for SIMes&#160;with L = CO (2b) and COE (4), and IMes&#160;with L = CO (2c) and COE (5). Reaction of SIPr with [Rh(Cp*)(C2H4)2] did not give the desired SIPr complex demonstrating the &#8216;indenyl effect&#8217; in the synthesis of  1  . Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3  to  3  proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6).&#160;Tethered&#8208;fluorenyl&#8208;NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5&#8208;C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4  :  11, L=COE:  12  , L=CO:  13; R=Mes, L=COE:  14  , L=CO:  15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE:  16  , L=CO:  17) were also synthesised.  3  and  1  were the best catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene using B2pin2  (97% and 93% PhBpin respectively with 5 mol% catalyst, 24 hr, 80&#176;C), with SIPr a better ligand than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl&#8208;tethered&#8208;NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2  at 120&#176;C and 140&#176;C respectively showed high conversions by NMR spectroscopy&#160;into octyl and decylBpin over 4 &#8211; 7 days demonstrating catalysed sp3  C&#8208;H borylation. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420 nm light confirmed the dissociation of alkene&#160;ligands whereas CO complexes were inert. Evidence for C&#8208;H bond activation in the alkyl groups of the NHC ligands was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Phosphoryl pyrazolones for highly selective lithium separation from alkali metal ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective receptors for the separation of Li + from a mixture with other alkali metal ions under mild conditions remains an important challenge that could benefit from new approaches. In this study, it is demonstrated that the 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones, H  L  2  &#8208;H  L  4  , in the presence of the typical industrial organophosphorus co&#8208;ligands tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), tributylphosphate (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), are able to selectively recognise and extract lithium ions from aqueous solution. Structural investigations in solution as well as in the solid state reveal the existence of a series of multinuclear Li  +  complexes that include dimers (TBPO, TBP) as well as rarely observed trimers (TOPO) and represent the first clear evidence for the synergistic role of the co&#8208;ligands in the extraction process. Our findings are supported by detailed NMR, MS and extraction studies. Liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in the presence of TOPO revealed an unprecedented high Li  +  extraction efficiency (78%) for H  L  4  compared to the use of the industrially employed acylpyrazolone H  L  1  (15%) and benzoyl&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroacetone (52%) extractants. In addition, a high selectivity for Li  +  over Na  +  , K  +  and Cs  +  under mild conditions (pH ~ 8.2) confirms that H  L  2  &#8208;H  L  4  represent a class of ligands that are very effective extractants for use in lithium separation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lead Mixed Halide with Three Different Coordinated Anions and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are widely applied in information technology, micro&#8208;manufacturing and medical treatment. Herein, a new lead mixed halide with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 represents the rare NLO crystal featuring that three different anions (I&#8208;, Br&#8208; and O2&#8208;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom to form a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron with a large polarizability. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 not only exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching SHG response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), but also possesses a large birefringence (0.27@1064nm) and high laser damage threshold (LDT). The strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains. This study points out an effective strategy to develop new NLO crystals with strong SHG response.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Iron Doping and Cyano Groups for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production over C3N4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the insufficient  carrier separation  dynamics is still of significant in  carbon  nitride (C  3  N  4  )  research  . Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the  synergistic enhancement  effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group&#8208;containing Fe&#8208;doped C  3  N  4  porous materials via direct co&#8208;calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine  for  synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation  of cyano groups and form Fe&#8208;doping  in C  3  N  4  , thereby increasing the visible&#8208;light absorption and reactive sites.  Further, the internal donor&#8208;acceptor  system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e  &#8208;  &#8208;h  +  pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C  3  N  4  (BCN).</dc:description>

         <title>Difluorocarbene&#8208;Induced Ring&#8208;Opening Difluoromethylation&#8208;Halogenation of Cyclic (Thio)Ethers with TMSCF2X (X = Br, Cl)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic(thio)ethers is reported via a simple strategy relying on carbon&#8208;chalcogen bond activation with difluorocarbene. The reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ protonation of the previously little&#8208;known difluoromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylide intermediate followed by ring&#8208;opening with halide ion to afford halogenated acyclic difluoromethyl (thio)ethers that can then be employed for further elaboration. TMSCF2X (X = Br, Cl) are unique reagents to achieve this synthetic purpose, which serve as both the difluorocarbene source and the halide ion source.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of bis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I/III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a systematic study of halogenate(I/III) anions with polyatomic ligands. The bis(perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I) [X(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  , X = Cl, Br, I, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are prepared as their tetraethylammonium salts and characterized with IR, Raman and NMR spectroscopic methods as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Spectroscopical data are supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Additionally, the bonding situation of the species in question are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, we studied the oxidation to the corresponding halogenate(III) derivatives. For [Br(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  oxidation with elemental fluorine yielded [BrF  2  (OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  . Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC  4  F  9  to the I  III  species [I(OC  4  F  9  )  4  ]  &#8722;  which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future. For [Cl(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  the decomposition products of the synthetic approaches towards a chlorine(III) system were analyzed.</dc:description>
