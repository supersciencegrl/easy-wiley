         <title>Doubly Linked Azulene Dimer: A Novel Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of perylene described as a doubly linked azulene dimer has been successfully synthesized. This compound exhibits not only the reversible redox behaviors and p&#8208;type semiconductivity but also one of the narrowest values of the optical band gap among the hitherto reported non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1&#8208;Ph) by the nickel&#8208;mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;biazulene derivative (2). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1&#8208;Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720&#8197;nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed&#8208;shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1&#8208;Ph is calculated to be 0.72&#8197;eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air&#8208;stable non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin&#8208;film of 1&#8208;Ph serves as a p&#8208;type semiconductor. Our study offers fundamental insights into not only the aromaticity with the nonalternant topologies of 1&#8208;Ph but also its potential application in novel organic electronics.

         <title>Physicochemical Properties of New Ionic Liquids and Plastic Crystal Based on Huckel Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve optimal properties in organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and ionic liquids (ILs), new cations and anions must be investigated. A novel series of ILs and OIPC based on Huckel&#8208;type anions were synthesised and characterised.







Abstract
There is increasing interest in ionic liquid electrolytes for battery applications due to their potential as safer alternatives to conventional liquid electrolytes. By carefully selecting cations and anions, the physicochemical properties of these salts can be optimised. However, investigation of new cations and anions is still required to achieve the desired electrolyte properties such as high conductivity, electrochemical stability and low corrosivity. Thus, here a new series of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and an organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) were synthesized and characterized based on N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methylpyrrolidinium ([C2mpyr]+) and N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methyloxazolidinium ([C2moxa]+) cations, paired with 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazolide ([TDI]&#8722;) and 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoroethyl)imidazolide ([PDI]&#8722;) anions, forming [C2mpyr][TDI] (OIPC), [C2mpyr][PDI] (IL), [C2moxa][TDI] (IL), and [C2moxa][PDI] (IL). Thermal properties were analysed using DSC and TGA. The plastic phase of the OIPC [C2mpyr][TDI] is wide and spans most electrolyte application temperatures, extending from &#8722;40&#8197;to&#8197;56&#8201;&#176;C. All salts exhibit thermal stability above 200&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature dependence of the transport properties (viscosity, ionic conductivity, self&#8208;diffusion coefficient) were measured and fitted by the Vogel&#8208;Fulcher&#8208;Tamman (VFT) equation, and the ionicity of the ILs is reported. The electrochemical stability windows of the salts were analysed by CV, and the [C2mpyr]+ cation&#8208;based ILs showed the widest window of ~5&#8201;V.

         <title>Cucurbit[8]Uril&#8208;Stabilized Charge Transfer: An Efficient Supramolecular Approach Toward a Heterogeneous Organic Photocatalyst for Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest complexes of cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) with viologen derivatives in aqueous solution could be switched by the substituted electron donor moieties, where the host&#8208;guest complexes exhibited effective HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex as heterogeneous catalysts has the stronger ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2) in organic solvents.







Abstract
Host&#8208;stabilized charge transfer (HSCT) has been widely utilized in macrocycle&#8208;derived supramolecular assemblies and architectures. However, there has been less research attention focused on the direct fabrication of pure organic photocatalysts using HSCT. Herein, four viologen derivatives (m&#8208;PV2+, m&#8208;BPV2+, d&#8208;PV2+, and d&#8208;BPV2+) with different electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures were synthesized. Their host&#8208;guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) in an aqueous solution could be switched using the substituted electron donor moieties, in which the host&#8208;guest complexes of m&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] and d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] exhibited HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex had the strongest ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2). This was ascribed to the increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation of d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8], which led to more effective HSCT upon encapsulation by the Q[8] host. Consequently, the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex could be easily employed as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photooxidation reaction of thioether com&#8208;pounds with high selectivity. In particular, d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] was successfully applied to the synthesis of sulfoxide drugs, such as the con&#8208;version of inexpensive Iberverin ($7.0 per gram) to the expensive bioactive inhibitor Iberin ($19500.0 per gram) in high yield (94&#8201;%).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first concept to summarize the programmable control of Ostwald ripening (OR) in nanomaterials and bulk materials, highlighting its role in regulating structural and chemophysical properties. It visually summarizes recent advancements, potential challenges, and future research directions, emphasizing the bright prospects of this approach in material science.







Abstract
During the past decade, enlightened by the better understanding of the mechanism of Ostwald ripening (OR), programmable control of OR process have gained popularity in the fields from nanocrystals to bulk materials in virtue of its important on regulating the structural and chem&#8208;physical properties. In this perspective, we systematically summarize the up&#8208;to date advanced applications of OR process involved in nanomaterials and bulk material properties. The potential challenges and perspectives for further research are highlighted. We envision that such research directions will be a base for future work and have a bright future especially for material science.

         <title>Nitrocyclopropanes as Valuable Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis and Biology: Exploring the Origin of the Nitro Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the synthetic methodologies of the nitro&#8208;substituted Donor&#8208;Acceptor cyclopropanes (NCPs). Particularly from nitroalkenes including the Michael Initiated Ring Closure and the Oxidative Ring Closure of Michael Adducts, from Diazo Compounds bearing Nitro Group, from Nitromethane and its Derivatives; and after Oxidation of Aminocyclopropanes or after Cyclopropanation of Miscellaneous Nitro Compounds. The applications described include their Reduction to Aminocyclopropane Carboxylic Acids or Esters, Ring Opening, and Ring Expansion.







Abstract
Cyclopropane derivatives serve as important building blocks in organic synthesis, due to their three&#8208;membered stretched ring. Nitro&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes (NCPs) represent a special class of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) that contain a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro group as substituent on the cyclopropyl moiety. Due to the versatile nature of the nitro group, which can be converted into other functional azo groups or heterocyclic scaffolds, NCPs are considered important building blocks in the design of complex organic compounds. Herein, the present review is organized in two main sections focused on the synthesis and application of NCPs. The part containing the synthetic methodologies of NCPs has been further divided into distinct sections based mainly on the nature of the starting materials, such as: a) from nitroalkenes, b) from nitro&#8208;bearing diazo compounds, c) from nitroalkanes in combination with alkenes, d) from aminocyclopropanes under oxidative conditions, and e) from various nitro compounds, through miscellaneous processes. In the part concerning the applications and use of NCPs, the categorization includes three main subcategories, concerning their reduction to 1&#8208;aminocyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acids (ACC), the ring opening of NCPs leading to valuable open&#8208;chain heterocycles, and the ring expansion to larger cyclic and heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Principles, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the direct recycling methods for cathode materials derived from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The focus includes the pretreatment processes involved in direct recycling, the degradation mechanisms of various cathode materials, and their corresponding regeneration strategies. Additionally, the future developments and prospects of cathode recycling for lithium&#8208;ion batteries are also discussed.







Abstract
In recent years, lithium&#8208;ion batteries have become an important part of the global transition to green and low&#8208;carbon energy. However, due to the rapidly increasing demand and production of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a large amount of spent batteries that need to be disposed of. The most critical and valuable recycling of spent batteries is the recycling of cathode materials. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are traditional recycling processes aimed at extracting valuable metal elements from cathode materials. However, these methods have several disadvantages, including destruction of the structure of cathode materials, lengthy repair processes, high energy consumption and high environmental pollution. The direct recycling process is a popular repair technology for cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The aim is to restore or upgrade the cathode materials in a non&#8208;destructive manner or convert them into other functional products for secondary use, characterized by a short repair process, high atom utilization, lower costs and lower carbon emissions. This perspective summarizes the current status of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling, with a focus on direct recycling of cathode materials. It describes the pretreatment process, theoretical foundations, direct regeneration strategies and perspectives and provides insights for relevant researchers.

         <title>Fluorescence of Aqueous Assemblies Regulated by Integral Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aqueous assemblies of POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS contain interstitial water that separate NDI chromophores due to the steric hinderance of bulky POSS groups. This integral water is repelled for the assemblies of the analogues with flexible alkyl groups. The assemblies without integral water emit excimer fluorescence, while the integral water quenches the fluorescence POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS assemblies via non&#8208;radiative transition.







Abstract
Water is an integral and functional component for aqueous assemblies of POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS molecules. Water serves not only as a solvent but also as an integral component (interstitial water) in aqueous colloids self&#8208;assembled from POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS (POSS = polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, NDI = naphthalene diimide). The interstitial water confined within these colloids is attributed to the steric hindrance of the bulky POSS groups, which dissipates energy and quenches the fluorescence (FL). Control experiments with NDI molecules bearing less steric side groups (propyl or octyl), namely C3&#8722;NDI&#8208;C3 and C8&#8722;NDI&#8208;C8, confirm this role of water in structural assembly and optical function. This discovery opens new possibilities for the innovation of aqueous materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Antisense DNA&#8208;Camptothecin Amphiphile into Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of an amphiphile consist of hydrophobic camptothecin conjugated to an antisense DNA via GSH&#8208;responsive disulphide linker and its self&#8208;assembly into GSH&#8208;responsive NPs are reported. Simultaneous delivery of hydrophobic camptothecin and cell impermeable antisense DNA into the cancer cell in a GSH&#8208;responsive manner is shown. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Chemo and antisense DNA therapies are two clinically proven and efficient treatment modalities for cancer. However, direct delivery of both chemo and antisense oligonucleotides into the cancerous cells is challenging and hence there is a high demand for the development of new strategies that permit the direct delivery of chemo and antisense therapeutic agents in a targeted fashion. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach for the direct delivery of hydrophobic chemo drug and cell impermeable antisense oligonucleotide into a cancer cell in a targeted fashion. Synthesis of an amphiphile (DNA1&#8208;CPT) consist of hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide (DNA1) via glutathione&#8208;responsive disulphide linker is reported. Self&#8208;assembly of DNA1&#8208;CPT results in the formation of GSH&#8208;responsive NPs with CPT as the hydrophobic core and DNA1 as the hydrophilic shell. Self&#8208;assembled NPs exhibits excellent cellular internalization via endocytosis pathway, and the high concentration of glutathione inside the cancer cells causes the cleavage of disulphide bond of the NPs and trigger the simultaneous release of CPT and DNA1a. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed for the NPs due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.

         <title>Construction of Sub&#8208;Nano Channels of Amino Pillar[6]arene Inspired Biomimetic Porous Roots for Specific Remove of Imazamox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we successfully constructed PES membrane channels by layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly of amino pillar[6]arene. Moreover, the specific recognition of imazamox by amino pillar[6]arene made the membrane capable of specific extraction and removal of mazamox.







Abstract
The root ducts play an important role in the plant's transport of nutrients from the soil. Based on the selective transport characteristics of plant roots, amino pillar[6]arene bionic porous root sub&#8208;nano channel membrane were constructed to remove Imazamox. Imazamox (IM) is an effective imidazolinone herbicide frequently utilized in soybean fields to control a wide range of annual grasses and broad&#8208;leaved weeds. However, it is important to note that while IM is effective in controlling the growth of weeds, its residues can affect the plants that are later planted. Developing a material that can efficiently and selectively remove IM from the environment poses a significant challenge in the realm of agricultural residue removal. A layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly was formed through the reaction of amino pillar[6]arene with terephthalaldehyde using an aldehyde&#8208;amine Schiff&#8208;base reaction. The cavity of amino pillar[6]arenal is used to realize the host&#8208;guest interaction of IM. This enabled the development of a membrane with high selectivity for the extraction and removal of IM. The removal rate is 4.66&#8211;21.91 times higher than that of other pesticide chemicals.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we successfully constructed PES membrane channels by layer-upon-layer covalent assembly of amino pillar[6]arene. Moreover, the specific recognition of imazamox by amino pillar[6]arene made the membrane capable of specific extraction and removal of mazamox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root ducts play an important role in the plant's transport of nutrients from the soil. Based on the selective transport characteristics of plant roots, amino pillar[6]arene bionic porous root sub-nano channel membrane were constructed to remove Imazamox. Imazamox (IM) is an effective imidazolinone herbicide frequently utilized in soybean fields to control a wide range of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds. However, it is important to note that while IM is effective in controlling the growth of weeds, its residues can affect the plants that are later planted. Developing a material that can efficiently and selectively remove IM from the environment poses a significant challenge in the realm of agricultural residue removal. A layer-upon-layer covalent assembly was formed through the reaction of amino pillar[6]arene with terephthalaldehyde using an aldehyde-amine Schiff-base reaction. The cavity of amino pillar[6]arenal is used to realize the host-guest interaction of IM. This enabled the development of a membrane with high selectivity for the extraction and removal of IM. The removal rate is 4.66&#8211;21.91 times higher than that of other pesticide chemicals. The successful development of the highly selective porous root bionic membrane provides a broad prospect for its application and development in agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substitution and Electron Transfer in Diborane&#8208;Quinone Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual reactivity of cationic triflato&#8208;diboranes as Lewis acids and electron donors allows quinone coordination and reduction, accompanied by oxidative B&#8722;B bond cleavage, in the diborane coordination sphere. A detailed evaluation of substitution reactions in the catecholato&#8208;diborane products discloses the importance of a catecholato coordination mode change.







Abstract
The dual reactivity of boron compounds as Lewis acids and electron donors has spurred the development of a metallomimetic chemistry of boron compounds as a topical research theme. In this work we elaborate on the reaction of specially&#8208;designed diborane(4) compounds with quinones, as a prime example showing their dual (metallomimetic) chemistry as a Lewis acid and electron donor. The quinone is first coordinated to the diborane and then reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from the B&#8722;B bond to a quinone &#960;* orbital. A variety of substitution reactions of the catecholate&#8208;diborane reaction product was carried out, leading to new catecholato&#8208;diborane compounds and thereby shedding light on the likely mechanisms. Notably, the results disclose the importance of a facile coordination&#8208;mode change of the catecholato ligand (end&#8208;on to bridging) for substitution reactions and for the diborane&#8208;quinone reactions. The results contribute to the further advancement in the use of diboranes with dual reactivity for substrate binding and reduction.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox&#8208;Active Catholyte Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoxybenzenes (AOB) exhibit unique redox behavior with potential for energy storage systems. In this article, we investigate their electrochemical properties and demonstrate a promising reversible oxidation. However, capacity decay during cycling due to unstable intermediates poses a challenge, necessitating the exploration of stabilization strategies to exploit the full potential of AOBs in energy storage applications.







Abstract
Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen&#8208;substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox&#8208;active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro&#8208;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Apoptosis of Cancer Cells Induced by a Kinase&#8208;Responsive Peptide Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that responds to tyrosine kinase activity and induces selective apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressing tyrosine kinase. The peptide self&#8208;assembled on the ER, reducing fluidity and triggering ER stress. This led to the activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8722;12, and &#8722;9 ultimately activating caspase&#8208;3 and &#8722;7 for apoptosis. In vivo studies confirmed the antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential as an organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapy.







Abstract
Organelle targeting is a useful approach in drug development for cancer therapy. Peptide amphiphiles are good candidates for targeting specific organelles because they can be engineered into a wide range of molecular structures, enabling customization for specific functional needs. We have developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that can respond to tyrosine kinase activity and undergo phosphorylation inside cancer cells. C16&#8208;(EY)3 selectively induced apoptosis in cancer cells that overexpressed tyrosine kinase. The self&#8208;assembly of peptide amphiphiles on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane reduced the ER membrane fluidity and triggered ER stress. The mechanism of the cancer cell death induced by C16&#8208;(EY)3 was shown to involve phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase, ER stress induction, and the subsequent activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8722;12, and &#8722;9, which ultimately triggered apoptosis through the activation of caspase&#8208;3 and &#8722;7. In vivo studies further validated the antitumor efficacy of C16&#8208;(EY)3, as transcutaneous administration of the peptide amphiphile inhibited tumor growth in mice. This study elucidated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the peptide amphiphile, indicating the potential of peptide amphiphiles as organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapeutics and providing a novel strategy for the development of selective and potent anticancer drugs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Long&#8208;Chain Hydrocarbons: Investigating the Asymmetric C&#8722;C Coupling Mechanism on Pd3Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigate the asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling mechanism on Pd3Au catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Using DFT calculations, we identify key intermediates and reaction pathways for C2&#8208;C4 product formation. Our findings highlight the role of asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling in selective synthesis of higher hydrocarbons, providing insights for optimizing catalyst design.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density hydrocarbons is pivotal for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons is both crucial and complex. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the C&#8722;C coupling mechanisms responsible for the formation of C2&#8208;C4 products on Pd3Au catalysts. Our findings highlight the sequential formation of C2&#8722;C1 bonds via asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling as a critical pathway for generating C3 product, which is essential for controlling product selectivity. Detailed analysis of coupling reactions involving CCH2* and CCH3* intermediates with various C1 species indicates that these asymmetric coupling events are energetically favorable and play a decisive role in the selective assembly of carbon atoms into longer hydrocarbon chains. Moreover, we propose a mechanism wherein the asymmetric coupling of C1&#8208;C3 intermediate leads to a diverse array of C4 products. This process underscores the importance of CH2 group coupling with C3 intermediates in forming long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Our work provides valuable insights into optimizing catalyst design for improved selectivity towards higher hydrocarbons in CO2 reduction processes.

         <title>Unusual Caesium Monensinate A: Crystallographic Evidence for the Formation of Dinuclear Coordination Species in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caesium monensinate crystalizes as a dinuclear complex with metal centres entrapped into the hydrophilic cavity of the ligands which also act as bridges. The structure dissociates to the corresponding mononuclear species in methanol. Solution spectroscopic studies combined with molecular dynamics modelling disclose the effect of the solvent polarity on the macrocyclization of the antibiotic and its ability to capture alkali cations in a &#8220;closed&#8221; structure.







Abstract
The polyether ionophore monensin A (MonH), applied as silver monensinate, reacts with caesium cations to form a dinuclear complex [Mon2Cs2] the structure of which has been solved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two Cs+ ions are located in the hydrophilic cage of two ligand anions, achieving coordination number eight. In addition, the metal cations are bridged by two functional groups of monensinate A, completing the inner tenfold coordination sphere. NMR studies show that the dinuclear complex dissociates to its mononuclear counterparts in methanol solutions. Further molecular dynamics theoretical modelling of the interaction of monensinate A with alkali metal ions reveals the effect of solvent polarity on the zipping ability of the ligand. Thus, in methanol, used as an explicit solvent, potassium and rubidium cations fully occupy the cavity of the ligand, whereas the sodium monensinate exists in an &#8220;open&#8221; form, with Na+ ions still interacting with the monodentate carboxylate group. The replacement of methanol by the less polar chloroform induces the folding of monensinate A and the formation of &#8220;closed&#8221; structures with all group 1 metal cations. The obtained data explain the specifics in the behaviour of monensinate A caused by the environment, e.&#8201;g., physical state or solvent.

&lt;p&gt;Caesium monensinate crystalizes as a dinuclear complex with metal centres entrapped into the hydrophilic cavity of the ligands which also act as bridges. The structure dissociates to the corresponding mononuclear species in methanol. Solution spectroscopic studies combined with molecular dynamics modelling disclose the effect of the solvent polarity on the macrocyclization of the antibiotic and its ability to capture alkali cations in a &#8220;closed&#8221; structure.

         <title>Enhanced Homogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in a Binuclear Bio&#8208;Inspired Ni&#8208;Ni Complex Bearing Phenanthroline and Sulfidophenolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binuclear Ni(II) complex that significantly enhances light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution compared to its mononuclear counterparts has been synthesized and fully characterized, achieving up to 9000&#8197;TON with quantum dots as photosensitizers. Studies confirm that the complex maintains its molecular integrity during catalysis, and electrocatalytic analysis suggests that the proximity of two nickel ions facilitates increased catalytic activity







Abstract
The prominence of binuclear, bimetallic catalysts underlines the need for the design and development of diverse bifunctional ligand frameworks that exhibit tunable electronic and structural properties. Such strategies enable metal&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;metal cooperation towards catalytic applications, improve catalytic activity, and are essential for advancing multi&#8208;electron transfers for catalytic application. In this work we present the synthesis, crystal structure, and photocatalytic properties of a binuclear Ni(II) complex, [Ni2(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2] (1). Complex 1 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic system (P&#8208;1) showing extensive intra&#8208; and inter&#8208; non&#8208;coordinated interactions. 1 is employed as a catalyst for light driven hydrogen evolution. Its catalytic efficiency in a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;driven system using fluorescein as photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, reaches TON 2900, threefold the efficiency of the corresponding homoleptic mononuclear complex [Ni(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2]. Efficiency rises up to 9000&#8197;TONs when thioglycolic&#8208;coated CdTe quantum dots are used as photosensitizers in the presence of ascorbic acid at pH&#8197;4.5. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering techniques, and Hg&#8208;poisoning measurements reveal that 1 maintains its molecular structure during catalysis. Electrochemical studies in DMF with TFA as the proton source were also performed for the elucidation of the mechanism of its catalytic action and its stability, suggesting that the proximity of two nickel ions plays a part in the increased catalytic activity, facilitating hydrogen evolution.

         <title>An Aziridine and a 2&#8208;Pyrrolidone with Pyridyl Sidearms as Ligands for Cationic Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation and Hydrogenation of C=C and C&#8801;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl&#8208;tethered aziridine and a 2&#8208;pyrrolidone are shown as two unorthodox phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;free ancillary ligands, whose cationic Rh(I) complexes prove highly effective in hydrosilylating and hydrogenating C=C and C&#8801;C bonds catalytically. The [(pyrrolidone&#8208;Rh]+ is remarkably active even at 10&#8197;ppm concentration.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208; or carbene&#8208;based soft ligands are customarily used in Rh and other late transition metal catalyzed alkene and alkyne hydrosilylation and hydrogenation. We report here an aziridine and a 2&#8208;pyrrolidone with pyridyl sidearms, whose cationic Rh(I) complexes prove as excellent catalysts for hydrosilylating terminal olefins by Et3SiH giving anti&#8208;Markovnikov products selectively. To the best of our knowledge, the [(2&#8208;pyrrolidone)&#8208;Rh]+ seems to be the most active Rh catalyst recording a highest TOF of 24000&#8197;h&#8208;1. It works remarkably (TOF: 714&#8197;h&#8208;1) even at 10&#8197;ppm concentration! Terminal alkynes are hydrosilylated too to give &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes selectively. Both catalysts also hydrogenate alkenes and doubly&#8208;hydrogenate alkynes, both terminal and internal, under ambient and benchtop conditions. But in hydrogenation, the [(aziridine)&#8208;Rh]+ catalyst works better. Both ligands and the Rh catalysts are air&#8208;stable.

         <title>Near&#8208;Neutral pH Sensing by Azoheteroarene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes with thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls that detect pH changes in near&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. They exhibit unique light absorption and notable color changes within a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye.







Abstract
We serendipitously discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes capable of detecting pH variations in near&#8208;neutral solutions. These dyes feature thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls linked to hydroxyphenyl azo groups. They exhibit distinctive light absorption properties in aqueous solutions and show notable color changes in a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye. Both experimental data and quantum calculations suggest a plausible mechanism for their function as pH indicators. Additionally, these azoheteroarene dyes effectively monitor pH in complex environments, and we show their use for detecting the pH change of culture medium containing growing cancer cells.

         <title>Exploring Lead&#8208;Free (Guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 Perovskite&#8208;Type Crystal toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with an Ultralow Detection Limit</title>

We have employed a zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth halogen perovskite to fabricate X&#8208;ray detector, demonstrating notable detection capabilities including high sensitivity and low detection limit.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free bismuth halogen perovskites have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their unique properties of bulk resistivity, significant X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities and diminished ion migration. Herein, using the facile low&#8208;temperature solution method, we obtained a large&#8208;size single crystal of (guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 (GBB), which adopts a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) inorganic perovskite&#8208;like framework. The as&#8208;grown crystals show high resistivity (3.51&#215;1012&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm), low trap density (1.14&#215;1010&#8197;cm&#8722;3) and large carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;=1.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on GBB single crystals exhibit notable performances including low dark current drift, high sensitivity of ~1645.7&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and ultralow detection limit of ~0.85&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. This detection limit is among the lowest level for the reported 0D perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. This study illuminates the prospective research into novel lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskites for the advancement of high&#8208;performance detectors of irradiation.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ultralow detection limit of ~0.85&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This detection limit is among the lowest level for the reported 0D perovskite X-ray detectors.

         <title>Protonation of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation, as a straightforward post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy, enables precise tuning of covalent organic framework (COF) properties to improve their catalytic performance. This concept article highlights the advantages of protonation in enhancing COF properties, such as mass transfer kinetics, charge distribution, photo&#8208;response, and charge transfer, and discusses its effect on boosting photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials with ordered structures and tunable properties, which have been widely explored in catalysis, sensing, gas storage, and separation. Among various post&#8208;synthetic modifications, protonation emerges as a simple yet effective strategy to fine&#8208;tune the properties of nitrogen&#8208;containing COFs, thereby enhancing their catalytic performance. This concept article highlights the contribution of protonation on the mass transfer kinetics, charge distribution, photo&#8208;response, charge transfer, and other properties related to photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The applications of protonated COFs are explored in catalytic processes including hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, H2O2 synthesis, and singlet oxygen generation. We also emphasize the necessity of considering the protonation process when nitrogen&#8208;containing COFs are applied in acidic environments to accurately reveal the structure&#8208;activity relationship. By analyzing recent advancements in protonated COFs, this article underscores the potential and challenges of protonation as a powerful tool for advancing COF&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide/TiO2 Catalyzed Addition of Ethers, Alkylarenes and Aldehydes to Azodicarboxylates under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide/TiO2 photocatalytic system enabled the addition of ethers, alkylarenes and aldehydes to azodicarboxylates under visible light. The increased efficiency of photocatalysis is attributed to a homogeneous organocatalytic process involving phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals in solution. The developed conditions are suitable for complex natural compounds and hold potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
The addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to double bonds is one of the most atom&#8208;efficient approaches to the formation of new C&#8722;C or C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Existing approaches for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals often require elevated temperatures, UV radiation or expensive transition metal catalysts. In this work, a photocatalytic system based on a heterogeneous TiO2 catalyst and a redox organocatalyst N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide is proposed for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates or aldehydes at room temperature under visible light irradiation. The developed approach was successfully applied to the addition of ethers, alkylarenes and aldehydes to azodicarboxylates. Titanium oxide acts as a photocatalyst, producing phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals from N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide, thereby enabling the organocatalytic process in solution. Phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals act as catalytically active species that cleave C&#8722;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;centered radicals.

         <title>Methylaluminoxane Reactivities and Anionic Structures: From Small Oligomers to Large Sheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical study of small methylaluminoxane sheets (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m indicates that DFT electronically stabilizes those featuring 5&#8208;coordinate Al and 4&#8208;coordinate O compared with higher level MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations which favor 4&#8208;coordinate Al. The anions formed from these precursors all feature 4&#8208;coordinate Al and their relative stabilities explain the appearance of ESI&#8208;MS spectra recorded during the hydrolysis of Me3Al.







Abstract
The structure and reactivity of small methylaluminoxane (MAO) species (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m (n=1&#8208;8) have been investigated using DFT (M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. This hierarchy of methods reveals that DFT artificially stabilizes structures containing 4&#8208;coordinate oxygen atoms while higher&#8208;level calculations demonstrate a clear preference for structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum centers. Analysis of ionization pathways shows these neutral MAO molecules form anions through either methide or Me2Al+ abstraction, with the latter mechanism dominant for sheet structures (n=5&#8208;8). Smaller species (n=1&#8208;4, m &#8805; n) show minimal reactivity toward either ionization pathway. The resulting anions consistently adopt sheet structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum at all levels of theory. We introduce a comprehensive stability metric incorporating both ionization energies and neutral precursor stability, which successfully explains the distribution of anions observed in ESI&#8208;MS spectra during Me3Al hydrolysis. Extension of this analysis to larger species, including the recently isolated and characterized sheet (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 (Luo et&#8197;al., Science, 2024, 384, 1424&#8208;1428), reveals unexpected trends in reactivity.

Abstract
A quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione bearing a phenylene moiety and aliphatic tails was synthesized as an alternative self&#8208;assembling building block to barbiturate molecules, aiming to achieve enhanced hydrolysis resistance.

Our results demonstrate that quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione serves as an effective hydrogen&#8208;bonding building block, suggesting its potential to form stable supramolecular polymers from versatile &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Alternative and Sustainable Route to Explore a New Class of Amidines by Photochemical Synergistic Effect of Copper/Nitroxyl Radical Catalysis via Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical alternative and sustainable approach for synthesis of new class of amidines!! &#160;Synergistic Cu/nitroxyl radical catalysis is highly desirable to access nitrogen rich new class of amidines via XAT. This methodology covers 11 green chemistry metrics (GCM) out of 12 principles with high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal the role of light, in&#8197;situ formation of oxoammonium cation (TEMPO+) via XAT, substituent effect and order of the reaction.







Abstract
Amidines are a vital class of bioactive compounds and often necessitate multiple components for their synthesis. Therefore, exploring efficient and sustainable methodologies for their synthesis is indispensable. Herein, we disclose an alternative and greener method for synthesizing an unexplored new class of amidines through the photochemical synergistic effect of copper/nitroxyl radical catalysis. This approach facilitates site&#8208;selective radical amination of unactivated imine C(sp2)&#8722;H bond in C,N,N&#8208;cyclic imines over favored selectivity via halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). This greener method ticks 11 out of 12 green chemistry metrics (GCM), effectively sidestepping the need for oxidants, bases, ligands, multistep processes, and harsh conditions, distinguishing it from conventional methods described in previous studies. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational tools have been employed to elucidate the synergistic effect of Cu/nitroxyl radical, the role of light, XAT, the influence of substituents, and the order of the reaction in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Preoxidation Assisted Alkali Activation Constructs Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based Porous Carbon for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The porous structural tailoring of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based carbon materials is the key to maximize capacitive performance. Herein, hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) with high specific surface area and controllable porosity are synthesized by preoxidation assisted alkali activation strategy using polyacrylonitrile as the precursor. The results show that high preoxidation temperature is beneficial to increase the specific surface area and pore volume of HPC. The optimized HPC&#8208;300 has a high BET specific surface area of 3161 m2 g&#8208;1, a micropore volume of 1.45 cm3 g&#8208;1, and an AD/AG of 3.56. Electrochemical test shows that the specific capacitances of HPC&#8208;300 in 6 M KOH electrolyte at 1 A g&#8208;1 and 10 A g&#8208;1 are 314.1F g&#8208;1 and 213.0 F g&#8208;1, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 67.8%. The assembled supercapacitors based on HPC&#8208;300 deliver an energy density of 11.7 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 250.0 W kg&#8208;1 in KOH electrolyte and 21.1 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 450.0 W kg&#8208;1 in Na2SO4 electrolyte and possess a capacitance retention of 98.1% over 20,000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. This preoxidation coupled activation method provides a potential strategy for the preparation of PAN&#8208;based porous carbon with high specific surface area and capacitance.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of Catalytic Soot Oxidation by 3DOM Perovskite&#8208;Type La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; Catalysts: Structural Insights and K Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 3DOM La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalysts were synthesized using colloidal crystal templating and citric acid complexation methods. The substitution of K ions for A&#8208;site La ions was found to markedly enhance the catalysts' intrinsic activity, with the La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst showing exceptional performance comparable to commercial precious metal catalysts. The La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, with T10, T50, and T90 values of 280&#176;C, 335&#176;C, and 387&#176;C, respectively. The enhancement in intrinsic activity is primarily attributed to the electron&#8208;donating effect of K ions which maintains charge conservation and consequently increases the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of abundant active oxygen species. Additionally, the catalysts exhibited a highly ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores, facilitating the diffusion of soot particles and enhancing contact efficiency with active sites. These findings not only advance the understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in perovskite catalysts but also pave the way for the development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for low&#8208;temperature soot abatement.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Quantum Coherence Effects in Modulating Electron Transfer in Platinum Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum coherence effects (QCEs), arising from the interference of wave&#8208;like amplitudes, are crucial in controlling the electron transfer function of molecular systems. Here, we report a coherence phenomenon associated with charge separation (CS) in a range of Pt (II)&#160;cis&#8208;acetylide&#160;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems, where the photogenerated Pt (III) center acts as an acceptor connecting two (R)phenothiazine (R = H or tBu) donors. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that CS rates in D&#8208;A&#8208;D systems with double CS paths were accelerated by 4&#8208;8 times compared to their donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) counterparts with a single path. An enhancement factor of 2&#8208;3 in electronic coupling, within the context of interference between CS paths, is derived, providing a clear signature of QCEs. This enchantment in CS processes closely correlates with the strength of coupling between donors. This study highlights the significant impact of QCEs on the photophysical properties of molecular systems and offers insights into charge and energy transport mechanisms in both natural and artificial systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrolation of Melem: A Facile Gateway into the Field of Monomeric s&#8208;Heptazine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are an intriguing class of compounds with many attractive properties for various areas of application such as photocatalysis or organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research into these properties has so far been challenging, as only a few synthetic routes for the preparation of monomeric s&#8209;heptazines are known in the literature. Furthermore, these few reported synthetic pathways generally require the use of specialized equipment that may not be available to all laboratories interested in studying monomeric s&#8209;heptazines. For this reason, a more accessible synthetic route for the preparation of monomeric s&#8209;heptazines has been developed in the course of this work. The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine, which could be conveniently synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with bench&#8208;stable 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in a simple one&#8208;pot synthesis in air. This compound was shown to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of numerous other monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles. The monomeric s&#8209;heptazines thus accessible were analyzed for their crystal structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and for their optical properties by ultraviolet/visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding coupled Pd/Fe sites in electrospun MOF&#8208;derived carbon nanofibers achieves efficient and durable oxygen reduction catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High costs, poor durability of Pt electrocatalysts, and the low performance of non&#8208;precious metals hinder the large&#8208;scale commercialization of fuel cells. To address these challenges, a bimetallic, highly dispersed catalyst containing&#160; Pd and Fe uniformly distributed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was developed. This catalyst demonstrated remarkable oxygen reduction catalytic performance. The Pd&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst exhibited catalytic activity 4.6 times higher than that of the JM 20% Pt/C catalyst, despite containing only 0.62 wt% Pd. Moreover, it achieved a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2&#160;= 0.953 V vs. RHE) that is 40 mV higher than the JM 20% Pt/C catalyst (0.913 V vs. RHE). Significantly, with a total metal content of just 1.19 wt%, the E1/2&#160;of Pd&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst&#160;decreased by only 1 mV after 10,000 cycles, highlighting its exceptional durability. Furthermore, a stability test revealed a current retention rate of 84.87% after 50,000 s of operation, with no evidence of agglomeration. These results suggest that combining electrostatic spinning of MOFs with pyrolysis provides an effective and innovative method for synthesizing electrocatalysts with reduced reliance on precious metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Stereodivergent Synthesis of Substituted Tetrahydro&#8208;Benzo&#8208;(Oxa, Thia, &amp; Di)&#8208;azepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;, N,S&#8208; and N,N&#8208;containing heterocyclic moieties are found in several marketed drugs and biologically active molecules. However, the asymmetric synthesis of such heterocycles is limited to the use of transition metal catalysts or chiral phosphoric acids. In the current work, imine reductases (IREDs) are utilized to develop a general biocatalytic method for the stereodivergent synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazepines, 4&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzothiazepines, and 2,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in excellent yields (up to 96%), enantiomeric excess (up to &gt;99%) and diastereomeric excess&#160;(up to &gt;99%). In addition, imine reductase assisted reductive amination gave facile access to 2,4&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines starting from 1,3&#8208;diketone and 1,2&#8208;diamino benzene with excellent stereoselectivity and high yields. The absolute configuration of the newly synthesized N&#8208;heterocycles was determined using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). The presented methodology has further broadened the scope of IREDs towards the preparation of chiral seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles containing another heteroatom.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover Composite Film as Recyclable Catalyst for Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;based composite films represent a promising approach for developing recyclable catalysts. In this study, a [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film with spin crossover properties was fabricated using the blade casting method. Various characterisation techniques confirmed the uniform distribution of [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 particles within the TPU matrix, while maintaining the spin&#8208;crossover properties of the embedded complex. The composite film exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency and reusability in acetalization reaction, enabling efficient catalysis for up to 11 cycles under batch conditions and sustained activity for 7 hours under flow conditions. In addition, the color of the film served as a convenient visual indicator of its suitability for reuse in subsequent catalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film can serve as an effective and recyclable catalysts for acetalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum Photosensitizers on Trial: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, Photophysical and Photobiological Properties of Tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) Complexes with Long&#8208;lived Triplet States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal coordination compounds are currently a focus of research in developing new photosensitizers for materials and medicinal applications. As an abundant element in the earth&#8217;s crust aluminum is a suitable target element. However, only limited studies are available on its use in photoactive systems. We now report the facile preparation of a library of homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes. The majority of complexes was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their photophysical properties upon photoexcitation and their tendency to react with the molecular oxygen of the microenvironment and generate singlet oxygen &#8208; in polar and non&#8208;polar environment was investigated. These studies are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the possible electronic distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals within the complexes. As a result of charge transfer states, long&#8208;lived triplet excited states were formed and allowed for singlet oxygen generation. An initial screening of the AL(DIPY)3 complexes via in vitro phototoxicity studies against a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was promising as these complexes were able to trigger cell death upon irradiation at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations. The results highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties, conju&#173;gated B=N units, and p&#8208;phenylene building blocks in linearly concate&#173;nated architectural arrangements has been explored.

In addition, a series of well&#8208;defined co&#8208;oligomers composed of ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene moieties bridged by one or two B=N units in all possible combinations have been prepared, many of which have been structurally characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Pendent triisopropylphenyl groups on boron provide pronounced kinetic stabilization. Polycon&#173;densation of complementary monomers gave copolymers comprising alternating ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane building blocks, which were found to be cyclic in nature. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopic and electrochemical studies provided highly valuable insights into the interaction of the different moieties over the B=N bonds, particularly, the electronic communication between the elec&#173;troactive ferrocene units.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review highlights recent advancements in site&#8208;selective modification and labeling of native RNA, an important area for the development of RNA therapeutics and fundamental RNA research. The applications, current challenges of existing methods and potential future direction of this field are also discussed.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in regulating biological processes within living systems, with modified nucleosides serving as critical modulators of various aspects of biological functions. Therefore, the development of efficient methodologies for late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective RNA modification is of considerable interest, as it facilitates the functional exploration of RNA chemical modifications and their implications for therapeutic applications. Precise RNA modification holds significant promise for the treatment of genetic diseases by enabling the correction of mutated nucleobases to their wild&#8208;type forms. Additionally, the site&#8208;selective incorporation of synthetic labeling groups into RNA provides invaluable tools for structural and functional studies, thereby uncovering previously hidden dimensions of RNA&#8242;s role in biological systems. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of three principal approaches to site&#8208;selective, late&#8208;stage RNA modifications: enzyme&#8208;mediated strategies, catalytic nucleic acid&#8208;based techniques, and chemical methodologies. These approaches predominantly target the nucleobase or the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyl (2&#8217;&#8208;OH) group of RNA nucleosides. We evaluate the advantages and limitations of each strategy and discuss future directions for advancing this field of research.

         <title>Exploring Single Atom Substitution In Phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]Imidazole &#8208;Based D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A Architectures with Fluorene and its Heteroanalogs for Non&#8208;Volatile Resistive WORM Memory Device Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of single&#8208;atom substitution on the resistive switching memory behaviour of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architectured phenanthroimidazole &#8208;based small organic molecules has been investigated. The compounds exhibited excellent organic resistive performance with a low threshold voltage, a high ON/OFF current ratio, and a long retention time.







Abstract
A series of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A compounds, with fluorene and its heteroanalogs (carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene) as the donor units and phenanthroimidazole as the acceptor, were designed and synthesized for non&#8208;volatile memory device applications. The effect of single&#8208;atom substitution on memory behavior was examined through optical, electrochemical, and computational studies. The photophysical studies confirm a significant intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the electrochemical analysis shows an irreversible anodic peak (0.99&#8211;1.21&#8197;V) with an optimal band gap ranging from 2.80 to 2.88&#8197;eV. All the compounds exhibited non&#8208;volatile binary WORM memory behaviour with an ON/OFF current ratio of 105 and 103. The devices also showed excellent stability over 100 cycles and maintained a retention time of 4000&#8197;s. Notably, the compound with carbazole substitution displayed a lower threshold voltage and a higher ON/OFF current ratio of 105. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the combined effects of charge transfer and charge trapping mechanisms are crucial to the resistive switching mechanisms observed. This work highlights the potential of single atom substitution in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A systems, providing valuable insights for designing high&#8208;performance data storage devices.

     alt="Exploring Single Atom Substitution In Phenanthro[9,10-d]Imidazole -Based D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A Architectures with Fluorene and its Heteroanalogs for Non-Volatile Resistive WORM Memory Device Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of single-atom substitution on the resistive switching memory behaviour of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architectured phenanthroimidazole -based small organic molecules has been investigated. The compounds exhibited excellent organic resistive performance with a low threshold voltage, a high ON/OFF current ratio, and a long retention time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A compounds, with fluorene and its heteroanalogs (carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene) as the donor units and phenanthroimidazole as the acceptor, were designed and synthesized for non-volatile memory device applications. The effect of single-atom substitution on memory behavior was examined through optical, electrochemical, and computational studies. The photophysical studies confirm a significant intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the electrochemical analysis shows an irreversible anodic peak (0.99&#8211;1.21&#8197;V) with an optimal band gap ranging from 2.80 to 2.88&#8197;eV. All the compounds exhibited non-volatile binary WORM memory behaviour with an ON/OFF current ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The devices also showed excellent stability over 100 cycles and maintained a retention time of 4000&#8197;s. Notably, the compound with carbazole substitution displayed a lower threshold voltage and a higher ON/OFF current ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the combined effects of charge transfer and charge trapping mechanisms are crucial to the resistive switching mechanisms observed. This work highlights the potential of single atom substitution in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A systems, providing valuable insights for designing high-performance data storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Redox&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Mono&#8208; and Diradical Iridium(III) Complexes: Insights into Molecular and Electronic Structure, Electrochemistry, and Spin&#8208;Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic method has been developed for stable iridium(III) radical complexes via in&#8208;situ metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand electron transfer, which have been characterized using structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic techniques. A weak antiferromagnetic spin&#8208;spin interaction between the radical centers has been observed and validated through theoretical calculations. Additionally, a novel template synthesis of a diazotate complex derived from a bisazo&#8208;aromatic precursor is reported.







Abstract
Two &#960;&#8208;radical complexes containing bisazo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;centered radical anion (1&#8901;&#8722;) were synthesized through in&#8208;situ electron transfer from metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand using [IrI] and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyridylazo)azobenzene (1) in inert hydrocarbon solvent. These are characterized as diradical [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)2]+ [2]+ and monoradical [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)Cl2(PPh3)] 3. In contrast, a rare metal&#8208;mediated hydrolytic cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond occurred in protic solvent resulting in quaternary radical complex [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)(1&#8242;)(PPh3)]+ (4)+. This provides an easy way to synthesize stable unsubstituted pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;diazotate (1&#8242;), an otherwise unstable organic template. Theoretical scrutiny has been performed at (U)B3LYP/6&#8211;31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level to explore the origin of redox and optical properties in radical complexes. Magnetic study of [2]+ reveals that a weak antiferromagnetic (AF) spin&#8208;communication (J = &#8722;4.39&#8197;cm&#8722;1) exists between two radicals, leading to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. Broken symmetry density functional theory (BS&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to probe the nature of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two radical centers in species [2]+. This method has been employed with different basis functionals (BP86, BLYP, OLYP, TPSS0, TPSSh, &#969;b97D and B3LYP) to comprehend the nature of the exchange in [2]+. The best result is obtained for pure functional OLYP with a J value &#8722;8.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Non&#8208;Planar Cyclophenylene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of an unprecedent gold&#8208;complexed cyclophenylene with meta&#8208; and para&#8208;phenylene linkages has been achieved by means of on&#8208;surface promoted dimerization of a 1,10&#8208;dibrominated angular [3] phenylene followed by regioselective fourfold C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond activation at the four&#8208;membered rings. This finding highlights the non&#8208;trivial on&#8208;surface reactivity of [N] phenylenes and opens new perspectives for the synthesis of 3D cyclophenylenes and other carbon frameworks on solid surfaces.







Abstract
We report the surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of a non&#8208;planar cyclophenylene derivative containing four meta&#8208; and two para&#8208; connected phenylene moieties on Au(111), via hierarchical Ullmann coupling of a 1,10&#8208;dibrominated angular [3] phenylene and subsequent C&#8722;C bond cleavage at the four&#8208;membered rings. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) were used for the characterization of its chemical structure and electronic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental observations.

         <title>Catalytic Serine Labeling in Nonaqueous, Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serine&#8208;targeting protein bioconjugation has been a formidable challenge because of the modest reactivity of the alkyl alcohol group in aqueous media. This work demonstrates a biomolecule&#8208;compatible, nonaqueous approach to achieve alkyl alcohol&#8208;selective labeling through acid&#8208;catalyzed esterification reactions, which offers a unique advantage over the existing serine protease&#8208;targeting method using a fluorophosphonate reagent.







Abstract
Chemoselective modification of alkyl alcohols (e.&#8201;g., serine residues) on proteins has been a daunting challenge especially in aqueous media. Herein, we report chemical modification of alkyl alcohols in protein and cell lysate samples using carboxylic acid&#8208;based bioconjugation media. The acidic medium is not only useful to suppress reactivity of other nucleophiles in proteins, but the medium also serves as a potentially biomolecule&#8208;compatible solvent. The acid&#8208;catalyzed acylation strategy has a unique selectivity paradigm compared to the common active&#8208;serine&#8208;targeted method and would act as a new strategy for studying biological roles of serine residues.

         <title>Development of pH&#8208;Responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS Hydrogels via Michael Addition for Controlled Drug Release and Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogels through Michael addition reactions to achieve controlled drug release and enhanced mechanical properties. The hydrogels exhibit tunable swelling and degradation behaviors under various pH conditions, demonstrating their potential for targeted drug delivery. These hydrogels offer promising prospects for biomedical applications, providing efficient drug loading, controlled release, and improved mechanical strength.







Abstract
In this study, thiolated sodium alginate (SA) and hydrophilic, polymerizable Janus&#8208;type polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (AS&#8208;POSS) are synthesized by introducing thiol and sulfonic acid groups, respectively. A series of pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS nanocomposite hydrogels are successfully prepared through Michael addition reactions between the thiol groups of thiolated sodium alginate and the double bonds in the molecular chains of AS&#8208;POSS and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). This reaction proceeds rapidly under physiological conditions without requiring initiators or catalysts. As the content of AS&#8208;POSS increases, the pore size within the hydrogel decreases, and the network structure becomes denser, with significant improvements in mechanical properties. The hydrogel exhibits excellent pH sensitivity, showing lower swelling in acidic media compared to neutral media, and undergoing hydrolysis and losing stability in alkaline media. Moreover, the incorporation of AS&#8208;POSS significantly enhances the drug&#8208;loading capacity (85.7&#8201;%) and encapsulation efficiency (72.1&#8201;%) of doxorubicin (DOX). The drug is released faster in weakly acidic environments, with a cumulative release rate reaching 80.4&#8201;%, demonstrating excellent targeting and controlled release properties. Cytotoxicity tests show that the SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogel has good biocompatibility and exhibits effective tumor&#8208;killing ability, indicating its great potential as a drug carrier with promising applications in biomedical materials.

         <title>Progress in Double Dearomatization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper presents an overview of the strategies and detailed examples of double dearomatization reactions involving various aromatic compounds, along with a discussion of the related mechanisms and the major challenges that still exist in this intriguing yet formidable field.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions are among the most straightforward and efficient methods for creating sp3&#8208;rich cyclic systems from simple, readily available arenes. These reactions have been widely applied in the total synthesis of natural products, medicinal chemistry, and material sciences. The fruitful development of dearomatization strategies and methodologies targeting single aromatic substrate over the past decades has paved the way for more sophisticated multiple dearomatization processes, which offer greater advantages in constructing molecular complexity. Double dearomatization reactions have made significant pioneering strides in recent years. This review will provide an overview of the strategies and detailed examples of multiple dearomatization reactions involving various aromatic compounds, along with a discussion of the related mechanisms and the major challenges that remain in this intriguing yet formidable field.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Redox Divergent Hydrated Ring Expansion of Butafulvenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By providing highly functionalized building blocks in an efficient approach, catalytic hydration of alkenes plays a significant role in fundamental chemical transformations and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, hydration reactions have predominantly involved water and alkenes double bond alignment. Herein, we developed a regio&#8208; and redox divergent hydrated ring expansion protocol of butafulvenes. With the aid of PdII or acid catalysis, various highly functionalized and unsaturated cyclopentanone derivatives could be obtained in high regioselectivities under oxidative or redox neutral conditions. Isotope labeling experiments suggest that the carbonylic oxygen atom of target product is derived from water. In addition, the unsaturated cyclopentanone intermediate could undergo divergent transformations and serve as a key molecule to create skeletal editing compounds of butafulvenes via one&#8208;pot protocol, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>The Next Generation of Phosphorus Bisylide Superbases &#8211; Synthesis, Structures, Basicity and Proton Self Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present two phosphorus ylide superbases to enhance the basicity of MHPN &#8211; the first superbase with interacting carbon atoms as basicity centers. Its 1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl substituted analog MTPN and MHPN&#8217;s theoretically predicted higher homologue P2&#8208;MHPN exhibit extreme pKaH values of 26.0 and 29.5 (experimental) in THF solution and 33.6 and 37.4 (estimated) in acetonitrile solution. The corresponding calculated gas phase basicity values are 281.4 and 284.6 kcal/mol, respectively. We prepared the neutral free bases together with the corresponding mono&#8208; and bisprotonated species which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and partly XRD analysis. The monoprotonated forms exhibit a rapid proton self&#8208;exchange between the two carbon atoms in peri&#8208;position and dynamic NMR spectroscopic methods revealed self&#8208;exchange rates of &#8232;2298 s&#8208;1 and 300 s&#8208;1 at 300 K for MTPN and P2&#8208;MHPN. However, computational studies reveal that the proton chelating effect, which typically considerably contributes to the basicity of proton sponges with basicity centers on nitrogen, is negligible in ylide proton sponges, as the 1,8&#8208;substitution pattern yields almost the same basicity as the corresponding 2,7&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;substituted analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt(II) Complexes Showing Multicolor Emissions from Nanoparticles in Solution and Reversible Grinding&#8208; and Heating&#8208;Induced Luminescence Switching in Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To well understand luminescence modulation of Pt(II) complexes by inter&#8208;molecular interactions, three platinum complexes [Pt(moppy)Cl(L)] have been synthesized (Scheme 1) through incorporating the same C^N ligand moppyH = 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine, while different auxillary ligands L: SEt2 in 1, iccy = isocyanocyclohexane in 2, and icna = isocyanonaphthalene in 3. Crystal structures indicate that neighbouring molecules are connected through &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, forming supramolecular dimer structures in both 1 and 2, while supramolecular chain structure in 3. In a CH3CN&#8208;H2O mixed solvent, complexes 1&#8208;3 reveal enhanced luminescence due to nanoparticle formation. Upon increasing water fraction from 0% to 90%, complex 1 exhibits increasing green luminescence with two broad emissions at 450 and 516 nm. In contrast, both 2 and 3 show multicolour emissions, transiting from blue to yellow&#8208;green for 2, and from blue green to orange red for 3. Moreover, complex 3 exhibits reversible luminescence switching between on state with orange&#8208;red emission and off state upon alternately grinding and heating. In this paper, we discuss the influences of molecular structures and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Pt&#8208;Pt interactions on luminescence behaviours of complexes 1&#8208;3.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Nanoparticles Loaded on Bimetallic Porphyrinic MOF for Selective Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) loaded on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show promising catalytic performances in various reactions, but finely tuning the electronic properties of MNPs remains challenging. Herein, metal NP&#8208;MOF synergy has been finely regulated by incorporating Pt NPs into PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo). The as&#8208;prepared Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo) exhibited high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of various carbonyl substrates. Detailed characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Fe/Co sites of the ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Pt NPs, which achieved promoted capability to activate H2. The atomic hydrogen (H*) produced by Pt sites mainly migrated to the Co sites to promote the hydrogenation process via hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. This work is devoted to a promising strategy to optimize the catalytic performance of MOF&#8208;based nanomaterials by incorporating metal NPs in the thermocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Consecutive Pathways Competing for Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on preparation methods, NDI molecules can assemble into J&#8208;type or H&#8208;type fibers along two pathways in organic solutions. Intermediate aggregates are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques along both pathways and further verified by thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting, suggesting two consecutive assembling pathways from identical initial conditions.







Abstract
The final outcomes of supramolecular assembly are determined by the pathways and the formation of intermediates during the assembly process. We studied pathway complexity involving two consecutive pathways in supramolecular polymerization of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) derivative molecule. Depending on preparation methods anisotropic aggregates of J&#8208;type nanorods (Agg&#8197;I) or more flexible H&#8208;type nanofibers (Agg&#8197;II) are obtained from the identical initial state in solution of methyl cyclohexane (MCH) or MCH/CHCl3 mixtures. More interestingly intermediate aggregates driven by intra&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques for both pathways. Thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting suggests that both pathways are consecutive ones with intermediate aggregates. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, we propose the molecular packing of Agg&#8197;I and II. Our results reveal comprehensive pathway complexity in self&#8208;assembly of molecules as simple as NDI.

         <title>Development of Triphenylamine Derived Photosensitizers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New organic photosensitizers, with a triphenylamine&#8208;based molecular framework, were synthesized and characterized. The DBT&#8208;CN dye showed an impressive turnover number of 10,555 and an initial turnover frequency of 152.6&#8197;h&#8722;1 under green light. The (donor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor design outperformed the (acceptor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor configuration in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, remaining stable after prolonged light exposure.







Abstract
A series of new (donor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) and (acceptor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) organic photosensitizers based on the framework of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acrylic acid have been synthesized and characterized. By incorporating groups with different electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing abilities, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), dibenzofuran (DBF), and triazine (TA), into the triphenylamine segment, their photophysical properties have been regulated. Theoretical calculations were used to explore how various donor&#8208;acceptor combinations influence their hydrogen production performance. Notably, DBF&#8208;CN achieved the highest turnover number (TON) of 10,202 and an initial turnover frequency (TOFi) of 151.6&#8197;h&#8722;1 under green light irradiation, with an initial activity (Activityi) of 113,532&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQYi) of 0.76&#8201;%. This dye&#8208;sensitized&#8208;TiO2&#8208;Pt system is recognized as one of the most efficient and durable systems for photocatalytic hydrogen production under green light irradiation, as described in the literature, when compared using TOF and TON values. Experimental results indicate that the D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system significantly enhances photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance more effectively than the A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system, while also maintaining stability under prolonged light exposure.

         <title>Discovery of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazin&#8208;5&#8208;One Derivative CJ1&#8208;34 as a Partial ATP Synthase Inhibitor for CNS Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel structural scaffolds for targeting ATP synthase with appropriate properties to cross blood&#8208;brain barrier were designed, synthesised, and evaluated by in&#8197;vitro assays. CJ1&#8208;34 was identified as a partial ATP synthase inhibitor with a determined IC50 of 394&#8197;nM in isolated bovine mitochondria, which can be further explored as a potential CNS drug for disease where mitochondria are implicated.







Abstract
ATP synthase dysregulation has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Whilst ATP synthase&#8208;targeting compounds have been reported, most are large or polar compounds and lack appropriate properties for a CNS drug. We designed, synthesised, and evaluated a novel series of ATP synthase targeting compounds, resulting in a 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;5&#8208;one scaffold with improved physiochemical properties. In&#8197;vitro evaluation of our library led to the discovery of CJ1&#8208;34 as a partial ATP synthase inhibitor with a determined IC50 of 394&#8197;nM in isolated bovine mitochondria. Molecular docking experiments demonstrated that calculated docking scores aligned with the observed in&#8197;vitro pharmacology and supports the F1 region of the ATP synthase as the potential binding site. Overall, this provides the foundation to further investigate CJ1&#8208;34 as a potential CNS drug for diseases where mitochondria are implicated, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Photochemistry: A cheap, metal&#8208;free, photochemical protocol for the 1,4&#8208;decarboxylative addition between carboxylic acids and electron&#8208;deficient olefins, under irradiation at 427&#8197;nm, utilizing the cheap, metal&#8208;free, commercially available, thioxanthone or thioxanthone&#8208;TfOH complex as the suitable photocatalyst. A broad substrate scope, bearing a variety of functional groups is introduced producing the desired products in high yields.







Abstract
Synthetic photochemistry is an alternative, green and sustainable approach in organic synthesis, offering the possibility for the discovery of novel reactivities. Carboxylic acids are abundant and widely used as suitable radical precursors for light&#8208;mediated processes, providing access to products that are not accessible via conventional methods. Herein, we report a green, cheap, metal&#8208;free, photochemical decarboxylative protocol for the 1,4&#8208;radical conjugate addition (Giese reaction) using thioxanthone, a commercially available organic molecule, or a thioxanthone&#8208;triflic acid (TfOH) complex, as the photocatalyst, under LED 427&#8197;nm irradiation. A wide range of carboxylic acids, amino acids and Michael acceptors has been tested, affording the desired products in good to high yields.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Reduction of Carbon Monoxide with Magnesium Alkyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective homologation of CO with the magnesium alkyl compounds is achieved by using a nickel catalyst. Both control experiments and DFT calculations showcase the crucial roles of Mg/Ni cooperation and heterobimetallic carbene complexes during the reactions.







Abstract
Research on CO activation and homologation is pivotal for promoting sustainable chemistry and the construction of Cn molecular blocks. This work reports the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reduction of CO by magnesium alkyl compounds utilizing a bimetallic Mg/Ni synergistic strategy. The exposure of &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand&#8208;supported magnesium monoalkyl compounds LMgR (L=[(DippNCMe)2CH]&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; R=nBu, CH3, C5H9) to 1&#8197;bar of CO in the presence of 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ni(COD)2 (COD: 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) selectively afforded the CO single&#8208;insertion product [LMg(CHO)C5H8], the dimerization product [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;C2O2)(CH3)2], and the linear trimerization product [(LMg)2(&#956;&#8208;C3O3)(nBu)2], respectively, depending on the R group. In addition, transition metal&#8208;stabilized carbene species resulted from CO activation were successfully isolated through stoichiometric control experiments. The profiles of CO trimerization and dimerization were further elucidated by density functional theory calculations, which confirmed the crucial roles of Mg/Ni cooperation and carbene species in the current reaction.

         <title>A Boosting Strategy of Photovoltaics by Stacking Monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb into Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

By stacking monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb into InSe/&#946;&#8208;Sb vdWH, enhanced photovoltaic efficiencies in visible light range and red&#8208;shift photocurrent in the infrared region can be achieved. This enhancement is attributed to the type&#8208;II band alignment for more efficient real&#8208;space carrier separation, more moderate and indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bad gap, higher electron/hole carrier mobility, enlarged visible light harvesting than each component.







Abstract
Identifying two&#8208;dimensional (2D) solar photovoltaic devices with high efficiency remains an urgent challenge in addressing current energy demands. Considering the limitations of isolated 2D systems in the photovoltaic applications, the most effective solution is stacking them into van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). However, the favorable factors for photovoltaics in vdWHs are still uncertain, nor is their intrinsic enrichment or enhancement mechanism on photovoltaics being clear. Here, based on the typical monolayer transition metal&#8208;chalcogenide compound InSe and &#946;&#8208;phase antimonene (Sb), we propose a boosting strategy on photovoltaic performances by stacking them into the InSe/Sb vdWH. After confirming the feasibility of its experimental synthesis, several superior photovoltaic related characteristics are verified than its components. Including the more moderately sized indirect to direct band gap, the higher electron mobilities than those of monolayer InSe, the hindrance of carrier recombination due to the staggered type&#8208;II band alignment, and the stronger and red&#8208;shifted optical harvesting abilities because of the band redistribution. In addition, further researches are conducted on the additional superior characteristics of such stacked InSe/Sb vdWH in 2D photovoltaic devices. Such as the red&#8208;shifted photocurrent into the infrared light range, the superior photoelectric conversion efficiencies in the visible light region, and the higher photovoltaic quality factors including the photon responsivity

 than its components and many other typical vdWHs.

         <title>Global and Local Shielding/Deshielding Variation in C60 and C70 Fullerenes Upon Reduction: Evaluation of Aromaticity, 13C&#8208;NMR and Anisotropy Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six&#8208;fold reduction of C60 and C70 fullerenes modifies the magnetic response of the &#960; electrons enabling global and local variations of shielding/deshielding regions along different orientations of the external field which are represented in the variations of 13C&#8208;NMR shifts given by the &#963;33 shielding component under the principal axis system (PAS) of the chemical shift anisotropy.







Abstract
Fullerenes are statically pleasant species featuring symmetric cages, which can be modified upon reduction. Here, we theoretically account for the variation of 13C&#8208;NMR patterns in C60 and C70 upon six&#8208;fold reduction and the overall variation of the enabled shielding/deshielding regions induced by &#960; and &#963; electrons according to different orientations of the external field and the related anisotropy. Our results show a significant modification of the chemical shift given by the main variation of the &#963;33 (or &#948;33) shielding component under the principal axis system (PAS) of the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) at the representative carbon nucleus. For C606&#8722; a shielding cone property is enabled from any orientation, accounting for a significant spherical aromatic character. In contrast, in C706&#8722;, a shielding cone is reserved only for an axial&#8208;oriented field, with a deshielding cone behavior obtained from the complementary equatorial orientations. The overall anisotropy shows an inner isotropic region for C60 and C606&#8722;, with a continuous anisotropic outer contour for the latter. In contrast, C70 and C706&#8722; both show larger anisotropies, given the lesser spherical shape in addition to the modified &#960;&#8208;surface. Such information is useful for further rationalizing the implementation of magnetic anisotropic molecular devices into fullerene&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Bisphosphonate&#8208;Based Viologens as Negolytes for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisphosphonate&#8208;substituted viologens (BBPE&#8208;Vi and MBPE&#8208;Vi) exhibit high solubility (1.45 M) and stability (0.009% capacity decay per cycle), making them effective for AOFBs. The bulky, negatively charged bisphosphonate groups reduce degradation through bimolecular side reactions, while their electron&#8208;rich character in the deprotonated state effectively lowers the redox potential (&#8722;0.503 V and &#8722;0.550 V against SHE for MBPE&#8208;Vi and BBPE&#8208;Vi, respectively).







Abstract
Viologen derivatives feature two reversible one&#8208;electron redox processes and have been extensively utilized in aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). However, the early variant, methyl viologen (MVi), exhibits low stability in aqueous electrolytes, restricting its practical implementation in AOFB technology. In this context, leveraging the tunability of organic molecules, various substituents have been incorporated into the viologen core to achieve better stability, lower redox potential, and improved solubility. In this work, we introduce bisphosphonate&#8208;substituted viologens (BBPE&#8722;Vi and MBPE&#8722;Vi) as candidates for AOFBs. The bulkiness and negative charges of the bisphosphonate groups enhance the solubility and the electrostatic repulsion among viologen molecules, minimizing the bimolecular side reactions that lead to degradation. Additionally, the electron&#8208;rich character of this new substituent in its deprotonated state significantly lowers the redox potential. As a result, the proposed viologen derivatives exhibit high solubility (1.45&#8197;M in water) and stability (capacity decay of 0.009&#8201;%/cycle or 0.229&#8201;%/day when tested at 0.5&#8197;M). These parameters are coupled with the lowest redox potentials exceeding all previously reported viologens utilized in AOFBs (&#8722;0.503&#8197;V and &#8722;0.550&#8197;V against SHE for MBPE&#8722;Vi and BBPE&#8722;Vi, respectively).

         <title>A Unique Intramolecular Redox Reaction by Unidirectional Migration of Three Hydrogen Atoms: Theoretical Elucidation of the 3H&#8208;Transfer Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed computational investigation was performed for two unidirectional multiple hydrogen rearrangements occurring in gaseous radical cations of 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;butanol. Based on early mass spectrometry studies employing isotope labelling and on recent ion spectroscopic studies, our results provide a clear mechanistic picture for these peculiar redox processes discovered almost 40&#8197;years ago.







Abstract
The intramolecular migration of three hydrogen atoms from one moiety of a gaseous radical cation to the other prior to fragmentation is an extremely rare type of redox reaction. Within the scope of this investigation, this scenario requires an ionized but electron&#8208;rich arene acceptor bearing a para&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxyalkyl) residue. The precise mechanism of such unidirectional 3H transfer processes, including the order of the individual H transfer steps, has remained unclear in spite of previous isotope labelling and recent infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) studies. Herein, the details of this peculiar process have been investigated for ionized 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;butanol, 2, by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetically most favorable pathway consists of a sequence of successive 1,4&#8208;, 1,6&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;H steps. During these steps the secondary alcohol functionality is oxidized to a carbonyl group and the radical&#8208;cationic aniline ring is reduced to an ionized 2,3&#8211;dihydroaniline unit. Several alternative sequences, such as three successive 1,5&#8208;H shifts, could be excluded. A concomitant unidirectional 2H migration reaction of ion 2 was also investigated and the intermediacy of ion&#8208;neutral complexes (INCs) enabling sequential hydride and proton transfer was confirmed by the calculations.

Mechanofluorochromism and mechanoluminescence materials have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications. Among the various building blocks utilized in these materials, phenothiazine has emerged as a widely employed fundamental component. In this review article, we summary the recent researches of MFC and ML for phenothiazine derivatives and analogues.







Abstract
Mechanofluorochromism (MFC) and mechanoluminescence (ML) materials have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optical recording, photodynamic therapy, bioimaging, stress sensing, display technology, and ink&#8208;free printing paper. Among the various building blocks utilized in these materials, phenothiazine (PTZ) has emerged as a widely employed fundamental component owing to its distinctive electronic and optical properties as well as its facile modification capabilities. Summarizing the recent progress of PTZ derivatives and analogues in this field holds practical significance. In this review article, we classify over one hundred compounds into a few classes based on the positions of substituents and provide detailed descriptions of their contributions to MFC and ML research respectively. This comprehensive review aims to offer theoretical insights and practical examples for researchers engaged in designing and developing new phenothiazine functional materials while serving as a bridge for further exploration of MFC or ML studies.

         <title>Tuning Optical Properties of Organic Thin Films through Intermolecular Interactions &#8211; Fundamentals, Advances and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation of dyes can significantly alter their electronic and optical properties through various physical mechanisms. In this review, we review their fundamentals, their relevance in research and practical applications, and the extent of property changes observed upon aggregation so far.







Abstract
In applications ranging from photon&#8208;energy conversion into electrical or chemical forms (such as photovoltaics or photocatalysis) to numerous sensor technologies based on organic solids, the role of supramolecular structures and chromophore interactions is crucial. This review comprehensively examines the critical intermolecular interactions between organic dyes and their impact on optical properties. We explore the range of changes in absorption or emission properties observed in molecular aggregates compared to single molecules. Each effect is dissected to reveal its physicochemical foundations, relevance to different application domains, and documented examples from the literature that illustrate the potential modulation of absorption or emission properties by molecular and supramolecular structural adjustments. This work aims to serve as a concise guide for exploiting supramolecular phenomena in the innovation of novel optical and optoelectronic organic materials, with emphasis on strategic application and exploitation.

         <dc:description>Two pentamethine dyes with nearly identical structures but slightly different dipole moments were prepared as ion pairs. The ion pairs provided charge&#8208;segregated assemblies stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between the positively charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems. The stacking structure of the bromo&#8208;substituted pentamethine cation was more stabilized by a larger dipole moment, as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Depending on the packing arrangements, highly electric conductive properties were observed owing to charge&#8208;segregated structures, as also correlated with the theoretically estimated transfer integrals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An octanuclear M8L12&#160;coordination cage host (HPEG) in aqueous solution binds neutral electron&#8208;accepting guests such as naphthoquinone (NQ) in its central cavity&#160;via&#160;the hydrophobic effect, and multiple anionic photosensitisers such as Eosin&#8208;Y (EY2&#8208;) around the exterior surface due to 16+ charge on the complex cation: this is confirmed by both solution titration experiments and X&#8208;ray crystallography.&#160;&#160;In the three&#8208;component assembly&#160;HPEG&#160;/ EY2&#8208;&#160;/ NQ, photoexcitation of&#160;EY2&#8208;&#160;at 525 nm results in ultrafast (ca.&#160;1 ps) photoinduced&#160;EY2&#8208;&#160;&#174;&#160;NQ&#160;electron transfer from surface&#8208;bound&#160;EY2&#8208;&#160;to cavity&#8208;bound&#160;NQ&#160;(which have been brought into close proximity by their interactions with different sites on the host cage) to give the charge&#8208;separated pair&#160;EY&#8226;&#8211;&#160;/ NQ&#8226;&#8211;, identified by transient absorption spectroscopy: back&#8208;ET results in charge recombination in &#8776;70 ps.&#160;&#160;The assembly of donor and acceptor components&#160;via&#160;orthogonal interactions using the host cage as a scaffold presents a promising route into spatial control of multiple components in supramolecular arrays for photophysical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control and Trapping in the Supramolecular Polymerization of m&#8208;Terphenyl Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we examine pathway complexity in the supramolecular polymerization of a novel&#160;m&#8208;terphenyl bis&#8208;urea macrocycle. Designed to induce kinetically metastable states, the macrocycle's concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation was studied via &#185;H NMR and IR spectroscopy in THF and CHCl&#8323;. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy in water/THF revealed a cooperative nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism, indicated by a shift in &#955;max to longer wavelengths upon cooling. Morphological studies using DLS, AFM, and SEM demonstrated fibrous aggregate formation. Thermal hysteresis observed in assembly&#8208;disassembly cycles indicated kinetically trapped species, with cooling governed by kinetic control and heating by thermodynamic processes. Deviations in &#916;H values during cooling, compared to van't Hoff analysis and alignment of heating &#916;H values with thermodynamic predictions, reinforced this distinction. Spontaneous nucleation retardation, resulting from monomer trapping, led to lag times of up to 50 minutes under specific conditions. Computational studies revealed parallel urea conformation as the more stable monomer configuration, whereas the antiparallel conformation is more stable in dimers. By probing pathway complexity of the macrocycle, we demonstrate a distinct ability to control and stabilize kinetically trapped states, broadening the scope for designing macrocyclic supramolecular polymers with tailored properties. This work deepens our understanding of supramolecular dynamics, exploring ON&#8208;pathway mechanisms and advancing tunable supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on CuFeO2&#160;Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the reaction pathways for the conversion of N2&#160;to NH3&#160;on CuFeO2&#160;(CFO) by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Concentrating on the most stable (012) surface orientation, two systems were examined: the pristine (012) surface and the corresponding oxygen defective surface. To find the thermodynamic stable pathway, the associative Heyrovsk&#253;&#160;mechanism was considered, containing four different reaction pathways.&#160; The reaction intermediates predominantly interact with the iron sites on the surface, following the distal alternating reaction pathway via the formation of hydrazine. Introducing oxygen defects changes the reaction mechanism to a Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen&#8208;type mechanism, avoiding the formation of hydrazine, while the Gibbs free energy of the first hydrogenation step is lowered by 1.17 eV (from 2.17 to 1.00 eV). Analyzing the charge density distribution reveals that oxygen defective surface enables CFO to facilitate a &#960;&#8208;backdonation between iron sites and the NRR intermediates, increasing the intermediate&#8208;surface interaction. This indicates an enhanced catalytic activity for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) by generating oxygen lattice defects in CFO.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Imine Tautomeric Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Alcohol and Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To study the amine&#8208;imine tautomeric alteration through excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), three amine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized by using two different metal ions and neutral linkers along with same ESIPT&#8208;enable anionic linker through the slow diffusion process. All the MOFs have 2D structure with asymmetric units of {[Mn(2,6&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](H2O)(CH3OH)}n(1), {[Mn(3,5&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](solvent)x}n(2) and {Zn2(3,5&#8208;dip)2(2&#8208;atp)(&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8208;)](solvent)x}n(3) (where 2,6&#8208;dip = 2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 3,5&#8208;dip = 3,5&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 2&#8208;atp = 2&#8208;amino terephthalic acid). The 2D networks of desolvated form of compound 1, 2, and 3 show water influencing proton transfer for amine&#8208;imine tautomerism in excited state through the ionic interaction with water molecules to the frameworks. However, in case of polar small chain aliphatic alcohols like methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; the compounds does not show any dual emissive ESIPT but exhibit three different intensified single peaks for each of the compounds. This different emission intensity in presence of different alcohols are helpful to detect these alcohols selectively. In addition to that in case of all three compounds, the water assisted&#8208;ESIPT is interrupted by some strong oxidizing agents like CrO42&#8208;, Cr2O72&#8208; and MnO4&#8208; ions. This phenomenon allows the method of detection for the aforesaid oxidizing ions in water by interruption of the dual emissive fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordered Assembly of Natural Phenolic Building Blocks for Supramolecular Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides a concise overview of recent advancements in crystalline materials constructed from natural phenolic building blocks. The discussion covers typical ordered assemblies such as frameworks and mesocrystals, highlighting their respective chemical mechanisms. Finally, the Concept outlines persistent challenges in this field and suggests potential directions for future development.







Abstract
Biomacromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids in nature are constructed by &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; assembly with diverse functions and structural ordered characteristics. Supramolecular assemblies have been employed to mimic the natural complexity by manipulating the subtle variations of functional groups. Nevertheless, the intricate design of the driving forces or sophisticated synthesis of molecular skeletons poses challenges in fabricating highly ordered assemblies. Natural phenolic molecules with anisotropic functional groups exhibit potential as versatile building blocks for a wide range of supramolecular crystalline materials with tailored assembly and controlled functionalities. The inherent and anisotropic phenolic groups engage in ordered assembly with various materials via directional covalent bonds (e.&#8201;g., condensation and coordination) as well as multiple molecular interactions (e.&#8201;g., hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions), leading to the formation of supramolecular crystalline materials with diverse functionalities. This Concept presents the assembly mechanisms of crystalline phenolic materials and their applications, showcasing the effective utilization of ordered assembly by natural phenolic building blocks.

         <title>Scalable Production of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>

The scaling&#8208;up process of a continuous injection protocol used to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions is described. Synthesis and processing were controlled with special attention to increasing synthesis yield and controlling product quality.







Abstract
This work describes the scalability process of a continuous&#8208;injection protocol employed to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions. Different levels of manipulation starting from the synthesis and processing also related to the tuning of the optical response (considering the peculiar combination of UV and NIR absorption with visible transparency) make these materials incredibly versatile. But one of the most attractive features concern the modulation of their charge carrier density through chemical or post&#8208;synthetic doping, as for the case of core&#8208;shell materials, expanding the properties of the core composition. In addition, the colloidal nature of such materials allows for easy solution processing which enables an extensive use in different applications within current thin films base technologies. It is therefore important to push forward the lab&#8208;scale synthesis to properly address the commercial fabrication requirements without any loss in quality. Uniformity is crucial for industrial applications, ensuring predictable performance and facilitating the integration of these nanoparticles into optoelectronic devices. The method here developed allowed a transition from mg&#8208;scale to gram&#8208;scale product mass outputs, while retaining stability in terms of particle size distribution, morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties. This research establishes a robust framework for the scalable production of metal oxide nanoparticles with consistent properties, enhancing their viability for widespread use in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Using a Popular Titrating Agent: Aryl&#8208;Chlorides and &#8208;Fluorides Activation by the Diphenylacetic Acid Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cheap tool smoothly activates recalcitrant electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides by combining visible light irradiation with a popular titrating agent. The process generates in&#8208;situ aryl radicals, which can be then trapped forming a variety of new covalent bonds. The reductive method left untouched functional groups that have smaller reduction potentials than those of Ar&#8722;X bonds, opening the door to otherwise impossible synthetic strategies.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;chlorides and &#8208;fluorides are common building blocks, but their use in synthesis is limited by the high stability of their Ar&#8722;X bonds. The generation of aryl radicals via activation of strong Ar&#8722;X bonds is possible through the irradiation of tailor&#8208;made organic anions, which become reductants stronger than lithium metal. We report that the combination of visible light with the cheap diphenylacetic acid dianion is an even better tool, showing excellent activity across a variety of complex substrates and providing opportunities for late&#8208;stage drug modification. Ar&#8722;X bonds are chemoselectively activated in the presence of more easily reducible functions, such as Alk&#8208;Cl ones and carbonyl groups. These results pave the way to original synthetic strategies that would be otherwise considered impossible.

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism and Enhancing Selectivity of a RuII&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin Complex with RAFT&#8208;Generated Glycopolymer Exploiting Warburg Effect in Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ruthenium bis&#8208;bipyridyl complex of Morphocumin, a known photoactive lysosome targeting curcumin derivative has been encapsulated with glucose functionalized polymeric nanoparticle to exploit the Warburg effect in cancer. This nanomolar potent metal&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agent can achieve selectivity in pancreatic tumors upon encapsulation. In presence of excess H2O2 it can release Morphocumin in the tumor vicinity.







Abstract
The Warburg effect, which generates increased demand of glucose in cancer cells is a relatively underexplored phenomenon in existing commercial drugs to enhance uptake in cancer cells. Here, we present a chemotherapeutic strategy employing a Ru(II)&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin complex (2) encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembling glucose&#8208;functionalized copolymer P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) (where G=glucose; MMA=methyl methacrylate; EMA=ethyl methacrylate), designed to exploit this effect for enhanced selectivity in cancer treatment. The P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) polymer, synthesized via reversible&#8208;addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, has a number average molecular weight (Mn,NMR) of 8000&#8197;g/mol. Complex 2, stable in aqueous media, selectively releases a cytotoxic, lysosome&#8208;targeting compound, morphocumin, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevalent in tumor microenvironments. Additionally, complex 2 promotes ROS accumulation, which may further enhance morphocumin release through a synergistic domino effect. Comparative studies reveal that 2 outperforms its curcumin Ru(II) complex (1) analog in solution stability, organelle specificity, and cellular mechanisms. Both 1 and 2 exhibit phototherapeutic effects under low&#8208;intensity visible light, but their chemotoxicity significantly increases with incubation time in the dark, highlighting the superior chemotherapeutic efficacy of the O,O&#8208;coordinating Ru(II) ternary polypyridyl complexes. Complex 2 induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway and shows a 9&#8208;fold increase in selectivity for pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa&#8208;2) over non&#8208;cancerous HEK293 cells when encapsulated in the glucose&#8208;conjugated polymer (DP@2). Glucose deprivation in the culture medium further enhances drug efficacy by an additional 5&#8208;fold. This work underscores the potential of glucose&#8208;functionalized polymers and ROS&#8208;responsive Ru(II) complexes in targeted cancer therapy.

&lt;sub&gt;n,NMR&lt;/sub&gt;) of 8000&#8197;g/mol. Complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, stable in aqueous media, selectively releases a cytotoxic, lysosome-targeting compound, morphocumin, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevalent in tumor microenvironments. Additionally, complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; promotes ROS accumulation, which may further enhance morphocumin release through a synergistic domino effect. Comparative studies reveal that &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; outperforms its curcumin Ru(II) complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) analog in solution stability, organelle specificity, and cellular mechanisms. Both &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibit phototherapeutic effects under low-intensity visible light, but their chemotoxicity significantly increases with incubation time in the dark, highlighting the superior chemotherapeutic efficacy of the &lt;i&gt;O,O&lt;/i&gt;-coordinating Ru(II) ternary polypyridyl complexes. Complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; induces apoptosis &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the intrinsic pathway and shows a 9-fold increase in selectivity for pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2) over non-cancerous HEK293 cells when encapsulated in the glucose-conjugated polymer (&lt;b&gt;DP@2&lt;/b&gt;). Glucose deprivation in the culture medium further enhances drug efficacy by an additional 5-fold. This work underscores the potential of glucose-functionalized polymers and ROS-responsive Ru(II) complexes in targeted cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Dispersion of Xenes by Liquid Phase Exfoliation of Monoelemental Crystals in Melamine Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>

Bismouth, silicon, tellurium and tin powders are effectively exfoliated in water solution of melamine affording 2D nanostructures. These characteristic 2D Xenes are dispersed in water forming stable colloidal solutions.







Abstract
&#913;fter the impressive evolution of graphene and its derivatives, a large number of two dimensional (2D) materials with important optical and electrical properties have been successfully fabricated. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of layered and non&#8208;layered materials has become a widely applied method for the preparation of 2D nanostructures with an extensive variety of applications. However, in most cases organic solvents are used as liquid phase which are often toxic and environmentally unfriendly and lead to low yields. In this work, we present water as a suitable liquid phase and dispersion medium for the exfoliation of layered and non&#8208;layered monoelemental solids from IVA, VA and VIA groups of the periodic table, such as silicon, tin, bismuth and tellurium. The 2D nanostructures, silicene, stanene, bismuthene and tellurene are therefore prepared by a completely sustainable and environmentally friendly method. The prepared Xenes, as they are called, are fully characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.

         <title>Adsorption and Thermal Evolution of the Carbonyl&#8208;functionalized Ionic Liquid [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111): A Combined IRAS, STM, and DFT Study</title>

         <dc:description>
In solid catalysts with ionic liquid layers (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to modify noble mtal catalysts. The functionalised IL improves the SCILL by increasing the selectivity, with the functional group playing a crucial role in this process. To understand the mechanisms behind this selectivity control, we performed model studies using surface science techniques under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions.







Abstract
The coating of heterogeneous catalysts with ionic liquids enables precise tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity. Recently, the fundamentals of solid catalysts with ionic liquid layers have been extensively studied. So far, investigations have focused on simple ILs without specialized functional groups. In our current work, we aim to involve functionalized ILs to take advantage of the interactions between these functional groups, the catalyst, and the reactants. In this study, we investigated the interaction, and thermal stability of the carbonyl&#8208;functionalized IL [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111) by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. In addition, we performed density functional theory calculations to support our interpretation. At 200&#8197;K and low coverage, the carbonyl group of the [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im]+ cation is oriented parallel to the Pt(111) surface. With increasing coverage, the alkyl chain detaches from the surface and orients towards the vacuum. The [NTf2]&#8722; anion adsorbs parallel to the surface via the oxygen atoms of the SO2 groups. At higher coverage, at least one of the SO2 groups completely detaches from the surface. Upon heating to 250&#8197;K, we observe decomposition and partial desorption of [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2], with further decomposition and desorption occurring between 350 and 400&#8197;K.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of Stereospecific Self&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We take a look into the mechanism of glycosylation by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation. Despite these glycosylation taking place without any additives, a complex mechanistic pathway is revealed through both kinetic experiments, computational studies, and competition experiments.







Abstract
In this study, the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylations is extensively investigated through kinetic experiments, computational studies, and nucleophilic competition experiments. Based on the findings, the mechanism is proposed to be initiated by proton transfer from the acidic sulfonyl carbamate to the trichloroacetimidate, upon formation of an associated contact ion pair. This ion pair then collapses in an SN1&#8208;like fashion, with formation of an oxocarbeniumion&#8208;like intermediate. According to the proposed mechanism, stereospecificity arises from the associated nature of all intermediates formed throughout the reaction. During the mechanistic study, it was also found that the sulfonyl carbamates have catalytic properties if a competing nucleophile is present.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Defluorinative Etherification Between Unactivated Perfluoroarenes and Hydrobenzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using hydrobenzoxazoles as the surrogate of phenol, the first Pd(0) catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoaryl ethers motifs through selective C&#8722;F bond activation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage was described. This transformation proceeded under mild conditions, and exhibited broad substrate scope and ability for post&#8208;functionalization of natural products. DFT investigations suggested that oxidative addition step through C&#8722;F bond cleavage constitutes the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Polyfluoroaryl ethers represent an important framework of biologically active molecules and materials. Owing to the strong bond dissociation energy of C&#8722;F bond, selectivity and other issues, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ethers from perfluoroarenes via the activation of C&#8722;F bond is challenging and underdeveloped, as compared to the well&#8208;documented C&#8722;O bond formation starting from aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. Herein, an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative etherification for the synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ether skeletons using hydrobenzoxazoles as phenol surrogate, has been reported. The substrate scope for this protocol is broad, with respect to hydrobenzoxazoles and perfluoroarenes, under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, challenging alkenyl and alkynyl substituted polyfluoroarenes could be successfully used as the cou&#8208;pling component for Pd&#8208;catalyzed etherification reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the reaction mechanism, which suggested that oxidative addition between polyfluorobenzene and Pd(0) constituted the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Red Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Non&#8208;Aromatic Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;aromatic red organic room temperature phosphorescence with emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and succinic acid (SA) as precursors.







Abstract
Achieving red organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a significant challenge, especially in a non&#8208;aromatic system. Herein, red RTP with emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in non&#8208;aromatic carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The CPDs are synthesized via microwave method by using polyacrylic acid (PAA), succinic acid (SA), and traces of phosphoric acid as precursors. Small molecule SA can flexibly enter the polymer cluster of PAA and pair with the isolated carboxyl groups to form CDA. The intrinsic local carbonized structure formed in CPDs can effectively stabilize CDA to achieve red RTP. The red afterglow can last for 1&#8197;s to naked eye, and the corresponding lifetimes for emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm were 61 and 45&#8197;ms, respectively, after 365&#8197;nm excitation off. This work not only reported the non&#8208;aromatic red organic RTP materials for the first time, but also explored CPDs as an effective platform for achieving such non&#8208;aromatic long&#8208;wavelength RTP.

         <title>Reductive Aromatization of 5,7,12,14&#8208;Pentacenetetrone: Approach Towards Substituted Pentacenes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
5,7,12,14&#8208;Pentacenetetrone was functionalized via reductive aromatization strategy. The products were characterized by UV/Vis, CV, XRD, and discussed in relation to DFT methods. This method tends to yield partially reduced or over&#8208;reduced pentacene derivatives.







Abstract
Herein we report a convenient access to asymmetrically substituted, well soluble pentacene derivatives synthesized from commercially available 5,7,12,14&#8208;pentacenetetrone via reductive one step functionalization. Zinc or potassium are used as reducing agents and the reduced intermediates are trapped with electrophiles such as acetyl, triisopropylsilyl or cationic methyl synthons. The reduction allows for an unsymmetric functionalization whilst one dione moiety is maintained due to partial reduction. The resulting dyes are characterized by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Their redox potentials are studied by cyclic voltammetry. The experimentally determined molecular frontier orbital energies are rationalized by density functional theory. The spatial molecular packing motive in the solid state is studied as a function of the substituent size by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Attempts of reducing the second quinone moiety towards a functionalized pentacene led to an over&#8208;reduced 6,13&#8208;dihydropentacene derivative, which by means of an XRD structural analysis surprisingly displays a planar molecular conformation and unique optoelectronic properties.

Abstract
Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. First, the imine bonds in P12L24 were reduced to form an amine&#8208;based cage, r&#8208;P12L24, followed by carbamation using N,N&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to yield c&#8208;P12L24. The resulting carbamate cage exhibits high stability under acidic and basic conditions (pH&#8197;1&#8211;13) and in the presence of moisture. 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, and DFT calculations revealed that reducing the imine bonds to amine increases the framework's flexibility, causing partial structural collapse, whereas the carbamate formation restores structural rigidity. The insertion of a 4.0&#8197;nm molecular ruler into the cavity of zinc&#8208;metallated c&#8208;P12L24 via metal&#8208;ligand coordination further confirmed restoration of the cavity size and geometry of the original cage. This enhancement of chemical stability through carbamate formation can pave the way to a wide range of potential applications for the gigantic porphyrinic cage.

         <title>Proximity Effects and Aggregation of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor Barbiturate Host&#8211;Guest Complexes Probed by Cross&#8208;Metathesis and ESI MS Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8211;guest complexes (H&#8722;B) and their aggregates was studied using a two&#8208;step method, firstly covalent fixation via cross&#8208;metathesis (CM), followed by ESI MS analysis. This approach, using a cyclopentene&#8208;modified Hamilton receptor (H) and allyl&#8208;substituted barbital (B), confirmed the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded aggregates, both in solution and in bulk&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
The molecular environment around supramolecular bonding systems significantly affects their stability and the assembly of host&#8211;guest complexes, most prominent for hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8211;guest complexes are well&#8208;known in solution, typically forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio complex. However, within a polymer matrix, these complexes can form higher&#8208;order assemblies, deviating from the standard 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex, which are challenging to characterize and often require lab&#8208;intensive methods. In this study, a novel Hamilton receptor (H) was equipped with cyclopentene moieties and used as a host to form host&#8211;guest complexes (H&#8722;B) with allobarbital (B), followed by covalent crosslinking. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy titration experiments in different solvents and at various temperatures revealed that polar solvents containing additional H&#8208;bonding sites significantly reduce the formation of the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 H&#8722;B complex, as indicated by a reduced association constant. Higher&#8208;order aggregates (HH&#8208;dimer, HHH&#8208;trimer) were subsequently detected via an alkene cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) reaction to fix the assemblies covalently, followed by analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). This two&#8208;step method, firstly via CM fixation followed by ESI MS, was extended to study the H&#8722;B model complex within a polyisobutylene (PIB) matrix, presenting a direct method to analyze the complex host&#8211;guest assembly in solvent&#8208;free (polymer) environments.

         <title>Ni2+ in Distorted Octahedral Geometry toward High&#8208;Efficiency NIR&#8208;II/III emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>

The LaTiTaO6: Ni2+ phosphor synthesized via the solid&#8208;phase method exhibits an external quantum yield (EQY) of 9.00&#8201;%, which is the highest reported value for singly Ni2+&#8208;doped phosphors to date. The higher EQY is attributed to Ni2+ being situated in octahedral lattice sites with significant distortion, thus enhancing the absorption efficiency. Finally, the potential application of this phosphor in material analysis is demonstrated.







Abstract
Ni2+ activated phosphor has attracted wide attention because it can be radiated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) II&#8211;III region; however, the low external quantum yield (EQY) hinders its further application (most are below 8&#8201;%). In this work, distortion of crystallographic site strategy is proposed to enhance EQY. LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ exhibits an NIR emitting spectrum centered at 1450&#8197;nm with an EQY of ~9.00&#8201;%, which has been the highest EQY of reported Ni2+ single&#8208;doped phosphor. Distortion degrees of the octahedral geometry in LaTiTaO6 and LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ changing from 0.038 to 0.047 result in the absorption efficiency of 38.6&#8201;% due to the breaking of parity forbidden of the d&#8208;d transition, further improving the EQY. Besides, LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ mixed with LaTiTaO6: 0.04Cr3+ phosphors have demonstrated their application for spectral analysis. This work provides a new idea for constructing efficient NIR&#8208;II to NIR&#8208;III phosphors.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Vinyl Sulfones by Direct C&#8722;S Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for the synthesis of polysubstituted vinylsulfones under mild conditions was developed to promote a selective, post&#8208;synthetic integration of molecular diversity, which should expedite the discovery of new medicines.







Abstract
Vinyl sulfones are valued for their unique chemical properties and bioactivity, but creating a wide range of different analogs remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel approach that facilitates the synthesis of polysubstituted vinyl sulfones. This method utilizes the dual functionality of NIS as a promoter that enables sulfonation and elimination in the synthesis of vinyl sulfones. We used the broad applicability, efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance of this approach to synthesize more than 70 examples. Additionally, competition experiments have provided insights into the reactivity and selectivity of the transient sulfonyl radical towards various C&#8722;C multiple bonds. Herein, we describe using this mild protocol in the late&#8208;stage vinyl sulfonation of complex molecules to simplify the synthesis of specific targets and enable the modification of complex natural products and advanced materials.

         <title>Quenching Rate Constants of Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radical by Substrates: a Laser Flash Photolysis Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction rate constants of a Lewis base&#8208;boryl radical, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8226;, with several methyl chlorobenzoates and chlorinated acetanilides are measured. Compared with the abstraction of the chlorine atom, the radical&#8208;addition to the carbonyl oxygen atom is more favorable as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole reaction.







Abstract
The advanced strategy using Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBRs) has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full&#8208;carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8901; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro&#8208;substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, kq, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate&#8208;determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.

         <title>Nucleophilic Amination of Aryl Halides with an Azanide Surrogate</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the conversion of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines by using an anionic amidine nucleophile as an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.







Abstract
We report the development of an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate which enables the facile conversion of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The designed amidine reagent is easy to prepare, bench stable, and undergoes facile N&#8208;arylation under basic conditions at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Intermediate N&#8208;aryl amidines are readily cleaved to form N&#8208;aryl amines in&#8197;situ through hydrolysis or base&#8208;promoted elimination. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Encapsulated NHCs: Increased Selectivity and Reactivity of CO2 in Amine Formylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) in cyclodextrins (CDs) allows the organocatalytic formylation of amines. The presence of a cavity enables substrate&#8208;selectivity, based on the steric bulk around the amine, without any loss of reactivity.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) organocatalyst in the cavity of cyclodextrins (CDs). These confined organocatalysts allow the formylation of amines through CO2 hydrosilylation. The presence of the cavity of the CDs leads to substrate&#8208;selectivity between amines in competition reactions. The use of the smallest &#945;&#8208;CD induces the best selectivities but also increased reactivity compared to the bigger &#946;&#8208;CD. A careful study conducted by NMR and DFT revealed that in &#945;&#8208;CD, the complexed CO2 interacts with the cavity through hydrogen bonds. These H&#8208;bonds destabilize the NHC&#8211;CO2 adduct and are accountable for the higher reactivity observed using &#945;&#8208;CD.

These confined organocatalysts allow the formylation of amines through CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrosilylation. The presence of the cavity of the CDs leads to substrate-selectivity between amines in competition reactions. The use of the smallest &#945;-CD induces the best selectivities but also increased reactivity compared to the bigger &#946;-CD. A careful study conducted by NMR and DFT revealed that in &#945;-CD, the complexed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interacts with the cavity through hydrogen bonds. These H-bonds destabilize the NHC&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adduct and are accountable for the higher reactivity observed using &#945;-CD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emission&#8208;Tunable B&#8592;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three structurally distinct double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot method that involved sequential electrophilic borylation and in situ functionalization. The borylation position and substituents on the boron atoms significantly affect the structure and optoelectronic properties, enabling tunable fluorescence from cyan to red (509&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and reducing the LUMO energy level to &#8722;3.12&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Herein, we simultaneously synthesized three different double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes including the asymmetric BNNY and BNNO and the mirror&#8208;symmetric BNNR, via a one&#8208;pot method. The annulation modes of the B&#8592;N Lewis pairs and the substituents on the boron atoms efficiently tune the molecular frontier orbitals and emission colors. &#945;&#8208;Position fusion leads to a significant enhancement of the HOMO energy level and a decrease in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups attached to the boron atom make the LUMO energy level more stable. In particular, the LUMO energy level of BNNO is as low as &#8722;3.12&#8197;eV. BNNY, BNNO, and BNNR emit cyan, green, and red fluorescence at 509, 534, and 620&#8197;nm, respectively, with fluorescence quantum yields of 24&#8201;%, 49&#8201;%, and 30&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Dispersion Forces&#8208;Driven Hierarchical Assembly of Protein&#8208;Like Lanthanide Octamers and Emergent CPL</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that solvent conformation adaptation enhanced dispersion forces drive the hierarchical assembly of the trinuclear circular helicate into protein&#8208;like supramolecular octamers, exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is a prevalent strategy employed by nature to construct sophisticated biomacromolecules, such as proteins. However, the construction of protein&#8208;like superstructures that rely on weaker dispersion forces&#8208;driven hierarchical assembly remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the first example of dispersion forces driving the high&#8208;order assembly of the lanthanide trinuclear circular helicate [HNEt&#8323;]&#8323;[Eu&#8323;(LL)&#8326;] (&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1) into a protein&#8208;like lanthanide octamer ((&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1)&#8328;&#8208;2). Within the octamer, the forty&#8208;eight (48) menthol groups on the ligands and eighty&#8208;four (84) 1,4&#8208;dioxane solvent molecules contribute to enhanced dispersion forces through conformational adaptation and size&#8208;matching effects. These enhanced dispersion forces not only drive the formation of the hierarchical superstructure but also result in a four&#8208;level chirality transfer from the menthol to the octamer. Benefiting from the homochirality of Eu3+, the octamer is endowed the strong circularly polarized emission (|glum|=0.34, &#934;overall=41&#8201;%). This understanding of how dispersion forces drive hierarchical self&#8208;assembly provides a foundation for the directed fabrication of more fascinating superstructures.

We present a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes. This approach efficiently forms various aminocyclobutane esters and amides, incorporating N&#8208;nucleophiles like imidazoles, azoles, and nucleobase derivatives resulting in enhanced molecular diversity for medicinal chemistry applications.







Abstract
Herein, we present a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from commercially available bromocyclobutanes.

Notably, N&#8208;nucleophiles such as imidazoles, azoles, and nucleobase derivatives were successfully incorporated, enhancing the chemical diversity of small ring building blocks for medicinal chemistry applications.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Chloride&#8208;Dependent Uncaging Reaction of Propargyl and Allene&#8208;Protected Substrates by Pd&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the impact of chloride ions, this study highlights the high performance of a Pd(II) complex in the deallenylation uncaging reaction of an allene&#8208;protected fluorophore and a chemotherapeutic drug. The Pd complex demonstrated superior performance in high chloride concentrations, while the novel Alle&#8208;5&#8208;Fluorouracil prodrug was effectively activated at low concentrations of the Pd complex, underscoring its potential for targeted drug activation in cancer therapy.







Abstract
This study investigates the effect of chloride levels on the mode of action of palladium complexes for the activation of propargyl&#8208; and allene&#8208;protected fluorophores and chemotherapeutic drugs through uncaging reactions. Four Pd(II) complexes were synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques to confirm their structure and electronic properties. Kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations revealed that chloride ions in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) significantly enhance catalytic efficiency, particularly for allenyl&#8208;protected substrates compared to propargylic counterparts. This enhancement is attributed to the neutral charge nature of the Pd complex. The data suggest that neutral complexes are less prone to chloride exchange by water molecules. Additionally, chloride ligands counterbalance the unusually high stability of the key &#963;&#8208;bound &#951;1&#8208;Pd intermediates in the aquo complexes in PB, leading to an overall higher reactivity. These results highlight the impact of fine&#8208;tuning the electronic properties of the metal center through both designed ligands and environmental factors. Bench evaluations and tests with living breast cancer cells demonstrated that a Pd catalyst complex with a bidentate ligand effectively activates the prodrugs propargyl&#8208;5&#8208;fluorouracil (Prop&#8208;5FU) and allene&#8208;5&#8208;Fluorouracil (Alle&#8208;5FU), the latter being a novel prodrug. The Pd catalyst successfully released the active drug, inducing significant cytotoxicity, especially with Alle&#8208;5FU, which operates at lower catalyst concentrations than Pro&#8208;5FU.

         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;free method has been developed for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl substituted isothioureas via three&#8208;component ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic sulfonium salts with isothiocyanates and amines. A series of aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl sulfonium salts were successfully transformed into the S&#8208;alkyl substituted isothioureas in moderate to excellent yields with favorable functional group tolerance. The advantages of operational simplicity, broad substrate scope, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and good reaction efficiency make this protocol attractive in the synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
A convenient and base&#8208;free three&#8208;component reaction has been developed for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl substituted isothioureas from cyclic sulfonium salts, isothiocyanates, and amines. This protocol provides an alternative avenue to access a series of S&#8208;alkyl substituted isothioureas in moderate to good yields through ring&#8208;opening reaction of aryl, alkenyl and alkynyl sulfonium salts. The present strategy features operational simplicity, good functional group tolerance, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and high reaction efficiency.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystals for the Sensitive Detection of Visible Light and X&#8208;Rays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free MA3Bi2I9 single crystals with high anisotropy is developed to fabricate photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors with a low detection limit. Detectors perpendicular to the {001} crystal plane exhibit better weak light detection capabilities compared to devices parallel to the {001} crystal plane.







Abstract
The excellent performance and facile fabrication process of perovskite semiconductor materials make them highly promising candidates in the field of optoelectronic devices. Whether for visible light or X&#8208;rays, detectors with low detection limits can better identify weak light signals, significantly reducing the intensity of the received light source during device operation. In particular, for X&#8208;ray detectors, reducing X&#8208;ray dosage can greatly enhance the safety of X&#8208;ray imaging technology. This work develops detectors with low detection limit based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MA3Bi2I9 single crystals. The anisotropy of MA3Bi2I9 and its influence on the detector&#8216;s performance were investigated in detail. Detectors perpendicular to the (001) crystal plane have better weak light detection capability and require significantly less light intensity compared to devices parallel to the (001) crystal plane. X&#8208;ray detector with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.68&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and sensitivity of 5072&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was obtained. The present study offers comprehensive insights into the operational mechanism of layered perovskites, which can provide valuable guidelines for future designs and fabrications of highly sensitive photo and X&#8208;ray detectors.

A highly efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal (3+3) and (3+2) cycloaddition reactions of isatin&#8208;derived tertiary propargylic esters with N,N&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, respectively has been realized. This approach facilitates the formation of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;pyran and furan scaffolds, each incorporating an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal (3+3) and (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of isatin&#8208;derived tertiary propargylic esters with N,N&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, respectively. In this process, the tertiary propargylic ester serves as both C3&#8208; and C2&#8208;synthons, facilitating the synthesis of optically active spirooxindole&#8208;pyran and furan scaffolds featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The reaction delivers these spirocyclic frameworks in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Additionally, the scalability of both the reactions and the transformation of chiral intermediates into valuable structures emphasize the synthetic and practical importance of this strategy.

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
What determines the stability of iodide double perovskite compounds and our ability to synthesize them? Despite being highly sought after, not a lot is known about this rare compositional family. We present the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of two iodide double perovskites containing small trivalent ions, and employ design rules for perovskites, coupled with electronic structure calculations, to understand stability limits.







Abstract
While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10&#8197;eV [M(III)&#8201;=&#8201;Sc] and 3.65&#8197;eV [M(III)&#8201;=&#8201;Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskites based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Development of Bifunctional Cyclooctenes as Active, Practical, and Light&#8208;Gated Bromination Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic studies guided the development of bifunctional trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group. TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group is particularly active, and the functionalization allowed more practical cis&#8208;cyclooctenes (CCOs) to be used as active catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.







Abstract
Most molecular catalysts have been developed employing polar functional groups as catalytic sites. However, the use of non&#8208;polar functional groups for catalysis has received less attention due to their modest molecular interactions while the bioorthogonal reactivity of non&#8208;polar alkenes as substrates is frequently used in click chemistry. In this study, we conducted mechanistic studies on the catalysis of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives with the strained olefin as the catalytic site using kinetic and computational analyses to aid the design of more active olefin catalysts. The analysis reveals the significant role of the benzyl substituents in accelerating the generation of bromonium species through dispersion interaction in the rate&#8208;determining step.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic studies guided the development of bifunctional &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene (TCO) catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group. TCO with a &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxybenzyl group is particularly active, and the functionalization allowed more practical &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctenes (CCOs) to be used as active catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light-gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most molecular catalysts have been developed employing polar functional groups as catalytic sites. However, the use of non-polar functional groups for catalysis has received less attention due to their modest molecular interactions while the bioorthogonal reactivity of non-polar alkenes as substrates is frequently used in click chemistry. In this study, we conducted mechanistic studies on the catalysis of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives with the strained olefin as the catalytic site using kinetic and computational analyses to aid the design of more active olefin catalysts. The analysis reveals the significant role of the benzyl substituents in accelerating the generation of bromonium species through dispersion interaction in the rate-determining step. Guided by the mechanistic insights, we developed bifunctional TCO catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group, taking advantage of the remarkable substituent effects. Experimental studies confirmed the theoretical model and revealed that TCO with a &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxybenzyl group provided excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, inclusion of the functionalized benzyl groups allowed more readily available and robust &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctenes to be used as active catalysts, expanding the practical utility of the olefin catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light-gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistical Study on Substrate&#8208;Controlled Highly Selective [2+2] and [2+3] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the same precursor molecules, the substrate&#8208;controlled high&#8208;selective cycloaddition reactions towards non&#8208;benzenoid carbon rings are successfully achieved. The yield towards four&#8208;membered carbon rings via [2+2] cycloaddition reaction is 97&#8201;% on Au(111), while the yield towards five&#8208;membered carbon rings via [2+3] cycloaddition reaction is 96&#8201;% on Ag(111).







Abstract
Polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons have acquired increased interests recently because of their potential applications in electronic devices. On metal surfaces, the selective synthesis of four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings remains challenging due to the presence of diverse reaction pathways. Here, utilizing the same precursor molecule, we successfully achieved substrate&#8208;controlled highly selective cycloaddition reactions towards four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings. A 97&#8201;% yield for four&#8208;membered carbon rings on Au(111), while a 96&#8201;% yield towards five&#8208;membered carbon rings is achieved on Ag(111). The detailed topological structures of the reaction products are carefully examined by bond&#8208;resolving scanning tunneling microscopy (BR&#8208;STM) imaging with a CO functionalized tip. The underlying mechanism of the novel surface&#8208;directed reaction selectivity is elucidated by extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study paves the way for high selective synthesis of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons with non&#8208;benzenoid rings.

         <title>Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Tricycles: Maximizing Stability by Constraint</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A challenge in drug discovery is creating peptides that are sufficiently stable. By progressively increasing structural constraint through macrocyclization chemistry in combination with bismuth binding &#8211; from linear to cyclic, bicyclic, and finally tricyclic peptides &#8211; we greatly enhance peptide stability without compromising activity. This yields bismuth&#8211;peptide tricycles that remain stable at cellular glutathione concentrations and in plasma.







Abstract
Constrained peptides possess excellent properties for identifying lead compounds in drug discovery. While it has become increasingly straightforward to discover selective high&#8208;affinity peptide ligands, especially through genetically encoded libraries, their stability and bioavailability remain significant challenges. By integrating macrocyclization chemistry with bismuth binding, we generated series of linear, cyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic peptides with identical sequences. Utilizing bismuth to rigidify the peptide structure allows for a better comparison of different constraint levels, reducing confounding effects of interactions often seen with hydrophobic stapling reagents. Our study facilitated the identification of a peptide&#8211;bismuth tricycle that fully withstands cellular levels of glutathione, acts as a nanomolar protease inhibitor without being proteolytically digested by its target, and is fully stable in human plasma. Importantly, this multicyclic peptide does not possess any non&#8208;canonical amino acid modifications. Using oxime ligation, we conjugated an analogue of this tricycle to the N&#8208;terminus of two nanobodies to demonstrate potential applications in targeted therapy.

         <title>Isolation of a Staudinger&#8208;type Intermediate Utilizing a Five&#8208;Membered Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Biradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping transient Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates. The reaction of five&#8208;membered biradicaloids with azides (e.&#8201;g.&#160;Dipp&#8208;N3) leads to a variety of reaction pathways. Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates can be isolated directly from the reaction mixture (without loss of N2) if specific time or temperature control is applied. SCXRD, low&#8208;temperature NMR studies and calculations help to understand under which conditions addition or Staudinger type reaction takes place.







Abstract
The Staudinger reaction provides chemists with a valuable tool for the reduction of azides, which are notoriously unstable and can decompose explosively. By providing a controlled method for the conversion of azides to amines, the reaction opened up new avenues for the synthesis of various amine&#8208;containing compounds that are widely used in natural products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The Staudinger reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of a trivalent phosphine (usually triphenylphosphine), leading to the formation of a triazenide intermediate, a highly reactive species. Here we report how a divalent phosphorus&#8208;centered biradicaloid reacts with covalent azides and show that it is possible to capture and fully characterize the transient intermediate. The experimental data is supported by quantum chemical calculations of the reaction paths and in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a boron&#8208;driven ortho&#8208;arylation reaction of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. This novel method enables directed borylation of a wide range of substrates, leading to the synthesis of unique compounds such as N&#8208;doped fulminene and diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines. These compounds hold significant promise for applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
The synthesis of biaryl amides, which are prevalent motifs in bioactive molecules, often necessitates lengthy and inefficient procedures. To address these limitations, catalytic C&#8722;H activation protocols have emerged, enabling the direct ortho&#8208;arylation of aryl amides. However, these protocols often suffer from issues such as lack of selectivity, reliance on stoichiometric oxidants, and the requirement for excess reagents and harsh reaction conditions. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel and highly selective protocol for the ortho&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. The high selectivity originates from the directed installation of BBr3 to form a boracycle, which then undergoes cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl halide. Our method offers significant advantages, including mild reaction conditions, excellent site&#8208;specificity, and scalability. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with a diverse range of readily accessible functionalized anilides and aryl iodides, as evidenced by 55 successful examples yielding products in the 30&#8211;95&#8201;% range. Furthermore, our methodology surpasses conventional approaches by facilitating the one&#8208;pot selective diagonal diarylation of dianilides. This capability unlocks the construction of previously unattainable diagonal aryl systems, which serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;doped fulminenes, two crucial compound classes in materials science.

         <title>Olikomycin A&#8211;A Novel Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide with Antibiotic Activity Against Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deletion of pleiotropic regulatory gene wblA in S. ghanaensis ATCC 14672 activated a novel biosynthetic gene cluster, producing Olikomycin A, a cyclic lipopeptide synthesized by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases. In the presence of calcium, it shows promising activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208; and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, inducing cell death by disrupting cell membrane integrity through a yet unknown mechanism.







Abstract
Research into new antibiotics is becoming increasingly important as antibiotic resistance increases worldwide. The genus Streptomyces in particular is able to produce a wide range of antimicrobial products due to the large number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in its genome. However, not all BGCs are expressed under laboratory conditions. In this work, deletion of the gene wblA, encoding a global regulator of natural product biosynthesis and morphogenesis in Streptomyces, led to the production of a novel natural product, olikomycin A, in Streptomyces ghanaensis ATCC 14672. Complete structure elucidation revealed that olikomycin A belongs to a class of calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics known as non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)&#8208;encoded acidic lipopeptides. These compounds exhibit remarkable antimicrobial activity in the presence of calcium. Insights into olikomycin A biosynthesis were provided by whole genome sequencing and gene inactivation studies, while bioactivity assays showed strong inhibition of the growth of multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens via disrupting cell membrane integrity. Olikomycin A shows an antibiotic profile similar to that of daptomycin, which is already in clinical use.

         <title>Cover Feature: Proximity Effects and Aggregation of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor Barbiturate Host&#8211;Guest Complexes Probed by Cross&#8208;Metathesis and ESI MS Analysis (Chem. Eur. J. 8/2025)</title>

         <dc:description>
The Hamilton receptor (H) forms a 1:1 complex (H&#8722;B) in solution with barbiturate (B) via sextuple hydrogen bonds. Although such interactions are well characterized in solution, they reorganize in solvent&#8208;free environment, further modulated by factors such as temperature and polarity profiles. We have developed a two&#8208;step method to characterize hydrogen&#8208;bonding association in solvent&#8208;free environments by 1)&#8197;covalent fixation through cross&#8208;metathesis and 2)&#8197;structural analysis by using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS). Model molecules H, B and their complex H&#8722;B were first fixed by cross&#8208;metathesis (&#8220;red stapler&#8221;), then analyzed by ESI&#8208;MS to confirm their structures. The ball&#8208;and&#8208;stick molecular models, with varying transparency, enhance contrast to highlight major molecules, while arrows guide the reader through the interpretation. The red stapler symbolizes covalent fixation, and the ion sprayer, alongside a representative MS spectrum, illustrates the precision of the ESI&#8208;MS analysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by W.&#8197;H. Binder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403939).

         <title>Cross&#8208;Transition&#8208;Dipole Stacking of Conjugated Organic Molecules: Structure, Exciton Behavior and Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;transition&#8208;dipole stacking enables weak exciton coupling, leads to exciton localization, and induces chirality in organic solids, which emerged as a unique molecular stacking mode for enhanced optoelectronic properties. This mini&#8208;review offers an in&#8208;depth insight and perspective in this packing mode.







Abstract
Organic conjugated molecules have gained widespread application as organic semiconductors due to their unique optoelectronic properties. The rigidity of these large conjugated structures facilitates strong intermolecular interactions, which significantly influence their properties in the solid state through various molecular arrangements. The study of the relationship among molecular arrangement, exciton behavior, and optoelectronic properties is an eternal research topic. Cross&#8208;dipole stacking is a specific molecular arrangement that demonstrates unique characteristics and has received continuous attention over the past decades. This mini&#8208;review will first discuss the unique exciton behaviors in cross&#8208;dipole stacking based on exciton models, including weak exciton coupling and suppression of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These exciton behaviors, determined by molecular stacking arrangements, are fundamental to the optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems. Next, we will introduce well&#8208;defined cross&#8208;dipole systems and summarize their design principles from a molecular structure perspective. Finally, we will present the specific optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems and their outstanding performance, such as high solid&#8208;state luminescence, good charge carrier mobility, and significant CD/CPL. Through this mini&#8208;review, we hope to enhance the understanding of cross&#8208;dipole stacking, contributing to the construction of such systems, the exploration of excited&#8208;state behaviors, and the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Ammonia/Amine Boranes and Related Transformations Catalysed by Group 4 Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarises developments in the field of dehydrocoupling and dehydropolymerisation of amine boranes, as well as transfer hydrogenation using amine&#8208;boranes as reagents, catalysed by complexes of group 4 metals. We highlight reactivity trends and reaction mechanisms using representative examples and discuss potential further research directions in the field.







Abstract
Ammonia borane and amine boranes are main group analogues of alkanes, which are characterised by their large gravimetric hydrogen content. This hydrogen can be released in dehydrocoupling and dehydropolymerisation reactions to obtain B&#8722;N oligomers and polymers that are of importance as precursors for functional B&#8722;N materials. Furthermore, amine boranes are potent reagents for application in transfer hydrogenation reactions, representing a versatile, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to the use of gaseous hydrogen for the reduction of organic compounds. Compared to late transition metals, complexes of readily available and comparatively inexpensive electropositive group 4 metals have been used to a much lesser extent. This review summarises the developments in the field of dehydrocoupling of amine boranes and transfer hydrogenation with these reagents, catalysed by complexes of group 4 metals. We analyse the background for these developments using examples and reaction mechanisms and provide an outlook for future developments in this field of research.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Phosphates: A New Alternative to Conventional Borates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 8, February 6, 2025. </description>

Old Tree Blossoms Anew: The recent discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, which demonstrates a remarkable SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP), has reignited interest in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated deep ultraviolet (DUV) transparent nonlinear optical (NLO) phosphates. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in DUV&#8208;transparent NLO phosphates and offers valuable insights into potential future directions for research in this field.







Abstract
Deep ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with balanced performance are crucial for extending laser wavelengths into the DUV region, essential for various laser applications. However, developing ideal DUV crystals is challenging due to stringent requirements: strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, short cut&#8208;off wavelength, and effective phase&#8208;matching behavior. DUV NLO borates, which feature &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, have garnered attention for their higher SHG coefficients compared to phosphates. However, phosphates typically show short UV cut&#8208;off edges due to the large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (approximately 9.6&#8197;eV) of the [PO&#8324;] units. To enhance the SHG effect while maintaining DUV transparency in phosphates, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using distorted polymerized P&#8722;O groups like isolated C&#8321;&#8208;[P&#8323;O&#8321;&#8320;]&#8309;&#8722; and [P&#8322;O&#8327;]&#8308;&#8722;; 2) aligning isolated [PO&#8324;]3&#8722; tetrahedra along the polar screw axis; 3) introducing additional NLO&#8208;active units; and 4) exploring new units derived from [PO&#8324;]3&#8722;, such as [PO&#8323;F]2&#8722; tetrahedra. These strategies have led to the successful development of various non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphates, highlighting their potential as DUV NLO candidates. This review explores the relationship between their crystal structures and DUV NLO performance, and proposes future directions for developing ideal DUV NLO materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient and practical protocol for the generation of halogen (Br and Cl) radicals using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. The NXS/TBHP reagent systems are demonstrated for site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. It is shown that the reagent system permits regioselective halogenation at the C7 position of the benzene core over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions. We further show that terminal alkynes can be converted to gem&#8208;dihaloketones in a facile manner by NXS/TBHP. Mechanistically, single electron transfer between TBHP and NXS leads to instantaneous formation of electrophilic halogen radicals, which attack arenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Implicating the Role of Au&#8208;H Bonds in Photochemical N2 Fixation by Ruthenium Doped Gold Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen fixation through the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) under mild conditions without the use of sacrificial agents has its share of formidable hurdles. It has been shown recently that Ru&#8208;doped Au nanoclusters can reduce N2 molecule to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium. Herein, using theoretical techniques (Density Functional Theory) we shed light on the mechanistic avenues traversed for achieving this prodigious chemical feat. Our findings suggest that the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster successfully accomplishes the NRR process under ambient pressure and temperature conditions by the very virtue of its bifunctional nature. Contrary to the existing views, we find that NRR propagates through an alternative associative pathway, where the Ru dopant assists in N2 adsorption while the Au&#8208;H bonds formed from Au assisted water splitting is implicated for facilitating NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural, Physicochemical, and Biological Insights into Novel (Acetylacetonate)(Oxydiacetato)Oxidovanadium(IV) Complexes with N&#8208;containing Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structures of three novel oxidovanadium(IV) salts containing the [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8208; anion (acac = acetylacetonate, oda = oxydiacetate) and quinolinium ([QH]+), isoquinolinium ([(isoQ)H+) and acridinium ([(acr)H+)] counterions, of molecular formulas [QH][VO(acac)(oda)] (1), [(isoQ)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O) (2) and [(acr)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O)2 (3) are reported. Notably, these complexes represent the first structurally characterized salts comprising the heteroligand [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8208; complex anion. A comprehensive physicochemical characterization of the complexes in both solid state and solution is provided, with general discussions on the role of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds on the structure of the resulting ternary oxidovanadium(IV) complexes. The experimental results were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate possible ligand conformations in the coordination sphere of V(IV). In addition, the nature of the bonds involved in the chelation of the vanadium(IV) cation is considered and a detailed assessment of the electron spin density is presented. Finally, the cytotoxic activity of the compounds was tested against breast (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7) cancer cell lines to assess their potential use as chemotherapeutic agents in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Revision and Total Synthesis of Primarolides A and B via Massarinin A as a Common Precursor &#8211; Discovery of a Surprising 1,4&#8208;Aryl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To probe the possible non&#8208;enzymatic formation of the polyketidic fungal metabolites primarolides A and B, the supposed 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone precursor was prepared by chemical synthesis exploiting an anionic homo&#8208;Fries rearrangement to set up the highly substituted benzophenone unit. Conversion of this compound into the putative primarolides (i.e. the isomeric phthalide and the correspon&#8208;ding N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;isoindolinone) revealed that the proposed structures had to be revised. Subsequently, the natural product massarinin A, which displays a similar 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone substructure, was synthesized following a related strategy. Treatment of massarinin A with Sc(OTf)3 or cyanide as a nucleophilic catalyst unexpectedly proceeded under 1,4&#8208;aryl migration to afford primarolide A. In contrast, reaction of massarinin A with aniline gave rise to primarolide B without aryl shift. All structural assignments were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis and the proposed mechanism of the skeletal rearrangement was supported by 13C labeling. The study not only led to the total synthesis and structural revision of the primarolides but also supports the hypothesis of their non&#8208;enzymatic formation as racemates under the reported fermentation conditions, with the added suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) likely serving as the source of aniline.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the role of the D&#8208;cluster in [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum contains [4Fe4S] clusters that allow electron transfer from the buried active sites to the protein surface. Among them, the role of the D&#8208;cluster, located at the dimer interface is still not fully understood. In this study, the removal of the D&#8208;cluster by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed remarkable features in the behavior of the enzyme. Quantitative analysis and spectroscopic studies unveiled the suppression of D&#8208;cluster in the mutants and the influence on other metal cofactors. Furthermore, the CO oxidation activity in solution measured in the presence of methylviologen is almost completely abolished in the mutants. Conversely, direct electrochemistry at a functionalized carbon nanotube electrode shows that the mutants are still catalytically active reaching reduced but significant current densities of 0.7 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the electroenzymatic activity towards oxygen is not affected by the removal of the D cluster. EPR studies reveal a remarkable change in the magnetic coupling between FeS clusters upon removal of the D&#8208;cluster, highlighting the effect of the location of this D&#8208;cluster at the dimer interface. It is noteworthy that in addition to its role as electron relay, the D&#8208;cluster appears to play an important role in the biosynthesis of the active site.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral N&#8208;Alkylfluorenyl&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes in the Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of chiral A*Flu&#8208;NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes, where A*Flu&#8208;NHC is an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) bearing a chiral 9&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenyl N&#8208;substituent and a 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or benzyl N&#8217;&#8208;substituent, were straightforward prepared in few steps from readily available 2,6&#8208;diisopropylamine, imidazole or benzimidazole. The chirality of the N&#8208;substituent lies in the presence of a chiral alcoholic alkyl chain on the fluorenyl, which results from the opening of commercially available chiral styrene oxide, yielding to a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethyl or a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group. Four [AuCl(A*Flu&#8208;NHC)] complexes were tested as precatalysts in an enantioselective cycloisomerization of a 1,6&#8208;enyne. Notably, the best inductions were observed with the benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derivative bearing a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group on the fluorenyl ring, showing that a constrained rotation around the N&#8208;Cfluorenyl bond and a chiral center in &#945; position of the fluorenyl ring are determining factors. Interestingly, a strong improvement of the induction with up to 72% ee was observed using AgOTf as activator. The presence of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and OTf&#8208; in the in situ generated active cationic gold(I) species probably stiffens its structure. This type of ligand&#8208;counteranion interaction represents a novel strategy for optimizing chirality transfer in asymmetric gold(I) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene (N&#8208;HTA) with diaminotriazinyl groups to guide the self&#8208;assembly through directional hydrogen bonding. Mass spectrometry collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments indicated the formation of multiply charged clusters in the gas phase. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that the solid state packing is governed by an interplay between the hydrogen bonding and the solvent system used for crystallization. The self&#8208;assembly on both semiconducting and insulating surfaces upon simple drop&#8208;casting was disclosed by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. The strong hydrogen bonding leads to robust self&#8208;assembly on surfaces, which can be conveniently achieved by simple solution processing techniques under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Synthesis of Copper Nanoparticles utilising the Maillard Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new approach for the fabrication of copper nanoparticles by a wet chemical reduction method is reported. The natural resources arginine as amino compound and several monosaccharides (xylose, ribose, galactose and glucose) react characteristically performing an Amadori rearrangement followed by a Maillard type reaction. This reaction carried out in an aqueous solution ensures an environmentally friendly way to reduce copper(II) ions leading to the formation of the desired nanoparticles. By changing the concentration of the amino acid, simultaneously acting as a complexing agent, it is possible to tune the size of the resulting nano particles to a certain degree down to 3 nm. This nontoxic and facile preparation route with quantitative yield opens a wide field of applications ranging from electronics to medical approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Interactions in Coulombic Associated Photoactive Macrocycles to Chemically Modified MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst functionalization of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and more specifically MoS2, has flourished the past decade, the accommodation of photoactive molecules on their lattice has unlocked the potentiality of this family of materials in a series of optoelectronic and energy related applications. The electronic communication between the chromophore and MoS2, in such systems, has been thoroughly studied, in cases where the grafting of the former on the latter is secured through covalent bonding. However, comparatively less attention has been drawn in cases where the chromophore is electrostatically anchored on MoS2, a means that potentially provides alternative ways of spatially accommodating the ligand on the TMD&#8217;s extended environment, which directly affects the electronic communication between the two entities. In this work, we comparatively study the photophysical characteristics of three separate nanoensembles, where MoS2 is electrostatically hosting a Zn&#8208;phthalocyanine, a Zn&#8208;porphyrin, and a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene, that complementary cover a wide range of visible absorption, via UV&#8208;Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results highlight the strong interactions in the excited state across all chromophores, while the ground&#8208;state interactions vary from chromophore to chromophore, indicating a distinct energy exchange dependent on the specific nanoensemble.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Organic Scintillators with High Exciton Utilization Efficiency for X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic scintillators have rapidly emerged in recent years for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging, benefiting from their inherent advantages of abundant raw materials, low&#8208;temperature processing, high mechanical flexibility, and easy of large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, conventional organic scintillators suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and inefficient exciton utilization, limiting their commercial viability. To overcome these challenges, new&#8208;generation organic scintillators have recently been developed with innovative emission mechanisms to ensure exciton utilization efficiency and the incorporation of heavy atoms to improve X&#8208;ray absorption. In recent years, these advancements have led to remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. Here, we present a concept article on new&#8208;generation organic scintillators with high exciton utilization efficiency, focusing on molecular design, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance, and X&#8208;ray imaging applications. We also discuss future development trends in organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Porphyrin Derivatives Bearing Six Carboxylic Acids for the Formation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>we synthesized a series of porphyrin derivatives with six carboxylic acid groups to explore their potential in forming hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks (YSHs). By systematically varying the position and structure of these carboxylic acid groups, we observed distinct types of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, including two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional networks. Using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, we confirmed that these derivatives form YSHs with unique structural properties influenced by carboxylic acid positioning and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The 1Zn derivative forms a robust 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded network stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, while the 2Ni derivative, with no such stacking, exhibits reduced stability and collapses upon solvent removal. Structural variations like the terphenylene and biphenyl linkers in 3Zn and 4Zn lead to flexible frameworks, while the 5Zn dimer forms two distinct structures depending on the solvent environment. Our findings reveal that careful control over carboxylic acid orientation and linker structure enables the design of diverse hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks with tunable stability and dimensionality. These insights advance our understanding of supramolecular assembly principles in porphyrin&#8208;based materials and offer new pathways for developing high&#8208;performance frameworks for applications in catalysis, sensing, and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric De Novo Synthesis of Chiral Pyrroles Through Desymmetrizing Oxidative [3+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition and the Van Leusen Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report delineates the first catalytic enantioselective de novo construction of centrally chiral pyrroles through desymmetrizing oxidative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and the first catalytic asymmetric Van Leusen reaction with &#945;&#8211;substituted TosMIC for the synthesis of unsymmetrical pyrroles. A wide range of polycyclic 2&#8208;substituted, 3,4&#8208;fused pyrroles were obtained in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Central chirality in heteroarene derivatives arising from unsymmetrically substituted heteroarene rings is an intriguing but underexplored topic. Herein, we reported the first catalytic enantioselective de novo construction of centrally chiral pyrroles through desymmetrizing oxidative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition by employing silver catalysis. This judicious desymmetrization can produce at least four continuous stereogenic centers without creating any additional stereocenter. Furthermore, to introduce a more diverse set of substituents, we developed the first catalytic asymmetric Van Leusen reaction with &#945;&#8211;substituted TosMIC for the synthesis of centrally chiral pyrroles. A wide range of polycyclic 2&#8208;substituted, 3,4&#8208;fused pyrroles were obtained in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities. This report includes the elaboration of methanobenzo[f]isoindole to synthetically challenging building block chiral isoindole compounds, which are synthesized enantioselectively for the first time.

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Imines with Silylformates: Formation of Silyl Carbamates through CO2 Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reactivity of silylformates, an emerging class of surrogates of hydrosilanes, is revealed in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co&#8208;catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N&#8722;Si bond of an intermediate silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.







Abstract
Silylformates are emerging surrogates of hydrosilanes, able to reduce carbonyl groups in transfer hydrosilylation reactions, with the concomitant release of CO2. In this work, a new reactivity is revealed for silylformates, in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co&#8208;catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N&#8722;Si bond of silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.

The development of lanthanide and transition metal ion crosslinked gels is presented, these made from a tripodal ligand based on the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif, conjugated with terminal terpyridine units through di&#8208;amide spacers. These metallogels were found to be luminescent in the case of Eu(III), Tb(III) and Zn(III), while the ions such as Fe(II) gave rise to strongly coloured material. Being healable, these gels could be cut (as shown) and spliced back together.

         <title>Regulating the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs by pillar[6]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creating molecular&#8208;level host&#8208;guest complexes with properties responsive to endogenous substance stimuli&#8208;responsive as drug delivery systems,&#160;is critical for improving drug stability, reducing side effects, and amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a delivery system for the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (CLB) was developed using the host&#8208;guest interaction with amino&#8208;pillar[6]arene (NP6). NP6 exhibits a high affinity for CLB (Ka = 3.5 &#215; 103 M&#8208;1), resulting in a 1:1 host&#8208;guest complex NP6@CLB. This complex not only effectively prevents premature drug leakage and improves drug stability, but also significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of CLB on L&#8208;02 cells. Notably, NP6 also demonstrated superior complexation (Ka = 3.6 &#215; 103 M&#8208;1) with ATP, an endogenous substance in cells. During NP6@CLB delivery, ATP can compete with CLB to form a host&#8208;guest complex with NP6. This process blocks drug efflux while releasing CLB, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor effects on HeLa cells. This "one stone, two birds" design strategy&#8212;where host&#8208;guest complexes facilitate both direct drug delivery and synergistic enhancement of antitumor properties via ATP binding, opens a new perspective for constructing multifunctional supramolecular chemotherapeutic platforms based on pillar[n]arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Multifunctional AIEgens by Molecular Engineering of Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine For Color Tunable Molecular Salts, Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Applications and Sensing of Mn2+, Ag+, and Fe3+</title>

Color tuneable luminescent molecular salts as promising AIE&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Mechanochromic materials, known for their ability to change color in response to mechanical stimuli such as pressure, stretching, grinding, or rubbing, hold significant importance due to their diverse applications. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel pyridine&#8208;tethered imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine mechanoresponsive luminogens with appended tetraphenylethene, named GBY&#8208;10 and GBY&#8208;11. GBY&#8208;10 exhibited reversible mechanofluorochromism, while GBY&#8208;11 did not revert to its original color after solvent fuming. The photophysical properties of these luminogens were significantly influenced by the position of the terminal pyridine. Additionally, we created color&#8208;tunable mechanoresponsive molecular salts by co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with various aryl acid derivatives. Co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with pentafluorobenzoic acid resulted in a significant bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by 66&#8197;nm, compared to 37&#8197;nm and 12&#8197;nm shift for benzoic acid and para&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, respectively. This counter&#8208;ion&#8208;dependent luminescence suggests strong electronic interactions between the counter ions. These luminogens also demonstrated reversible pH&#8208;responsive behaviour, making them suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. Furthermore, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized luminogen, GBY&#8208;10, showed metal ion detection (Mn2+, Ag+, Fe3+) ability in water, with detection limits as low as 0.0043, 0.015, and 0.0029&#8197;mM, respectively. This report opens new avenues for designing promising AIE&#8208;active materials for potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, optoelectronics, and biomedicine. A de&#8208;novo approach of engineering imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine scaffold to mechanoresponsive AIE&#8208;active molecules for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and metal sensing applications. By co&#8208;grinding the designed luminogens with various aryl acid derivatives, color tuneable mechanoresponsive molecular salts can be further developed.

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled DNA Switching Circuits with Multi&#8208;State Responsiveness for Logic Computation and Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;controlled DNA switching circuit enables switching between three states via triplex switch units to control toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reactions (TMSDRs). It is used for dynamic control of logic computation and hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The circuit can reduce the complexity of DNA circuits, and provide a reliable method for intelligent response and dynamic control of chemical reaction networks (CRNs).







Abstract
Dynamic control of DNA circuit functionality is essential for constructing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement complex functions. The triplex has been utilized for dynamically regulating the diverse functionalities of DNA circuits due to its distinctive pH responsiveness. However, it is challenging for triplexes to independently regulate the functionality of DNA circuits, as various triplexes were often required for DNA circuits to function in complex environments, which adds complexity to the design and control of dynamic circuits. Here, we proposed a pH&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuit construction strategy to realize dynamic regulation among three states through conformational transitions of the triplex. In addition, by leveraging the regulatory role of multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuits on the toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction, we constructed switchable DNA circuits for logic computation and control of hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We confirmed that the designed DNA switching circuits exhibited multi&#8208;state responsiveness, allowing for different logical operations at varying pH levels and programmable control of the diverse reaction pathways in the HCR. Our strategy offers a convenient approach for the intelligent response and dynamic regulation of large&#8208;scale CRNs and DNA nanostructure self&#8208;assembly. It promises applications in biosensing, disease detection and drug delivery.

Lead&#8208;based piezoceramics are the dominant materials used in electronic devices, despite the known toxicity of lead. Developing safer piezoelectric materials has inspired the pursuit of lead&#8208;free piezoceramics, however some challenges remain in accessing these materials reproducibly.

Abstract
Lead&#8208;based piezoceramics are the dominant materials used in electronic devices, despite the known toxicity of lead. Developing safer piezoelectric materials has inspired the pursuit of lead&#8208;free piezoceramics, however some challenges remain in accessing these materials reproducibly. Here we demonstrate a simple and robust method for synthesis of the lead&#8208;free piezoceramic material, potassium sodium niobate (KxNa1&#8208;xNbO3, KNN) via an aqueous route. Stochiometric KNN (K0.5Na0.5NbO3) was prepared, by combining alkali&#8208;nitrate salts (NaNO3 and KNO3) with the hexaniobate ([HxNb6O19]8&#8722;x, Nb6) species in water, followed by heating at elevated temperatures for at least one hour. Ex situ heating of the amorphous alkali&#8208;Nb6 precursor reveals stoichiometric control and phase uniformity are possible in making KNN, versus a solid&#8208;state route. In situ heating in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), facilitates monitoring the real&#8208;time transformation of the amorphous alkali&#8208;Nb6 precursor, to yield monoclinic KNN, in agreement with ex situ results. Therefore, an aqueous route via hexaniobate is an attractive alternative approach for developing lead&#8208;free piezoceramic materials.

Abstract
The selective synthesis of 4&#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiole&#8208;3&#8208;thione in THF and water&#8208;dependent switchable product ketothioamide is demonstrated. The presented method describes explicitly the synthesis of the extremely rare positional isomer 4&#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiole&#8208;3&#8208;thione, a unique structure distinct from another positional isomer, 5&#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithiole&#8208;3&#8208;thione. The unique umpolung of the nitromethyl group is exploited for solvent&#8208;selective nucleophilic sulfur and amine addition. The dual role of the &#8208;CBr3 moiety in the substrate as both a synthetic equivalent and an eliminating group is demonstrated.

         <title>Intramolecular Inhibition by Imidazole in Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Protected Carbohydrates</title>

         <dc:description>
Unexpected inhibition of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene group in 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected D&#8208;gluco&#8208; and D&#8208;allofuranose derivatives is observed. Structural and conformational analyses elucidate critical interactions between the isopropylidene&#8208;protected dioxolane ring and imidazole rings, providing insights into the interplay of carbohydrate O&#8208;protecting groups and steric effects on reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
The present study reveals an unexpected anomaly observed in the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene group in 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected D&#8208;gluco&#8208; and D&#8208;allofuranose derivatives. Although the removal of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene protecting group is typically rapid and quantitative under acidic conditions, an unexpected inhibition of this reaction is observed for the two C3&#8208;epimers, 3&#8208;O&#8208;imidazole sulfonyl moiety. X&#8208;ray data show a two&#8208;faced imidazole ring orientation in the crystal, while solution state NOE data reveal a critical interaction type between the isopropylidene and the imidazole rings. Advanced conformational searches coupled with ab initio molecular modeling illuminate and explain the NMR and kinetic data and lay the groundwork for the most plausible mechanism of this unprecedented inhibition. These results provide valuable insights into the cross&#8208;coupling of carbohydrate O&#8208;protecting groups and shed light on how specific ring orientations and steric effects can trigger the inhibition of an otherwise easily feasible reaction, such as an acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis.

         <title>Regioselective Dimerization of Methylcyclopentadiene inside Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbit[7]uril serves as a supramolecular catalyst for the cycloaddition reaction of methylcyclopentadiene, affording a 104&#8208;fold rate enhancement and a significant change in the regioselectivity. This reaction predominantly yields a single product that is both kinetically and thermodynamically disfavored and typically observed only as a minor component in the dimerization of neat methylcyclopentadiene or in commercial dimeric mixtures.







Abstract
The molecular confinement within rigid macrocyclic receptors can trigger catalytic activity and steer the selectivity of organic reactions. In this work, the dimerization of methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) isomers in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was found to display, besides a large rate acceleration, a striking regioselectivity in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;3, different from the products predominating in the absence of the supramolecular catalyst. Among the different possible regioisomers and diastereomers, the endo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3a,4,7,7a&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoindene adduct was selectively formed, which is otherwise found only as a minor product in the dimerization of neat MCPD or in commercial dimeric mixtures. This product originates from the reaction of the heteroternary complex of 1&#8208;MCPD and 2&#8208;MCPD within CB7, in which the methyl groups are positioned in an &#8220;anti&#8208;diaxial&#8221; arrangement and point towards the open portals of the macrocycle, resulting in a preferred packing of the reacting cyclopentadiene rings. The selectivity of the dimerization of MCPD in the absence and presence of CB7 is supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Translocation&#8208;Coupled Ligand&#8208;Binding/Release by Dinuclear Rhodium Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe that the dinuclear translocation switch behavior is coupled to the ligand&#8208;binding/release of organometallic complexes. The two rhodium moieties sandwiched between arylpolyene ligands exhibit metal&#8208;assembly and disassembly through reversible migration between the arene site and the olefin site, according to the association and dissociation of additional ligands.







Abstract
Switching the location of metal atoms or ions in a molecule has been of great interest as a behavior of molecular machines. We describe herein that the reversible metal translocation can be coupled with the ligand&#8208;binding/release of organometallic complexes. The two rhodium moieties sandwiched between arylpolyene ligands exhibit metal&#8208;assembly and disassembly through reversible migration between the arene site and the olefin site, in response to the association and dissociation of additional ligands. This occurs either with bridging or even non&#8208;bridging ligands, where the latter involves oxidative &#960;&#8208;addition of the unsaturated hydrocarbon binder to the metal moieties. The assembling&#8208; and disassembling states were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Switching Photoluminescence Wavelength of Arylated Single&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes by Utilizing Steric Hindrance in Reductive Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of substituent in the aryl groups at an appropriate position is effective to control near infrared photoluminescence efficiency and wavelength of arylated single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. Theoretical calculations of the corresponding model compounds revealed that these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.







Abstract
(6,5)&#8208;enriched single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were reductively arylated using sodium naphthalenide and monosubstituted and disubstituted iodobenzene derivatives to control their photoluminescence (PL) properties. In the reactions with substituted iodobenzenes, the degree of functionalization was influenced by the substituents on the aryl groups depending on their position, which allowed us to realize control of the PL intensity and wavelength. The methyl or methoxy group at the 2&#8208;position and methyl groups at the 3,5&#8208;positions of the phenyl group respectively increased the E11** PL and E11* PL selectivity at ~1230 and ~1100&#8197;nm. Methyl groups at the 2,6&#8208;positions emerged two new PL peaks. These PL characteristics were prominently observed in the (6,4) SWCNT adducts, which were separated by gel chromatography. Theoretical calculations of model compounds showed that the effect of the substituent at the ortho&#8208;position on the relative stability of the isomers with different binding configurations was greater for the diarylated SWCNTs than for the hydroarylated SWCNTs. Experimental and theoretical calculation results revealed that the choice of substituents on the benzene ring was effectively used to modulate the PL wavelength, and these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is crucial in industry, but traditional synthesis methods have environmental and safety issues. The 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a safe, eco&#8208;friendly approach. This review highlights noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials for 2e&#8722; ORR, including transition metal compounds, macrocyclic complexes, carbon&#8208;based catalysts, framework materials, and MXenes catalysts, which improve H2O2 production efficiency and sustainability.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a versatile chemical widely used in various industries. The traditional anthraquinone method for H2O2 synthesis has environmental and safety concerns due to the use of organic solvents and hazardous by&#8208;products. The direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 poses risks of flammability and explosion. Recently, the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) method has emerged as a promising alternative, offering safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. This method utilizes gas diffusion electrodes to efficiently generate H2O2 without the need for additional dilution. In this review, we focus on the recent advancements in noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials for 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis, which play a crucial role in the efficient production of H2O2. These materials, including transition metal compounds, macrocyclic complexes, carbon&#8208;based catalysts, framework materials, and MXenes catalysts, demonstrate significant advantages in enhancing H2O2 yield. The development of these non&#8208;precious metal catalysts can reduce costs and improve sustainability and promote the commercialization of related technologies. The review concludes with an outlook on the future trends of 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have widespread applications in synthesis as organocatalysts or ligands for organometallic complexes. This Mini&#8208;review article focuses on an important but often neglected area of their chemistry, where NHCs and their N&#8208;heterocyclic precursors or derivatives have been used as stoichiometric reagents or building blocks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become important tools in modern synthetic chemistry due to their versatility as organocatalysts and ligands in organometallic complexes. Since their first isolation and characterization, NHCs have demonstrated significant utility in various catalytic processes, offering advantages such as strong &#963;&#8208;electron donation and the ability to stabilize reactive intermediates. However, beyond their well&#8208;documented roles in catalysis, the potential of NHCs as stoichiometric reagents and synthetic building blocks remains an underexplored yet promising area. This Mini&#8208;review aims to shed light on these lesser&#8208;known applications of NHCs and their N&#8208;heterocyclic precursors or derivatives in organic synthesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the unique electronic and steric properties of NHCs can be harnessed to develop new synthetic methodologies or construct interesting organic frameworks. By highlighting these emerging uses, we hope to encourage further research into the non&#8208;catalytic applications of NHCs, broadening their scope and impact in synthetic chemistry.

This study presents the design and application of two Fe(II)&#8208;based hybrid catalysts, [SiO&#8322;@benzNP&#8208;FeII] and [SiO&#8322;@benzNHP&#8208;FeII], for efficient hydrogen (H&#8322;) production via formic acid (HCOOH) and formaldehyde (HCHO) dehydrogenation. The reduction of Schiff base ligands to incorporate N&#8722;H groups significantly enhances efficiency, stability, and reusability.

Abstract
The use of hybrids, developed by grafting homogeneous catalysts onto supporting materials, has already demonstrated significant potential in various catalytic processes. These systems combine the advantages of homogeneous catalysts, such as high activity and selectivity, with those of solid supports, including enhanced recyclability. Catalytic hydrogen (H2) production via dehydrogenation of C1 organic molecules targeting its use in fuel cells is a contemporary scientific issue directly connected with climate crisis. Here, Iminophospine hybrid [SiO2@benzNP] and its reduced analogue [SiO2@benzNHP] were synthesized, covalently grafted on colloidal SiO2, fully characterized (FT&#8208;IR, RAMAN, TGA, ssNMR, BET), and used for in&#8208;situ synthesis of [SiO2@benzNP&#8208;FeII] and [SiO2@benzNHP&#8208;FeII] catalytic complexes for H2 production from formic acid (HCOOH) and formaldehyde (HCHO), at 80&#8201;&#176;C. In HCOOH, both heterogenized catalysts exhibit high selectivity, producing H2 and CO2 in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio, without CO contamination, making them ideal for fuel cell applications. [SiO&#8322;@benzNHP&#8208;FeII] catalyst demonstrated superior performance in both substates. In HCOOH dehydrogenation, over 82,000 turnover number (TONs) were achieved and retained its efficiency for over five cycles, without any further metal addition. In HCHO dehydrogenation, it showed excellent efficiency as well, achieving 1.3&#8197;L of pure H2 with TONs exceeding 7,000, in 3 consecutive uses. Advanced spectroscopic analysis confirmed the stability and structural integrity of the catalysts, linking the Schiff base reduction and N&#8722;H groups to enhanced activity, durability and reusability. This study demonstrates the potential of hybrid materials with non&#8208;noble metals for cost&#8208;effective and sustainable H2 production, paving the way for scalable renewable energy solutions.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Fe3O4/N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Nanospheres for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the isolation and pore&#8208;forming effects of Zn2+ to synthesize a composite of ultra&#8208;small Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored on hierarchically N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanospheres (CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1). The efficient synergistic effect, among Fe3O4 nanoparticles, porous carbon nanospheres, and N&#8208;doping, synergistically improves the ORR electrocatalytic performance of the CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 catalyst in an alkaline medium.







Abstract
Designing transition metal oxide (TMO)/porous carbon composite materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a promising strategy in high&#8208;performance fuel cell technology. In this study, we used the isolation effect and pore&#8208;creating properties of Zn2+ to fabricate a composite material comprising ultrasmall Fe3O4 particles anchored on hierarchically N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanospheres. This material, referred to as CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1, serves as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline fuel cells. CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibits outstanding ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V in a 0.1&#8197;M KOH solution, surpassing that of the Pt/C catalyst (0.82&#8197;V). Furthermore, CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibited excellent stability with minimal current degradation after 18&#8197;h of continuous testing. The superior ORR catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the catalytic sites and the high conductivity of porous carbon. The porous carbon nanospheres effectively address the low conductivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, while the ultra&#8208;small Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored on the carbon surface provide efficient catalytic sites for the ORR.

         <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Activity of &#960;&#8208;Expanded Electron&#8208;Rich Heterohelicenes Based on the 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>

Only three steps are required to construct complex blue/green&#8208;emitting heterohelicenes encompassing 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core. 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization accompanied by HBr elimination is a key step and the course of 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization can be predicted using analysis of the LUMO orbital symmetry. The heterohelicenes possess fluorescence quantum yields up to 32&#8201;% and circularly polarized luminescence brightness reaching 30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in non&#8208;polar solvents.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and chiroptical characteristics of the first (double) helicenes possessing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (DHPP) moiety as their central core. We have developed a three&#8208;step synthesis with 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied by HBr elimination as its key step. We found that, whereas for smaller peripheral arms double 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization occurs smoothly forming a double helicene, in the case of longer polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the reaction becomes less efficient and mono&#8208;helicenes are the only products. The electron density distribution analysis of LUMO explains the different regioselectivity of 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. The synthesized heterohelicenes are characterized by greenish&#8208;blue emission, distinct solvatofluorochromism and good fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42&#8201;%). Moreover, the chiroptical measurements reveal that unsymmetrical double heterohelicene exhibits excellent circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reaching 30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. The combined experimental and computational study has revealed that a charge&#8208;transfer state is responsible for the observed emission (hence the solvatochromism), while low&#8208;energy absorption derives from multiple transitions.

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;assembly of Nanographdiynes Mediated by Molecular Dipoles Induced by Rotatory Asymmetric Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotatory bulky asymmetry substituents were introduced at the edge of nanographdiynes to induce molecular dipole. And directional dipole&#8208;dipole interactions guided these nanographdiynes, which were substituted by groups with different push&#8208;pull electronic properties, to self&#8208;assemble into different &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked H&#8208;dimers. These dimers exhibited different conformations, different abilities to further aggregation, and ultimately had different optical properties.







Abstract
The discrete &#960;&#8208; stacks of specific lengths and orientation is crucial for understanding the impact of intermolecular interactions on optical or electronic properties of nanographdiynes. We designed and synthesized nanographdiynes modified with bulky rotatable asymmetric substituents. The peripheral substituents with different push&#8208;pull electronic properties can induce molecular dipoles perpendicular to nanoGDY &#960; surface with different orientation. Mediated by directional dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, o&#8208;TBGDY substituted with electron&#8208;donating tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups cofacially dimerized with a twist angle, involving intermolecular interlocking of ortho&#8208;substituted tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups. In contrast, OTFGDY substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluorophenyl groups formed dimeric H&#8208;aggregates with an in&#8208;plane shift along one diyne linkage, in which the ortho&#8208;substituted trifluorophenyl groups point toward the outside of the interacting &#960;&#8208;plane. o&#8208;TBGDY can only exist as isolated H&#8208;dimer in the solid state, while OTFGDY can form a hybrid tetramer of H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates. Our researches reveal a new method for preparing discrete &#960;&#8208;stacked dye assemblies with well&#8208;defined optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Design of Rigid Compounds to Enhance Selectivity for Carbonic Anhydrase IX</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High affinity and selectivity for intended targets is an important goal of small molecule design in drug discovery, yet balancing molecular flexibility and rigidity remains a challenge. While flexible compounds can increase target affinity, they often result in non&#8208;specific interactions and reduced selectivity. In contrast, rigid compounds may recognize their target more precisely and have lower off&#8208;target effects. In this study, we incorporated a 1,1&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine ring into fluorinated benzenesulfonamide derivatives with bulky meta&#8208;substituents to enhance selectivity for human carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an important cancer&#8208;associated target. Due to the structural similarities of CAIX with other carbonic anhydrase isozymes, selective inhibition remains a significant challenge. A series of 3,4&#8208;substituted trifluorobenzenesulfonamides containing oxidized thiazine rings were synthesized using a novel synthetic pathway. Although the potency against CAIX was modestly reduced compared to more flexible analogs, selectivity increased significantly, with lead compounds 7d and 7e exhibiting over 1000&#8208;fold selectivity for CAIX over most other isozymes. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the structural basis for this selectivity, confirming the advantageous positioning of rigidified compounds within some CA isozyme active sites. These findings highlight the potential of molecular rigidity in the design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Sensing with a Pyridine&#8208;Based Lanthanide Contrast Agent: Structural Analysis in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original paramagnetic probe was developed, whose Magnetic Resonance Imaging efficacy is modified upon Zn2+ complexation. A combination of NMR, DFT and luminescence studies shows that these changes are due to a modification of the Gd3+ coordination sphere. The complex exhibits high selectivity for Zn2+ over other physiological cations.







Abstract
Zinc is an important physiological cation, and its misregulation is implicated in various diseases. It is therefore important to be able to image zinc by non&#8208;invasive methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel Gd3+&#8208;based complex specifically for Zn2+ sensing by MRI. Using a combination of NMR, luminescence, potentiometric, and relaxivity experiments, completed with DFT calculations, we demonstrate that incorporating a short linker between the Zn2+ sensing unit and the Gd3+ complex leads to unique behavior of the system in the absence of Zn2+. A significant increase in efficacy of the system is observed upon Zn2+ binding, and importantly, the complex is highly selective for Zn2+ relative to other physiological cations. A comprehensive structural study reliably determines the microscopic parameters at the origin of the Zn2+ response, primarily an increase in the number of water molecules directly coordinated to Gd3+ upon Zn2+ binding. Crucially, the system maintains a strong response to Zn2+ binding in the presence of Human Serum Albumin, highlighting its potential for biological applications.

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Materials Based on Dynamic Chemical Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically adaptive polymers (MAPs) can regulate mechanical properties in response to external stimuli or environmental changes. Utilizing dynamic chemical bonds to construct polymer networks presents an effective and preferential strategy in designing MAPs for various practical applications. This review primarily focuses on the recent advancements in the fabrication, mechanisms, and functions of MAPs based on dynamic bonds.







Abstract
Adaptiveness is an important feature for biological creatures to survive and interact with variable environments. Mechanically adaptive polymers (MAPs), which have been developed recently inspired by this adaptive nature, can regulate their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli or environmental changes. Specifically, MAPs based on dynamic chemical bonds have been synthesized and reported as an emerging material because of the intrinsic self&#8208;adaptability, outstanding mechanical properties and durable applications. This review primarily focuses on the recent advancements in the fabrication of MAPs through the utilization of dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent bonds. A comprehensive summary of the methodologies and mechanisms employed to attain high energy dissipation in MAPs is provided. Subsequently, the review offers incisive analyses of the intrinsic functionalities of MAPs, such as high impact&#8208;stiffening, damping, and buffering capabilities. Finally, the developmental achievements within this domain are recapitulated, the potential challenges, and future research perspectives in MAPs are deliberated.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones as Masked Vinyl Ketone Equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones via addition of a vinyl Grignard reagent into amides followed by trapping of the vinyl ketone intermediate with the magnesium&#8208;amide by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully translated from a batch process into continuous flow mode to increase its efficiency, safety and scalability. Different set&#8208;ups were evaluated to minimize/overcome clogging issues arising from magnesium salt precipitates. Ultimately, the resulting &#946;&#8208;aminoketones were obtained in high yields and productivities with residence times of less than 90 seconds at elevated temperatures of 50 &#176;C. Importantly, the &#946;&#8208;aminoketone products are valuable building blocks that can be unmasked to reactive vinyl ketones via a Cope elimination process.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalytic Direct N&#8208;(Het)arylation of Lactams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactam rings are essential structural motifs in organic chemistry, widely present in natural products and clinically important drugs, such as antibiotics and antiepileptics. Existing methods for synthesizing N&#8208;functionalized lactams often require harsh conditions, toxic reagents, or complex catalytic systems. Here, we report a mild and efficient photochemical approach for generating N&#8208;centered radicals, enabling straightforward N&#8208;heteroarylation of lactams. This versatile method enables the synthesis of a range of N&#8208;(het)arylated lactams and is effective even in aqueous media, facilitating the functionalization of biomolecules. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction is easily scalable under continuous flow conditions, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;like Crystals from [4+4] Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, porous organic cages have gained in importance, inter alia, due to their ability to be processed from solution. Especially the packing of the cages in the solid state structure has a significant effect on the porosity. Therefore, it is important to be able control the packing pattern either by crystallization conditions or the interaction of molecular units, defined as crystal engineering synthons. Here, tribromoarene subunits as such are incorporated into cage structures, namely a [2+3] and a [4+4] imine cages, to study the reliability of thus subunit as crystal engineering synthon. Several solvatomorphs of both cages were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and packing patterns thoroughly analyzed. Among those solvatomorphs an interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;type supramolecular arrangement is found.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4&#8211;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4&#8211;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross&#8211;coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late&#8208;stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues. The use of thorough mechanistic investigations revealed the aggregation state of the newly formed tetrahydroquinoline anion to be a separated ion pair, which proved critical to optimizing the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Halogen Substitution on the Regioselective Deiodination of Thyroid Hormone Analogues by Deiodinase Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) by the three isoforms of selenium&#8208;containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) is an important process in the human body for the maintenance of the thyroid hormone homeostasis. Selenium compounds are known to mimic the function of DIO3 by catalyzing the 5&#8208;deiodination of T4 and a co&#8208;operative halogen and chalcogen bonding is responsible for their activity. The substitution of 4'&#8208;OH group of T4 by an electron withdrawing group not only alters the reactivity but also changes the regioselectivity of deiodination. However, the effect of other halogen atoms (F, Cl or Br) in place of iodine in T4 on the regioselectivity has not been explored. In this paper, we describe simple synthetic methodologies toward various halogen analogues of T4. We also show that 2D NMR spectroscopy can be used as a powerful tool to identify the location of various halogen substitutions on the phenolic or tyrosyl rings. The deiodination experiments with peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene diselenol reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of a Terminal Hydride through Regioselective Protonation in a Diiron Complex Inspired by [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protonation studies of the complex [Fe2(&#181;&#8208;pdt)(&#954;2&#8208;dmpe)2(CO)2] (1), inspired by the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases active site cofactor, yield terminal and bridging hydrido isomers in a ratio that depends on the acid strength and steric hindrance. A terminal hydride ligand is mainly obtained in presence of weaker acids such as [HPtBu3][BF4] and [HNEt3][BF4] while a bridging isomer is predominantly formed with stronger acids such as [HPPh3][BF4] and [H(OEt2)][BF4]. The terminal isomer is comparatively stable and undergoes isomerization into the bridging hydride following first&#8208;order kinetics, with half&#8208;lives of 21 days and 3 days at room temperature and 40&#176;C, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Exchange in Thioguanosine Coordination Polymers of Gold (I) and Silver (I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic coordination polymers of Au(I) and Ag(I) with 6&#8208;thioguanosine, poly([AuxAg1&#8208;x(6&#8722;tG)]), have been prepared and were observed to form hydrogels. We find that the composition of the heterometallic polymer is proportional to&#160;the mole fractions of the metals in the preparation solution. Optical absorption spectra show single peaks for &#955; &gt; 300 nm which can be interpolated in a linear manner between x = 0.0 and x = 1.0 consistent with the formation of a heterometallic polymer rather than a mixture of homopolymers. However photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra are sensitive to the supramolecular structure of the polymers and show more complex behaviour. Atomic force microscopy indicated that the molecular chains of the Au homopolymer entwine to form strands that are predominantly right&#8208;hand helices. The&#160;Ag homopolymer&#160;has previously been shown to form left&#8208;hand helices. Intermediate compositions have more complex structures because of the competition between the left and right&#8208;handed preferences of the homopolymers. Finally, we have shown that the metal&#8208;ligand bonds are labile on a timescale of about 5 h at ambient temperature (about 293 K). Mixtures of homopolymers transform to the corresponding heterometallic coordination polymer by metal exchange as judged by optical absorption, photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;stable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic framework (HOF) for Selective Sensing of Antibiotics in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively used as fluorescent&#8208;based antibiotic sensors, newly developed hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are largely unexplored toward this direction. To realize this, the luminescent HOFs must be stable in water as the analytes are mostly found in water&#8208;based effluents in environments. In addition, HOFs should be equipped with specific recognition sites in order to direct the discrimination among the antibiotics. Herein, we report a 3D porous HOF, IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6, constructed from an aromatic&#8208;rich tetratopic carboxylic acid (H4L), which exhibits excellent hydro and prolonged open&#8208;air stability (7 and 15 days, respectively). IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 was explored for the highly selective detection of nitrofurans (NFs) family of antibiotics in aqueous medium exhibiting a remarkably low detection limit of 0.75 &#181;M for nitrofurazone (NFZ) through luminescence quenching. Photoinduced electron transfer driven by the presence of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited state below to the [[EQUATION]] and Forster energy transfer between H4L donor and NFZ acceptor are confirmed to be responsible for observed quenching using detailed quantum&#8208;chemical studies. This work demonstrates the usage of HOFs as sensory materials toward antibiotics in aqueous medium along with a clear understanding into the sensing mechanism at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Alexidine and Pentamidine Fold Inside the Bowl&#8208;Shaped Cavity of p&#8208;Sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the U&#8208;shaped folding of flexible guest molecules of medicinal interest upon their inclusion into macrocyclic cavity of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene in aqueous media. Alexidine and pentamidine are FDA&#8208;approved drug compounds currently rediscovered as potent membrane&#8208;targeting antibiotic adjuvants helping restore antibiotic activity against multidrug resistant bacteria pathogens. We have adopted host&#8208;guest and crystal engineering approach to study these drugs with a view of potential supramolecular formulations and/or crystal forms. We focus on the host&#8208;guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, self&#8208;assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl&#8208;shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM&#8208;MS structural studies of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host&#8208;guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Metal Species as A Promoter to Enhance Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a focal point of research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. This paper reviews the progress in the studies of single atoms as promoters in various catalytic reactions, elucidating their distinctive role in comparison to the dominant active sites. We provide a discussion on the application of single&#8208;atom promoters (SAP) within host&#8208;guest systems in various catalysts, including metal oxide supported catalysts, molybdenum carbide&#8208;based catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, and others. The behavior of SAP is diverse. They often promote the formation of oxygen vacancies for oxide support, leading to local site reconstruction that creates specific reaction route. Moreover, they can also precisely modify the electronic structure of hetero&#8208;metal atomic or nanoparticle sites, then regulating the adsorption of reactants or intermediates and catalytic performance. Finally, the potential for the development of SAP is outlined, proposing novel approach for the design of SACs with enhanced activity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission in Chalcone&#8208;based Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor System and The Modulation of Down&#8208;Conversion of Triplet Exciton with the Polarity of the Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has recently emerged as a promising process with significant potential to advance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) for display applications. The donor&#8208;acceptor system is a well&#8208;known molecular arrangement exhibiting TADF properties. However, our investigation into the chalcone&#8208;based donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) system (SKG1) reveals that the en&#8208;one bridging unit in chalcone plays a crucial role in the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process and may be responsible for the existence of two conformational isomers. In stark contrast with the conventional endothermic TADF process, the designed molecule follows a down&#8208;converted cold rISC pathway that also from a higher&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) state to the lowest singlet (S1) state (in toluene) with remarkably short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 350 ns. Additionally, this rISC process is found to be sensitive to the polarity of the medium. The UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) process within &lt;100ps and the involvement of higher lying triplet state in rISC process. This comprehensive research deepens the understanding of the rISC mechanism and paves the way for developing next&#8208;generation OLED materials using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;based delayed emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Blue Electroluminescence Based on A Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor with Pyrene Bridge: Weak Charge&#8208;transfer (CT) For High Luminescence and Considerable Exciton Utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blue emitters are crucial in the organic light emitting diode (OLED) industry and scientific field. In this work, we prepared a novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecular PCZ&#8208;P&#8208;PY using pyrene as a bridge to construct hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state with weak charge&#8208;transfer (CT) property. This excited state design give rise to the high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY), more importantly, it is also responsible for the high exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) by constructing efficient hot&#8208;exciton channel. As a result, exceeding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.7% is achieved in the non&#8208;doped OLED of PCZ&#8208;P&#8208;PY with exceeding EUE of up to 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective On&#8208;Surface Metalation and Uncommon Reordering of Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Biquinazoline Ligands on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The macrocyclic biquinazoline ligand, H&#8208;Mabiq, presents a central and a peripheral site for the coordination of metal ions, making the adsorption on solid surfaces promising for the creation of self&#8208;assembled bimetallic two&#8208;dimensional platforms. Here, we apply an on&#8208;surface metalation strategy under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions to guide the synthesis of metalated species and study sequential metalation patterns. We find that cobalt (as well as iron) metalation on the Ag(111) surface preferentially occurs at the macrocyclic centre without further metal coordination to the peripheral site. Nevertheless, starting from a densely packed, self&#8208;assembled H&#8208;Mabiq monolayer, the modification of the central cavity by Co is accompanied by an unusual, metalation&#8208;induced phase transformation which gives evidence of modified lateral / interfacial interactions. The selective metalation of one molecular site opens up an on&#8208;surface route to create bimetallic networks incorporating select metal ions at different locations.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Surfactants via Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. The process utilizes ubiquitous amino acids and common alcohols without protecting group manipulations. Surfactants are synthesized in a single step using a commercially available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst in a waste&#8208;free manner with nearly ideal atom economy. The versatility of the products is shown by further derivatization resulting in novel Gemini surfactants and a related quaternary ammonia salt. The analysis of selected compounds shows remarkable properties as surfactants. Further studies show their potential biodegradability in nature, which enhances the broad application profile of the sustainable products prepared in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene&#8211;Fluorescein Hybrids: A Reversible Base&#8208;triggered (Chir)optical Switch with Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;luminescence (CPL) materials were designed and synthesized by integrating the intrinsic chirality of helicene with the acid/base&#8208;responsive properties of fluorescein. The synthesized helicene&#8211;fluorescein hybrids exhibit reversible switching between blue fluorescence under neutral conditions and red fluorescence under basic conditions. Furthermore, these hybrid compounds demonstrate unique chiroptical switching behavior with a rare base&#8208;triggered CPL sign inversion, where (P)&#8208;isomers show a negative CPL signal around 450 nm under neutral conditions and a positive signal around 620 nm under basic conditions, with three&#8208;fold enhanced dissymmetry factors (|glum|) under basic conditions. The structural basis for this switching was elucidated through TD&#8208;DFT calculations, revealing distinct angles between magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in closed versus open forms. Live&#8208;cell imaging experiments using HeLa cells revealed that the hybrid compounds exhibit intracellular red emission with minimal cytotoxicity, thus promising potential as chiral fluorescent probes for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of (L)MX (L = isocyanide; M = Cu(I) or Au(I); X = chloride or carboranyl) complexes have been prepared. The first examples of isocyanide Cu(I) chloride complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry between isocyanide and CuCl are reported and structurally characterised. The photophysical properties of (RNC)AuCl and (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) complexes have been investigated. Complexes (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) show no aurophilic Au&#8208;Au interactions and emit long&#8208;lived deep&#8208;blue phosphorescence up to 377 &#956;s. The radioluminescence of these gold complexes was studied to show a superior radioluminescence stability for the gold(carboranyl) complexes compared to gold chloride materials&#160;under constant high energy X&#8208;ray radiation of 350 keV.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorination of tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium ((DMP)3C+) was achieved through the partial defluorination of the methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Using the fluorinated 2F((DMP)3C+) as a precursor, fluorinated tetramethoxy&#8208; and dimethoxyquin&#8208; acridinium salts (2F4 and 2F5 respectively) and trioxo&#8208;, azadioxo&#8208;, and diazaoxo&#8208; triangulenium salts (2F6, 2F7 and 2F8 respectively) were synthesized successfully in good to moderate yields. Fluorination induced significant red shifts in absorption (16 to 29 nm) and emission (13 to 41 nm) maxima, and increased electrophilicity as evidenced by lower reduction potentials.

         <dc:description>The combination of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies and polymer science has resulted in the development of soft materials with diverse properties and applications. In particular, the coordination cages of predefined shape, size, and internal cavity can be utilized intelligently as promising building units for designing responsive and smart soft materials with dual porosity, contributing to the introduction of versatile host&#8208;guest chemistry into gels. In this review, we present the recent advancements in gels incorporating coordination cages into their networks, ranging from synthesis strategies to state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications. In particular, the host&#8208;guest chemistry endows the hybrid gel materials with possibilities for guest&#8208;specific responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Precise Self&#8208;assembly of Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) to form nanostructures of various morphologies and controllable dimensions has been a very promising research area in nanotechnology in recent decades. This review mainly summarizes the recent advances in precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of BCPs through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy to modulate the self&#8208;assembly behavior of the BCPs. These efforts have led to a better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and opened new possibilities for creating novel materials with designable properties. We hope that the review is more than a periodical summary of previous research work and can provide valuable inspiration for the research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule Magnet Properties of Silole&#8208; and Stannole&#8208;ligated Erbium Cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, structures and magnetic properties of an &#951;5&#8208;silole complex and an &#951;5&#8208;stannole complex of erbium are reported. The sandwich complex anions [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSi)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; and [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211;, where CpSi is [SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2]2&#8211; (1Si), CpSn is [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8211; (1Sn) and COT = cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl, were obtained as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salts and found to be isostructural, with remarkably similar bond lengths and angles, differing only in the lengths of the Er&#8211;E interactions (E = Si, Sn). The parallels in the molecular structures of 1Si and 1Sn are reflected in their dynamic magnetic properties, which show single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in zero applied field, with effective energy barriers of 115 &#177; 7 and 125 &#177; 3 cm&#8211;1, respectively, along with comparable magnetic relaxation times. Analysis of the two complexes using ab initio calculations reveals differences at a quantitative level, but overall similar electronic structures, with the thermally activated relaxation likely to proceed via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet. Comparing 1Si and 1Sn with the previously reported germanium analogue 1Ge reveals that swapping one heavier group 14 element for another in complexes of the type [(&#951;5&#8208;CpE)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; has a minimal impact on the SMM behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;healing behavior of metallopolymers in complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This current study focusses on the investigation of the self&#8208;healing abilities of metallopolymers containing different kinds of metal complexes, which were processed by direct digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. For this purpose, 2&#8209;phenoxyethyl acrylate is mixed with ligand&#8208;containing monomers either based on triphenylmethyl(trt)&#8208;histidine or terpyridine, respectively. Either zinc(II) or nickel(II) salts are successfully applied for a complexation of the ligand monomers in solution and, subsequently, photopolymerization is performed. The thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of the obtained metallopolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as&#160;dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Multiple damages with defined forces ranging from 20 to 1500 mN were introduced into the 3D&#8208;structures and successfully healed within 24&#160;h at 70&#160;&#176;C or 120&#160;&#176;C, respectively without losing the structural integrity of the overall 3D&#8208;structures. Herein, excellent healing efficiencies up to 97% were determined. Consequently, these hollow structures not only feature very good self&#8208;healing abilities but also excellent retention of the 3D&#8208;structure at and above the healing temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Phosphepines: Synthesis by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Ring Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides provided versatile benzo&#8208;fused phosphepine oxides. O&#8208;exo adducts were obtained as the major product, and O&#8208;endo adducts were the minor product. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo indicate the position of an oxygen atom with respect to the central phosphepine framework. The isomers of dibenzo[b,d]phosphepine oxides with methyl and phenyl groups in an adjacent position (shown as 2a and 3a in the main text) were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo adducts are diastereomers owing to the central chirality of the phosphorus atom and the planar chirality of phosphepine, and they are interconverted through a ring inversion of phosphepine via a transition state with a planar structure. The inversion barrier, fully estimated through theoretical calculations, drastically&#160;varied depending on the substituents in the phosphepine framework and/or the fusion of benzene and thiophene rings. Furthermore, the kinetics of the thermal isomerization of less stable O&#8208;endo product 3a into O&#8208;exo product 2a was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic&#8208;Polypeptide Block Copolymers: Synthesis and Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly in Aqueous Solutions to Rod&#8208;like and Plate&#8208;like Micelles with Polypeptide Coronas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of polyferrocenyldimethylsilane&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block copolymers was systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles were prepared from self&#8208;assembly of the block copolymers in aqueous solution with two different approaches. In a dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, micelles were prepared by dissolving a block copolymer sample in excess aqueous base followed by the dialysis of the solution against water. The morphology of the resultant micelles showed composition dependence. The block copolymer sample with the lowest soluble block content formed rod&#8208;like micelles, while the other samples with higher soluble block content formed spherical micelles. In a THF&#8208;mediated approach, THF was added into a block copolymer solution, which was first prepared by the dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, and then the THF was evaporated slowly. Plate&#8208;like micelles were obtained from all the block copolymer samples examined, and these had a broad range of soluble block content. The formation of these plate&#8208;like micelles was attributed to the crystallization of the PFDMS blocks in the presence of THF. A tendency of large platelet micelles evolving to thin filaments over time was observed. This change may have been driven by the increase in the corona&#8208;chain stretching energy as THF evaporated.</dc:description>

         <title>DECIPHERING AND COUNTERING FORMIC ACID PERMEABILITY IN ZERO&#8208;GAP ELECTROLYZERS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, formic acid (FA) has garnered attention as a compelling molecule for various chemical and everyday applications Additionally, with recent studies demonstrating direct FA generation through CO2&#160;electrolysis, it can serve as a stable liquid hydrogen carrier. Nevertheless, FA&#8208;permeability via semi&#8208;permeable ion&#8209;exchange membranes (FA&#8208;crossover) still constitutes a major issue in scalable polymer&#8208;electrolyte separated zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, limiting the breakthrough of the technology to the larger&#8208;scale. Herein we present a holistic route towards understanding the mechanism of FA&#8208;crossover in zero&#8208;gap cells. The gained know&#8208;how through formic acid uptake, gel&#8208;phase conductivity, and membrane permeability measurements allowed for the development of an easy&#8208;to&#8208;scale barrier layer, showing a FA&#8208;flux (JFA) decrease by 46&#160;% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8209;2&#160;compared to bare Nafion&#8208;membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Functionalized Bulky&#8208;Cyclopentadiene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of significantly bulky mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC)&#8208; functionalized cyclopentadiene ring (Cp) compounds were synthesized. The functionalization of the Cp ring with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties. In these compounds, intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer is observed from electron&#8208;rich carbene to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit. These high yielding compounds have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction and their emission properties have been studied. Rotational conformers (via C&#8722;C bond rotation) play a pivotal role with possible different extent of intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) from carbene to cyclopentadiene ring. Variable temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies were performed along with NOSY, COSY and different 2D NMR techniques to estimate the energy barriers and 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the voltage&#8208;Gated Potassium channels by Amphiphilic Glycopeptides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels (VGICs) are allosterically modulated by glycosaminoglycan proteoglycans and sialic acid glycans. However, the structural diversity and heterogeneity of these biomolecules pose significant challenges to precisely delineate their underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, we demonstrate how heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid synthetic glycans appended on amphiphilic glycopeptide backbone influence cell membrane persistence and modulate the gating of the Kv2.1 channel. &#160;Utilizing a panel of amphiphilic glycopeptides comprising HS disaccharides and sialic acid trisaccharide glycans, we observed that sulfation of HS and flexible &#945;(2&#8208;6) sialylation result in prolonged persistence of glycopeptides on the cell membrane compared to non&#8208;sulfated HS and &#945;(2&#8208;3) sialylation respective. This variation in glycocalyx composition was associated with a noticeable difference in the effects of these compounds on the activation and inactivation properties of the voltage&#8208;gated Kv2.1 channel with our strongest membrane associating compound demonstrating the most potent channel&#8208;activation propensity. Our findings demonstrate that sulfation charges on glycopeptide play a critical role in their membrane association propensities and endow them with VGIC activation properties. and provide a valuable insight into the role of cell surface glycans in VGIC activities.</dc:description>
