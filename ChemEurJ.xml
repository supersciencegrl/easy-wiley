      <title>Late&#8208;stage C(sp2)&#8208;H Functionalization: A Powerful Toolkit to Arm Natural Products for In Situ Proteome Profiling?</title>
      <dc:description>Comprehensive investigation of target interactions from native cellular environments is of paramount importance for natural products and related bioactive compounds in drug discovery and chemical biology. Current chemoproteomic tools such as in situ proteome profiling can do so effectively, but rely heavily on &#8220;tagged&#8217; probes accessible through traditional organic synthesis at a compound&#8217;s reactive sites required for target binding. Late&#8208;stage functionalization may resolve such limitations by &#8220;tagging&#8221; compounds in a single step at biologically inert C&#8208;H bonds. In this viewpoint, we summarize recent advancements in late&#8208;stage C(sp  2  )&#8208;H functionalization of (hetero)arenes, which are present in many natural products, followed by suggesting new toolkits for more wide&#8208;spread use of such strategies to install natural products with next&#8208;generation &#8220;minimalist&#8221; linkers for in situ proteome profiling.</dc:description>

      <title>A Simple Route to the Synthesis of Pt Nanobars and the Mechanistic Understanding of Symmetry Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties. Here we report a facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 by simply reducing a Pt  (IV)  precursor in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) at 160 &#176;C in the presence of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In addition to its commonly observed roles as a solvent and a reductant, DMF could also decompose to generate CO, a capping agent capable of selectively passivating Pt{100} facets to promote the formation of nanobars. The size and aspect ratio of the nanobars could be tuned by varying the amount of Pt  (IV)  precursor involved in the synthesis, as well as the concentration of PVP because of its dual roles as a stabilizer and a co&#8208;reductant. Our mechanistic study indicated that the anisotropic growth resulted from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.</dc:description>

      <title>Bone Tissue Disorders:&#160;Healing Through Coordination Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Osteoporosis, Paget&#8217;s disease and osteosarcoma are a few examples of bone tissue disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions can strictly limit the lifestyle of patients and may even lead to their demise. To prevent this or, at least, try to manage the situation, there are several treatments available on the market. Notwithstanding, research has been driven by the possibility to improve the existing therapies, as well as to find new approaches that could better respond to these diseases.

In this review it is shown the path through which, in recent years, coordination compounds have been prepared and manufactured to be applied in the management of bone tissue disorders. Starting with the design and preparation of the coordination compounds with various dimensionalities, two approaches have been used: (1) they are prepared as three&#8208;dimensional cages that can act as delivery systems for therapeutic substances, or (2) they are constructed/prepared from compounds with intrinsic therapeutic properties. Following this, several strategies have been explored to manufacture the effective delivery to the patients. The versatility of coordination compounds has allowed their use in the preparation of drug tablets, coatings for titanium implants, or even scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In the end, it becomes clear that these compounds can be a valuable approach to reach a better treatment for bone tissue disorders. Nonetheless, along the road, a few bumps have appeared concerning the therapeutic profile, such as the effect of the structural arrangement or particle size.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced electron transfer and ion transport by binary and multidimensional CuCo2S4/Fe2O3 on carbon cloth for water oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>The behavior of electron transfer and ion transport plays a significant role in the electrocatalytic activity. However, the improvement of CuCo  2  S  4  electrocatalytic activity has been a difficult problem lacking of effective electron transfer and ion transport. Herein, the unique structure connects CuCo  2  S  4  nanosheets and carbon cloth (CC) with Fe  2  O  3  nanoparticles to form CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC. Compared with CuCo  2  S  4  /CC, the resistances of electron transfer and ion transport are decreased by 65% and 84% respectively. The electrochemical surface area of CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC is 2.76 times larger than that of CuCo  2  S  4  /CC due to the high double layer capacitance. For an oxygen evolution reaction, CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC can achieve an overpotential of 273 mV and a Tafel slope of 67 mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  in alkaline solution.</dc:description>

      <title>A&#160;Fast, Green and General Route to Ketones from Amides and Organolithium Compounds under Aerobic Conditions: Synthetic and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
      <dc:description>We report that the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic amides by organolithium reagents proceeds quickly (20 s reaction time), efficiently, and chemoselectively with a broad substrate scope in the environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether, at ambient temperature and under air, to provide ketones in up to 93% yield with an effective suppression of the notorious over&#8208;addition reaction. Detailed DFT calculations and NMR investigations support the experimental results. The described methodology was proven to be amenable to scale&#8208;up and recyclability protocols. Contrasting classical procedures carried out under inert atmospheres, this work lays the foundation for a profound paradigm shift of the reactivity of carboxylic acid amides with organolithiums, with ketones being straightforwardly obtained by simply combining the reagents under aerobic conditions and with no need of using previously modified or pre&#8208;activated amides, as recommended.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report that the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic amides by organolithium reagents proceeds quickly (20 s reaction time), efficiently, and chemoselectively with a broad substrate scope in the environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether, at ambient temperature and under air, to provide ketones in up to 93% yield with an effective suppression of the notorious over&#8208;addition reaction. Detailed DFT calculations and NMR investigations support the experimental results. The described methodology was proven to be amenable to scale&#8208;up and recyclability protocols. Contrasting classical procedures carried out under inert atmospheres, this work lays the foundation for a profound paradigm shift of the reactivity of carboxylic acid amides with organolithiums, with ketones being straightforwardly obtained by simply combining the reagents under aerobic conditions and with no need of using previously modified or pre&#8208;activated amides, as recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Polyvalent transition&#8208;state analogues of sialyl substrates strongly inhibit bacterial sialidases.</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial sialidases (SA) are validated drug targets expressed by common human pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae or Clostridium perfringens. Non&#8208;covalent inhibitors of bacterial SA capable of reaching the submicromolar level are rarely reported. We developed multi&#8208; and polyvalent compounds based on the transition state analogue 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;didehydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetylneuraminic (DANA). Poly&#8208;DANA inhibits the catalytic activity of SA from S. pneumoniae (NanA) and the symbiotic microorganism B. thetaiotaomicron (BtSA) at the picomolar and low nanomolar levels when expressed in moles of molecules and of DANA, respectively. Each DANA grafted to the polymer surpasses the inhibitory potential of the monovalent analogue by more than four orders of magnitude, which represents the highest multivalent effect reported so far for an enzyme inhibition. The synergistic interaction was shown to operate in the catalytic domain exclusively, and not in the flanked carbohydrate&#8208;binding module (CBM). These results offers interesting perspectives for the multivalent inhibition of other SA families lacking a CBM, such as viral, parasitic or human SA..</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of gold(I) in the Room Temperature Phosphorescence of ethynylphenanthrene</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of two series of gold(I) complexes containing the general formulae PR  3  &#8208;Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene (PR  3  = PPh  3  (  1a  /  2a  ), PMe  3  (  1b  /  2b  ), PNaph  3  (  1c  /  2c  )) or (diphos)(Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene)  2  (diphos = 1,1&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)methane, dppm (  1d  /  2d  ); 1,4&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)butane, dppb (  1e  /  2e  )) have been synthesized. The two series differ on the position of the alkynyl substituent on the phenanthrene chromophore, being at the 9&#8208;position (9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L1  &#8208;series and at the 2&#8208;position (2&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L2  &#8208;series. The compounds have been fully characterized by  1  H and  31  P NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction resolution in the case of compounds  1a  ,  1e  ,  2a  , and  2c  .
The emissive properties of the uncoordinated ligands and corresponding complexes have been studied in solution and within organic matrixes of different polarity (PMMA and Zeonex). We have observed room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) for all gold(I) complexes while only fluorescence can be detected for the pure organic chromophore. In particular, the  L2  &#8208;series present better luminescent properties regarding intensity of emission, quantum yields and RTP effect. Additionally, while the inclusion of all the compounds in organic matrixes induces an enhancement of the observed RTP due to the decrease in non&#8208;radiative deactivation, only the  L2  &#8208;series completely supress fluorescence giving rise to pure phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Imprints Frozen by Strong Intermolecular Interactions in Place of Cross&#8208;linking</title>
      <dc:description>A new way to freeze molecular imprints in a polymer material is reported.

      <title>Chemical and Genetic Studies on the Formation of Pyrrolones During the Biosynthesis of Cytochalasans</title>
      <dc:description>A key step during the biosynthesis of cytochalasans is a proposed Knoevenagel condensation to form the pyrrolone core, enabling the subsequent 4+2 cycloaddition reaction that results in the characteristic octahydroisoindolone motif of all cytochalasans. Here we investigate the role of the highly conserved alpha&#8208;beta &#8208;hydrolase enzymes PyiE and ORFZ during the biosynthesis of pyrichalasin H and the ACE1 metabolite respectively, using gene knockout and complementation techniques. Using synthetic aldehyde models we demonstrate that the Knoevenagel condensation proceeds spontaneously but results in the 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer, rather than the required 1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer.

Gemini reactions: In their Full Paper on page&#8197;13797&#8197;ff., G. Chaubet et al. have investigated the potential of Ugi and Passerini multicomponent reactions for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of native trastuzumab.

      <title>Evaluation of the DNA Alkylation Property of a Chlorambucil&#8208;Conjugated Cyclic Pyrrole&#8211;Imidazole Polyamide</title>
      <dc:description>Hairpin pyrrole&#8211;imidazole polyamides (hPIPs) and their chlorambucil (Chb) conjugates (hPIP&#8211;Chbs) can alkylate DNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner, and have been studied as anticancer drugs. Here we conjugated Chb to a cyclic PIP (cPIP), which is known to have a higher binding affinity than the corresponding hPIP, and investigated the DNA alkylation properties of the cPIP&#8211;Chb using the optimized capillary electrophoresis method and conventional HPLC product analysis. cPIP&#8211;Chb conjugate  3  showed higher alkylation activity at its binding sites than did hPIP&#8211;Chb conjugates  1  and  2  . Subsequent HPLC analysis revealed that the alkylation site of conjugate  3  , which was identified by capillary electrophoresis, was reliable and that conjugate  3  alkylates the N3 position of adenine as do hPIP&#8211;Chbs. Moreover, conjugate  3  showed higher cytotoxicity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells than did conjugate  1  and cytotoxicity comparable to that of conjugate  2  . These results suggest that cPIP&#8211;Chbs could be novel DNA alkylating anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the Deactivation Pathways of Iridium(III) Pyridine&#8208;Carboxiamide Catalysts for Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>The degradation pathways of highly active [Cp*Ir(&#954; 2 &#8208; N,N &#8208;R&#8208;pica)Cl] catalysts (pica = picolinamidate; 1 R = H, 2 R = Me) for formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Under acidic conditions (1 eq. of HNO 3 ), 2 undergoes partial protonation of the amide moiety, inducing rapid &#954; 2 &#8208; N,N to &#954; 2 &#8208; N,O ligand isomerization. Consistently, DFT modelling on the simpler complex 1 showed that the &#954; 2 &#8208; N,N key intermediate of FA dehydrogenation ( I NH ), bearing a N&#8208;protonated pica, can easily transform into the &#954; 2 &#8208; N,O analogue ( I NH2 ; &#916; G # &#8776; 11 kcal/mol, &#916; G &#8776; &#8208;5 kcal/mol). Intramolecular hydrogen liberation from I NH2 is predicted to be rather prohibitive (&#916; G # &#8776; 26 kcal/mol, &#916; G &#8776; 23 kcal/mol), indicating that FA dehydrogenation should involve mostly &#954; 2 &#8208; N,N intermediates, at least at relatively high pH. Under FA dehydrogenation conditions, 2 was progressively consumed, and the vast majority of the Ir centers (58%) was eventually found in the form of Cp*&#8208;complexes with a pyridine&#8208;amine ligand. This likely derived from hydrogenation of the pyridine&#8208;carboxiamide via a hemiaminal intermediate, which could be also detected. Clear evidence for ligand hydrogenation being the main degradation pathway also for 1 was obtained, as further confirmed by spectroscopic and catalytic tests on the independently synthesized degradation product 1c . DFT calculations confirmed that this side reaction is kinetically and thermodynamically accessible.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme multifunctionality via control of substrate positioning within the catalytic cycle &#8208; a QM/MM study for clavaminic acid synthase</title>
      <dc:description>Clavaminate synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus is an Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, crucial for the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid.

As follows from the results of this QM/MM study, CAS versatility and selectivity depends on the binding cavity, which interplays differently with substrate for each reaction. The enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions affect the substrate&#8217;s ability to re&#8208;position during the reaction, either constraining it in its primary position, which impedes processes other than oxygen rebound, or allowing change, which facilitates double bond formation. This differential effect originates from two aspartate residues, which strongly interact with the guanidine group of the hydroxylation substrate and stabilise orientation of the molecule. These residues interact less effectively with a smaller amine group of the desaturation substrate(s), aiding their repositioning and subsequent formation of a double bond.</dc:description>

      <title>New Luminescent Tetranuclear Lanthanide&#8208;Based Silsesquioxane Cage&#8208;Like Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based silsesquioxane cages: An association of coordination and sol&#8208;gel chemistries is a powerful tool to design new functional materials. A new family of tetranuclear lanthanide&#8208;based cage&#8208;like silsesquioxanes with unusual prism&#8208;like topology was readily obtained. They exhibit efficient Eu3+ or Tb3+ characteristic emissions in solid state, which makes them the first luminescent cage&#8208;like silsesquioxanes. More information can be found in the Communication by A.&#8197;N.&#8197;Bilyachenko, J.&#8197;Larionova et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003351).

They exhibit efficient Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; characteristic emissions in solid state, which makes them the first luminescent cage&#8208;like silsesquioxanes.

Red and blue&#8208;shifts (depicted by the light intensity of the chandeliers and the background curtain) are explained in this work via real&#8208;space methods and (H2O)2 as an archetype. Two interatomic isosurfaces support the ground (down) and excited states (up) of (H2O)2. These states are linked by ribbons whose torsion represents the inversion of the dipole moment due to photoexcitations. The water containers (bottom) denote the H&#8208;bond responsible for these shifts. The artwork is due to Dr. Victor&#8197;Duarte Alaniz. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.

The amplification of the solid&#8208;state quantum yield of a thiophosphoranyl anthracene has been achieved by simple host&#8211;guest complex formation with small arenes. Weak interactions between the chromophore and the aromatic guest molecule led to a change in the solid&#8208;state structure and an enhancement of the overall rigidity.

      <title>Reversibly Switchable Phase&#8208;Dependent Emission of Quinoline and Phenothiazine Derivatives Towards Applications in Optical Sensing and Information Multi&#8208;Coding</title>

The compounds with phenylene linker showed outstanding phase&#8208;dependent reversibility between ON/OFF stages (low and high emission intensity, drastic shifting of emission colors, short&#8208; and long&#8208;lived fluorescence) under systematic grinding&#8208;fuming cycles required for multichannel memory devices based on optical information multi&#8208;coding. The conformational diversity of phenothiazine unit endowed dual emission of the doped films implemented by the different luminescent mechanisms with peaks located at 414/530 nm, 416/540 nm and 440/582 nm. The presence of phenylene linker and thus two rotational degrees of freedom resulted in quenching of delayed fluorescence of quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers in the solid state. The compound containing no phenylene bridge was characterized by two different driving photoluminescence mechanisms of the doped films: short fluorescence of quasi&#8208;axial conformer and TADF of quasi&#8208;equatorial form.

      <title>A Functional Hexaphenylbenzene Library Comprising of One, Three and Six Peripheral Rylene&#8208;Diimide Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a series of rylene&#8208;diimide substituted hexaphenylbenzenes (HPBs) is presented. The direct connection of the rylene&#8208;diimide units to the HPBs  via  the imide&#8208;N&#8208;position without any linkers as well as the use of naphthalene&#8208;diimides (NDIs) next to perylene&#8208;diimides (PDIs) is unprecedented. While mono&#8208;substituted products were obtained by imidization reactions with amino&#8208;HPB and the respective rylene&#8208;monoimides, key step for the formation of tri&#8208; and hexa&#8208;substituted HPBs is the Co&#8208;catalysed cyclotrimerization. Particular emphasis of the photophysical characterization was the influence of the number of the NDI/PDI units per HPB and the overall substitution pattern. Lastly, Scholl oxidation was applied to generate the corresponding hexa&#8208;  peri  &#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Importantly, the efficiency of the transformation strongly depends on the number of NDI/PDI units. While three rylene&#8208;diimide units already hinder the Scholl reaction, successful synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted HBCs is possible.</dc:description>

While mono&#8208;substituted products were obtained by imidization reactions with amino&#8208;HPB and the respective rylene&#8208;monoimides, key step for the formation of tri&#8208; and hexa&#8208;substituted HPBs is the Co&#8208;catalysed cyclotrimerization. Particular emphasis of the photophysical characterization was the influence of the number of the NDI/PDI units per HPB and the overall substitution pattern. Lastly, Scholl oxidation was applied to generate the corresponding hexa&#8208;  peri  &#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Importantly, the efficiency of the transformation strongly depends on the number of NDI/PDI units. While three rylene&#8208;diimide units already hinder the Scholl reaction, successful synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted HBCs is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An Organometallic Gold(I) Bis&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex with Multimodal Activity in Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A cationic AuI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex featuring caffeine&#8208;based ligands has shown potent and selective anticancer effects in ovarian cancer cells. This organogold compound is remarkably stable in physiological conditions. Therefore, the observed therapeutic effects are mainly due to non&#8208;covalent interactions of the gold compound with its pharmacological targets. Among the latter, DNA secondary structures&#8212;G&#8208;quadruplexes&#8212;play a pivotal role in the mechanisms of anticancer action. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;M. Meier&#8208;Menches, A. Casini, C. Gerner, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003495).

      <dc:description>Alkylation of spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,3&#8217;&#8208;indazole] at N(1) and N(2) with t BuCl affords the nitrenium cations [C 6 H 4 N 2 ( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )][BF 4 ], 1 and 2 , respectively. Compound 1 converts to 2 over the temperature range 303&#8208;323 K, with a free energy barrier of 28 &#177; 5 kcal/mol. Reaction of 1 with PMe 3 afforded the N&#8208;bound phosphine adduct [C 6 H 4 N( t Bu)N(PMe 3 )C(C 12 H 8 )]BF 4 ] 3 . However, phosphines attack 2 at the para&#8208; carbon atom of the aryl group with concurrent cleavage of N(2)&#8208;C(1) bond and proton migration to C(1) affording [(R 3 P)C 6 H 3 NN( t Bu)CH(C 12 H 8 )][BF 4 ] (R = Me 4 , n Bu 5 ). Analogous reactions of 1 and 2 with the carbene SIMes prompt attack at the para&#8208; carbon with concurrent loss of H&#8226; affording the radical cation salts [(SIMes)C 6 H 3 N( t Bu)NC(C 12 H 8 )&#8226;][BF 4 ] 6 and [(SIMes)C 6 H 3 NN( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )&#8226;][BF 4 ] 7 , whereas reaction of 2 with BAC gives the Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct, [C 6 H 4 N(BAC)N( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )][BF 4 ] 8 . Finally, reactions of 1 and 2 with KPPh 2 result in electron transfer affording (PPh 2 ) 2 and the persistent radicals C 6 H 4 N( t Bu)NC(C 12 H 8 )&#8226; and C 6 H 4 NN( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )&#8226;. The detailed reaction mechanisms are also explored by extensive DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfonated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
      <dc:description>Open 1D channels found in covalent organic frameworks are unique and promising to serve as pathways for proton conduction; how to develop high&#8208;rate yet stable transporting systems remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a strategy for exploring proton&#8208;conducting frameworks by engineering pore walls and installing proton&#8208;containing polymers into the pores. Amide&#8208;linked and sulfonated frameworks were synthesized from imine&#8208;linked precursors via sequentially engineering to oxidize into amide linkages and to further anchor sulfonic acid groups onto the pore walls, enabling the creation of sulfonated frameworks with high crystallinity and channel ordering. Integrating sulfonated polyether ether ketone chains into the open channels enables proton hopping to across the channels, greatly increases proton conductivity and enables a stable continuous run. These results suggest a way to explore proton&#8208;conducting COFs via systematic engineering of wall and space of the open nanochannels.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Cyanine dyes carrying quinoline moieties are an important class of organic molecules having a great interest and applications in many fields like medicine, pharmacology, and engineering. Despite their exceptional properties, such as stability, high molar extinction coefficients, and high pH&#8208;sensitivity, this class of dyes has been less analyzed and reviewed for the last decades.

      <title>Isoindolinone Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Type Transition Metal Catalyzed C&#8208;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Isoindolinone structure is an important privileged scaffold found in a large variety of naturally occurring as well as synthetic, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Owing to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, the synthetic strategies can be divided into two categories: First, direct utilization of phthalimides or phthalimidines as starting materials for the synthesis of isoindolinones; and second, construction of the lactam and/or aromatic rings by different catalytic methods, including C&#8208;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling, carbonylation, condensation, addition and formal cycloaddition reactions. Especially in the last mentioned, utilization of transition metal catalysts provides access to a broad range of substituted isoindolinones. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8208;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8208;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.</dc:description>

Owing to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, the synthetic strategies can be divided into two categories: First, direct utilization of phthalimides or phthalimidines as starting materials for the synthesis of isoindolinones; and second, construction of the lactam and/or aromatic rings by different catalytic methods, including C&#8208;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling, carbonylation, condensation, addition and formal cycloaddition reactions. Especially in the last mentioned, utilization of transition metal catalysts provides access to a broad range of substituted isoindolinones. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8208;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8208;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Activation of Molecular Oxygen by a Cobalt(II) tetra&#8208;NHC Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The first dicobalt(III) &#181;2&#8208;peroxo N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex is reported. It can be quantitatively generated from a cobalt(II) compound bearing a 16&#8208;membered macrocyclic tetra&#8208;NHC ligand via facile activation of dioxygen from air at ambient conditions. The reaction proceeds via an end&#8208;on superoxo intermediate as demonstrated by EPR studies and DFT. The peroxo moiety can be cleaved upon addition of acetic acid, yielding the corresponding Co(III) acetate complex going along with H2O2 formation. In contrast, both Co(II) and Co(III) complexes are also studied as catalysts to utilize air for olefin and alkane oxidation reactions, however not resulting in product formation. The observations are rationalized by DFT&#8209;calculations, suggesting a nucleophilic nature of the dicobalt(III) &#181;2&#8208;peroxo complex. All isolated compounds are characterized by NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, elemental analysis, EPR and SC&#8208;XRD.</dc:description>

      <title>A Light&#8208;Harvesting/Charge&#8208;Separation Model with Energy Gradient Made of Assemblies of meta&#8208;pyridyl&#160;Zinc Porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of porphyrins is a fascinating topic not only for mimicking chlorophyll assemblies in photosynthetic organisms but also for the potential of creating molecular&#8208;level devices. Herein we have prepared zinc porphyrin derivatives bearing a&#160;meta&#8208;pyridyl group at the&#160;meso&#8208;position and studied their assemblies in chloroform. Among porphyrins studied, one with a carbamoylpyridyl moiety (ZnPPyC) gave distinct&#160;1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3, which allowed us to probe the supramolecular structure in solution in detail. Ring&#8208;current induced chemical shift changes in&#160;1H NMR, together with vapor pressure osmometry and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, among other evidence, suggested that the porphyrin molecules form a trimer in a triangular cone structure. Further incorporation of a directly&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;ferrocene dyads with the same assembling properties in the assemblies lead to a rare light&#8208;harvesting/charge&#8208;separation model, in which an energy gradient is incorporated and reductive quenching occurs.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual emission of meso&#8208;phenyleneethynylene&#8208;BODIPY oligomers. Synthesis, photophysics and theoretical optoelectronic study</title>

The multiplicity and J&#8208;coupling constants of  1  H,  11  B  19  F/  11  B NMR signals revealed, in the  nPEC4&#8208;By  series, that the phenyl in meso position of the BODIPY becomes electronically part of the conjugation of the phenyleneethynylene chain, while By is electronically isolated. The photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical studies confirm this finding as the properties of  nPEC4&#8208;By  are comparable to those of the  nPEC4&#8208;X  oligomers and  By  , indicating negligible electron communication between BODIPy and the nPEC4 moieties. Yet, Energy Transfer (ET) from nPEC4 to By was rationalized by spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;Soai&#8242;s asymmetric autocatalysis is one of the most fascinating reactions because it exhibits an extraordinary nonlinear effect in asymmetric catalysis and can reliably amplify even the smallest enantiomeric excess. The elucidation of the reaction mechanism is of fundamental importance to transfer the knowledge to other reactions&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

      <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis: An Interactive Tool to Uncover Unorthodox Mechanisms in Polyether Cascade Cyclizations</title>
      <dc:description>
One of the hidden enigmas of natural&#8208;product inspired epoxide&#8208;opening polyether cascade cyclizations is the inversion of configuration from trans epoxides to cis&#8208;fused endo products. Here, pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis is introduced as an interactive tool to find the answer with an unorthodox mechanism centered around an acyclic, achiral hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;enal intermediate, produced by C&#8722;C bond cleavage, then cyclized by stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis and supramolecular &#963;&#8208;hole catalysis in general is currently being introduced as the non&#8208;covalent counterpart of covalent Lewis acid catalysis. With access to anti&#8208;Baldwin cyclizations identified as unique characteristic, pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis appeared promising to elucidate one of the hidden enigmas of brevetoxin&#8208;type epoxide opening polyether cascade cyclizations, that is the cyclization of certain trans epoxides into cis&#8208;fused rings. In principle, a shift from SN2&#8208; to SN1&#8208;type mechanisms could suffice to rationalize this inversion of configuration. However, the same inversion could be explained by a completely different mechanism: Ring opening with C&#8722;C bond cleavage into a branched hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;enal and the corresponding cyclic hemiacetal, followed by cascade cyclization under conformational control, including stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation. In this report, a pnictogen&#8208;bonding supramolecular SbV catalyst is used to demonstrate that this unorthodox polyether cascade cyclization mechanism occurs.

      <title>Photoactive nickel complexes in cross coupling catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions are important in chemical synthesis for the formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Suitable catalysts are frequently based on palladium or nickel, and lately the cheaper and more abundant first&#8208;row transition metal element has been much in focus. The combination of nickel catalysis with photoredox chemistry has opened new synthetic possibilities, and in some cases electronically excited states of nickel complexes play a key role. This is a remarkable finding, because photo&#8208;excited metal complexes are underexplored in the context of organic bond&#8208;forming reactions, and because the photophysics and the photochemistry of first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are underdeveloped in comparison to their precious metal&#8208;based congeners. Consequently, there is much potential for innovation at the interface of synthetic&#8208;organic and physical&#8208;inorganic chemistry. This minireview highlights recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis and identifies essential concepts for the exploitation of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions are important in chemical synthesis for the formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Suitable catalysts are frequently based on palladium or nickel, and lately the cheaper and more abundant first&#8208;row transition metal element has been much in focus. The combination of nickel catalysis with photoredox chemistry has opened new synthetic possibilities, and in some cases electronically excited states of nickel complexes play a key role. This is a remarkable finding, because photo&#8208;excited metal complexes are underexplored in the context of organic bond&#8208;forming reactions, and because the photophysics and the photochemistry of first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are underdeveloped in comparison to their precious metal&#8208;based congeners. Consequently, there is much potential for innovation at the interface of synthetic&#8208;organic and physical&#8208;inorganic chemistry. This minireview highlights recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis and identifies essential concepts for the exploitation of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>A fluorine&#8208;containing tetrasubstituted stereogenic center is a highly valued structural feature in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we describe the direct coupling of achiral &#945;&#8208;fluoronitriles and aldehydes promoted by a chiral Cu(I)/Barton&#8217;s base catalytic system, delivering &#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles with satisfactory stereoselection. The stereochemical course was positively biased by the combined use of asymmetrical achiral thiourea as a supplementary ligand for Cu(I), which significantly enhanced the stereoselectivity.

      <title>Synthetic processes towards nitriles without cyanide: A biocatalytic concept based on dehydration of aldoximes in water</title>
      <dc:description>While belonging to the most fundamental functional groups, nitriles represent a class of compound still raising challenges in terms of an efficient, cost&#8208;effective and at the same time sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes recently a cyanide&#8208;free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, these Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the desired nitrile products. Within this concept article these developments with such enzymes are summarized with a strong focus on the synthetic application side. By means of the achieved synthetic examples, it will be demonstrated that this biocatalytic technology has the potential to &#8220;cross the bridge&#8221; between the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals on the one hand and bulk and commodity chemicals on the other hand. For example, Oxd enzymes were found to give high enantioselectivities and can give access to both enantiomers when starting either from the (  E  )&#8208; or (  Z  )&#8208;aldoxime racemate. However, besides their high potential towards stereoselective synthesis making the attractive for the area of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, Oxd enzymes also turned out to suitable for the dehydration of a range of aldoximes derived from aliphatic achiral commodity chemicals, leading to the corresponding nitriles, e.g., adiponitrile and fatty nitriles, with high substrate loading up to the Kg per L range as a required criteria for the field of bulk chemicals production.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Light&#8208;responsive molecular systems with multiple photoswitches in  C  3  symmetric designs have enormous application potential. The design part of such molecular systems is critical due to its influence in several properties associated with the photoswitches.

      <title>A pH&#8208;Induced, Reversible Conformational Switch able to control the Photocurrent Efficiency in a Peptide Supramolecular System</title>
      <dc:description>External stimuli are potent tools that Nature uses to control protein function and activity. For instance, during viral entry and exit, pH variations are known to trigger large protein conformational changes. In Nature, also the electron transfer (ET) properties of ET proteins are influenced by pH&#8208;induced conformational changes. In this work, a pH&#8208;controlled, reversible 3  10  &#8208;helix to &#945;&#8208;helix conversion (from acidic to highly basic pH values and  vice versa  ) of a peptide supramolecular system built on a gold surface is described. The effect of pH on the ability of the peptide SAM to generate a photocurrent was investigated, with particular focus on the effect of the pH&#8208;induced conformational change on photocurrent efficiency. The films were characterized by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, and were found to be very stable over time, also in contact with a solution. They were also able to generate current under illumination, with an efficiency that is the highest recorded so far with biomolecular systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A panchromatic triad, consisting of benzothiazole (BTZ), boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moieties covalently linked to zinc porphyrin (ZnP) core is reported. Absorption and electrochemical studies of BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP revealed characteristic peaks corresponding to individual chromophores. Selective excitation of BTZ moiety resulted in the fluorescence quenching, due to PEnT from 1BTZ* to BODIPY moiety, followed by the quenching of the BODIPY emission due to sequential PEnT from 1BODIPY* moiety to ZnP. Further, supramolecular tetrad was formed by axially coordinating triad with ImC60, and the parallel steady&#8208;state measurements revealed diminished ZnP emission indicating the occurrence of PET from 1ZnP* to ImC60. Finally, femtosecond transient absorption studies provided evidence for the sequential occurrence of PEnT and PET events, viz., 1BTZ*&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;1BODIPY*&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;1ZnP*:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP+&#9642;:ImC60&#8722;&#9642; in the supramolecular tetrad. The evaluated rate of energy transfer, kEnT was found to be 3&#8208;5 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1, slightly faster than that observed in the case of BODIPY&#8208;ZnP and BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP lacking the coordinated ImC60. The rate constants for charge separation and recombination, kCS and kCR, calculated by monitoring the rise and decay of the C60&#8722;&#9642; were found to be 5.5 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1 and 4.4 &#215; 108 s&#8208;1 for BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 triad, and 3.1 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1 and 4.9 &#215; 108 s&#8208;1 for BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 tetrad.

      <title>Selection of Planar Chiral Conformations between Pillar[5, 6]arenes Induced by Amino Acid Derivatives in Aqueous Media</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids play critical roles in the metabolic process in nearly all life forms.

      <title>Completing the Redox&#8208;Series of Silicon Trisdioxolene: ortho&#8208;Quinone and Lewis Superacid Make a Powerful Redox Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Quinones are mild oxidants, whose redox potentials can be increased by supramolecular interactions. Whereas this goal has been achieved by hydrogen bonding or molecular encapsulation, a Lewis acid&#8208;binding strategy for redox amplification of quinones is unexplored. Herein, we study the redox chemistry of silicon tris(perchloro)dioxolene 1 &#8211; the formal adduct of ortho&#8208;perchloroquinone QCl with the Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane 2. By isolating the single&#8208;electron reduced product of 1, the anionic monoradical 1&#9679;&#8208;, we complete the redox&#8208;series of a century&#8208;old class of compounds. Cyclic voltammetry measurements reveal that the redox potential in 1 is shifted by more than 1 V into the anodic direction compared to QCl, reaching that of "magic blue" or NO+. It allows oxidation of challenging substrates such as aromatic hydrocarbons and can be applied as an efficient redox catalyst. Remarkably, this powerful reagent forms in situ by combining the two commercially available precursors SiI4 and QCl.</dc:description>

      <title>Plasma&#8208;induced defects enhance the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity of MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 for overall water splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Defect engineering in metal&#8208;organic frameworks is commonly performed by using thermal or chemical treatments. Herein, it is reported that oxygen plasma treatment generates structural defects on MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  leading to an increase of its photocatalytic activity. Characterization data indicates that plasma&#8208;treated materials retain most of their initial crystallinity, while exhibiting somewhat lower surface area and pore volume. XPS and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy reveal that oxygen plasma induces MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  partial terephthalate decarboxylation and an increase of the Ti&#8208;OH population. Thermogravimetric analyses confirm the generation of structural defects by oxygen plasma and allowed an estimation of the resulting experimental formula of the treated MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  solids. SEM analyses show that the oxygen plasma treatment of MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  gradually decreases its particle size. Importantly, diffuse reflectance UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and valence band measurements demonstrate that oxygen&#8208;plasma treatment alters MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  band gap and, more significantly, the alignment of highest occupy and lowest unoccupied crystal orbitals. An optimal oxygen plasma treatment to achieve the highest efficiency in water splitting with or without methanol as sacrificial electron donor under UV&#8208;Vis or simulated sunlight was determined. The optimized plasma&#8208;treated MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  photocatalyst acts as truly heterogeneous photocatalysts and retains most of its initial photoactivity and crystallinity upon reuse.</dc:description>

      <title>Glycine&#8208;Functionalized CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis of CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Capping ligands are indispensable for the preparation of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite (MHP) nanocrystals (NCs) with good stability; however, the long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands in conventional MHP NCs will be unfavourable for the CO2 adsorption and hinder the efficient carrier separation on the surface of MHP NCs, leading to inferior catalytic activity in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, we construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with short&#8208;chain glycine as ligand based on a facile ligand&#8208;exchange strategy. Owing to the reduced hindrance of glycine and the presence of amine group in glycine, the photogenerated carrier separation and CO2 uptake capacity can be noticeably improved without compromising stability of MHP NCs. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with glycine ligands exhibit significantly increased yield of 27.7 &#956;mol g&#8210;1 h&#8210;1 for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion without any organic sacrificial reagents, which is over 5 times higher than that of control CsPbBr3 NCs with conventional long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Assessing the key photophysical properties of triangulenium dyes for DNA binding by alteration of the fluorescent core</title>
      <dc:description>Four&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA is a non&#8208;canonical DNA topology that has been proposed to form in cells and play key roles in how the genome is read and used by the cellular machinery. Previously, a fluorescent triangulenium probe (DAOTA&#8208;M2) was used to visualise G4s in cellulo, thanks to its distinct fluorescence lifetimes when bound to different DNA topologies. Herein, we expand the library of available triangulenium probes to explore how modifications to the fluorescent core of the molecule affect its photophysical characteristics, interaction with DNA and cellular localisation. The benzo&#8208;bridged and isopropyl&#8208;bridged diazatriangulenium dyes, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 respectively, featuring ethyl&#8208;morpholino substituents, were synthesised and characterised. The interactions of these molecules with different DNA topologies were studied to determine their binding affinity, fluorescence enhancement and fluorescence lifetime response. Finally, the cellular uptake and localisation of these optical probes were investigated. Whilst structural modifications to the triangulenium core only slightly alter the binding affinity to DNA, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 cannot distinguish between DNA topologies through their fluorescence lifetime. This work presents valuable new evidence into the critical role of PET quenching when using the fluorescence lifetime of triangulenium dyes to discriminate G4 DNA from duplex DNA, highlighting the importance of fine tuning redox and spectral properties when developing new triangulenium&#8208;based G4 probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and coordination ability of a donor&#8208;stabilised bis&#8208;phosphinidene</title>
      <dc:description>Chelating phosphines have long been a mainstay as efficient directing ligands in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Low&#8208;valent derivatives, namely chelating phosphinidenes, are to date unknown, and could lead to chelating complexes containing more than one metal centre due to the intrisic capacity of phosphinidenes to bind two metal fragments at one P&#8208;centre. Here we describe the synthesis of the first such chelating bis&#8208;phosphinidene ligand, XantP  2  (  2  ), generated by the reduction of a diphosphino xanthene derivative, Xant(PH  2  )  2  (  1  ) with  iPr  NHC (  iPr  NHC = [:C{N(Pr  i  )C(H)}  2  ]). Initial studies have shown that this novel chelating ligand can act as a bidentate ligand towards element dihalides (  i.e.  FeCl  2  , ZnI  2  , GeCl  2  , SnBr  2  ), forming cationic complexes with the tetryl elements. In contrast, XantP  2  demonstrates an ability to bind multiple metal centres in the reaction with CuCl, leading to a cationic Cu  3  P  3  ring complex, with Cu centres bridged by phosphinidene arms. Density Functional Theory calculations show that  2  indeed holds 4 lone pairs of electrons, shedding further light on the coordination capacity for this novel ligand class through observation of directionality and hybridisation of these electron pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Dirhodium Complexes as Panchromatic Sensitizers, Electrocatalysts, and Photocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Dinuclear rhodium complexes are attractive candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers and photocatalysts. Modification of the coordination sphere of the Rh  2  (II,II) compounds results in photophysical and redox properties that are highly desirable for electro&#8208; and photocatalysis. Specifically, Rh  2  (II,II) complexes have shown promising catalytic activity towards proton reduction to generate H  2  , a clean fuel, and for the selective reduction of CO  2  to HCOOH. In addition, paddlewheel Rh  2  (II,II) complexes provide robust platforms for the design of efficient and stable single&#8208;component photocatalysts. Optimization of the Rh  2  (II,II) catalysts is crucial to realize their future application in devices or systems designed for the production of fuels from sunlight.</dc:description>

      <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicons in Organic Molecules As Carbenoid&#8208;Type Amphoteric Centers: A Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing a stable compound with a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) center is a challenging goal for chemists. Here, we theoretically designed and computationally verified a series of potential aromatic ptSi compounds composed of four conjugated rings shared by a centrally embedded Si atom. Both Born&#8208;Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations and computations of decomposition pathways indicate the high stability and likely existence of these compounds particularly Si&#8208;5555 (SiN  4  C  8  H  8  ) with 16 &#960; electrons under normal temperature and pressure. Notably, the H&#252;ckel aromaticity rule which works well for single rings seems inconsistent with the high stability of Si&#8208;5555 where the 16 &#960; electrons are spread over four rings fused together. Bonding analyses show that the strong electron donation from the peripheral conjugated ring of 16 &#960; electrons to the vacant central atomic orbital Si 3p  z  leads to the stabilization for both the ptSi coordination and planar aromaticity. The partial occupation of Si 3p  z  results in the peculiar  carbenoid&#8208;type  behaviors of the amphoteric center. By modulating the electron density on the ring with substituent groups, we can regulate the nucleophilic and electrophilic properties of the central Si.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational design and controlled synthesis of V doped Ni3S2/NixPy heterostructure nanosheets for hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Rational construction of high&#8208;efficient and low&#8208;cost catalyst is one of the most promising ways to produce liberally hydrogen but almost remains a huge dare. Hence, a novel work by the interface engineering and hetero&#8208;atom doping to synthesize V doped sulfide/phosphide heterostructure grown on nickel foam (V&#8208;Ni  3  S  2  /Ni  x  P  y  /NF) is proposed via a phosphating treatment at low temperature. The incorporation of V can adjust the electronic structures of Ni  3  S  2  , optimize electronic transmission, expose more active sites and protect the 3D structure of Ni foam. Meanwhile, the excellent conductivity of NF and the abundant interstices between nanosheets have a positive effort for HER. As a result, the V&#8208;Ni  3  S  2  /Ni  x  P  y  /NF (VNSP/NF) nanosheets catalyst exhibits the outstanding HER activity with an extremely low overpotential of 90 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  for HER and stable durability in alkaline solution, which exceeds most of the previously reported about Ni&#8208;based materials. This work proves the rational design of the interfacial engineering and metal atom incorporation have a significant influence for efficient hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystal structure of urotropine under high pressure and non&#8208;hydrostatic stress&#8208;induced phase transitions in cage compounds</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;pressure behavior of hexamethylenetetramine (urotropine) was studied  in situ  using angle&#8208;dispersive single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy. Experiments were conducted in various pressure transmitting media to study the effect of deviatoric stress on phase transformations. Up to 4 GPa significant damping of molecular librations and atomic thermal motion was observed. A first&#8208;order phase transition to a tetragonal structure was observed with an onset at ~12.5 GPa which is characterized by sluggish kinetics and considerable hysteresis upon decompression. However, it occurs only in non&#8208;hydrostatic conditions, induced by deviatoric or uniaxial stress in the sample. This behavior finds analogies in similar cubic crystals built of highly symmetric cage&#8208;like molecules and may be considered a common feature of such systems. DFT computations were performed to model urotropine equation of state and pressure dependence of vibrational modes. The first successful Hirshfeld atom refinements carried out for high&#8208;pressure diffraction data are reported. The refinements yielded more realistic C&#8722;H bond lengths than the independent atom model despite the high&#8208;pressure diffraction data are incomplete.</dc:description>
