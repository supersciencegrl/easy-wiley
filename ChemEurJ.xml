         <title>Concentration&#8208;, Temperature&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly: Merocyanine Dimerization as a Showcase Example for Obtaining Reliable Thermodynamic Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mathematical models for the concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent analysis of self&#8208;assembly equilibria are derived for the most simple case of dimer formation, to highlight the assumptions these models and the thus determined thermodynamic parameters are based on. The three models were applied to UV/Vis absorption data for the dimerization of a highly dipolar merocyanine dye in 1,4&#8208;dioxane. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) dilution experiments were performed as an independent reference technique. While the concentration&#8208;dependent analysis is according to our studies the most reliable method, also the less time&#8208;consuming temperature&#8208;dependent evaluation can give accurate results in the present example, despite small thermochromic effects. In contrast, the strong negative solvatochromism of the merocyanine tampers with the results from the solvent&#8208;dependent evaluation. Even though the studies presented in this work are limited to the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium of a dipolar dye, the basic principles can be transferred to other chromophores and different self&#8208;assembly models, including those for supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibodies Directed Against GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyrosine Posttranslational Modifications &#8211; a New Tool for Glycoproteomic Detection</title>

Catch as catch can. Fmoc&#8208;SPPS &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr amino acid building blocks were prepared and applied in synthesis of glycopeptide vaccine constructs and an extensive Tyr&#8208;modified glycopeptide library. Antibodies were raised and affinity purified against the antigen peptides. Evaluation by ELISA, glycopeptide microarrays and by western blot analysis showed high antibody specificity towards GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications without cross reactivity to the corresponding Ser or Thr glycopeptides.







Abstract
In the last decade, it was discovered that protein mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and O&#8208;GlcNAcylation modify Tyr residues besides the well explored Thr and Ser amino acids. Several glycoproteomic studies have identified &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications, and studies propose that &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr also exists as a new group of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Specific bacterial toxins have further been identified to modify host GTPases with &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr to promote bacterial virulence. Despite being identified on numerous proteins, the biological roles, biosynthesis and expression of GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications are poorly understood. A major obstacle is the lack of tools to specifically detect and identify proteins containing these modifications. With this in mind, we prepared vaccine constructs and raised antibodies to enable selective detection of proteins carrying these new PTMs. The obtained polyclonal antibody sera were evaluated using ELISA and glycopeptide microarrays and were found to be highly selective for GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr glycopeptides over the corresponding Ser&#8208; and Thr&#8208;modifications. For microarray analysis, synthetic GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr Fmoc&#8208;amino acids were prepared and applied in Fmoc&#8208;SPPS to obtain an extensive O&#8208;glycopeptide library. After affinity purification, the antibodies were applied in western blot analysis and showed specific detection of &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modified RhoA GTPase.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis allows for a simple and benign reaction set&#8208;up using water as the solvent without the need for oxygen&#8208;removing protocols. Blue light (456&#8197;nm) is absorbed by the photocatalyst and allows the [2+2] photocycloaddition to occur between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes. The observed reactivity for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is completely turned on by the use of a micellar solution as opposed to organic solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. N&#230;sborg and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300627).

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycles with Triplet Carbenes by means of an Unexpected 1,2&#8208;Alkyl Radical Migration

A triplet carbene is involved in the C3&#8208;H functionalization of indole heterocycles. We herein describe a combined experimental and computational study on this reaction and unveil an unexpected 1,2&#8208;alkyl radical migration pathway.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization of indole heterocycles constitutes a key strategy to leverage the synthesis of endogenous signaling molecules such as tryptamine or tryptophol. Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with indole, which shows an unusual solvent dependency. While C2&#8208;functionalization occurs under protic conditions, the use of aprotic solvents leads to a complete reversal of selectivity and exclusive C3&#8208;functionalization occurs. To rationalize for this unexpected reactivity switch, we have conducted detailed theoretical and experimental studies, which suggest the participation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes initial C2&#8208;functionalization. A distinct cationic [1,2]&#8208;alkyl radical migration then leads to formation of C3&#8208;functionalized indole. We conclude with the application of this photocatalytic reaction to access oxidized tryptophol derivatives including gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization reactions.

         <title>Sila[1]ruthenocenophanes: Long Sought&#8208;After Family Members</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes were developed into an important class of monomers with the Me2Si&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophane being the most applied member. Surprisingly, the strained ruthenocene analogues are unknown. We now solved this mystery and reveal why sila[1]ruthenocenophanes are so challenging to prepare.







Abstract
During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes have been developed into an important class of monomers with the resulting polymers being the subject of hundreds of publications. For unknown reasons, not a single example of a silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ruthenocenophane is described in the literature. We set out to address this mystery and could synthesize the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes. Their molecular structures as well as their heat release in the melt, render them as highly strained sandwich compounds that are polymerizable. Why did it take so long to prepare the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes? This question is addressed by a detailed analysis of the kinetics of the salt&#8208;metathesis approach, which reveals a striking difference between ferrocene and ruthenocene.

The aromatic (C&#8722;H) sulfenylation reaction with S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) can be Trp&#8208; or Tyr&#8208;selective under acidic conditions. The red chloride anion team kicks the Cys(Acm)(O) ball into the Trp goal, whereas the blue trimethylsilyl team kicks the ball into the Tyr goal. The proton scoreline in the stands supports both teams. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Otaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300799).

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogen Bonds with Different Binding Modes: The Acceptor &#8220;Rules&#8221; but the Donor &#8220;Chooses&#8221;</title>

Rules and regulations: This work studies the different hydrogen bond (HB) binding modes that can be established between neighbouring HB donors and acceptors in structures with relevance in catalysis and biology.







Abstract
This computational work studies the different hydrogen bond (HB) binding modes that can be established between neighbouring HB donors and acceptors in structures with relevance in catalysis and biology. To analyse the electronic effect on the &#963;&#8208;hole, unsubstituted HB donors and ones with two different substituents, an electron withdrawing (EWG), and an electron donating (EDG) group, were studied. Upon complexation, three different binding modes were observed: bifurcated, parallel, and zigzag. It was found that, as a general trend, HBs within a parallel pattern are the strongest followed by those within bifurcated and zigzag binding modes, leading to a &#8220;competition&#8221; between the last two. Similar patterns and trends have been found in experimental structures found in a search within the CSD. In conclusion, even though the HB acceptors &#8220;rule&#8221; the pattern and strength of the HB interactions within the dimers, when there is an option for different binding modes within a particular dimer, the HB donors &#8220;choose&#8221; the type of binding established.

Very radical: The recent advances of glycosyl radical&#8208;based C&#8208;glycosylation modification of amino acids and peptides are summarized, and perspectives for the further study of radical C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are presented.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;based reactions usually exhibit excellent functional&#8208;group compatibilities due to their mild initiation conditions. Glycosyl radical involved C&#8208;glycosylation modifications are important strategies to achieve highly regio&#8208; and chemoselective constructions of C&#8208;glycosidic bonds or C&#8208;glycoside linkages of peptides and proteins. In this Concept, we cover recent developments in glycosyl radical&#8208;based synthesis of unnatural amino acids and late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and proteins, and provide a preliminary outlook on the possible development of this direction in the future.

         <title>Preparation of Ropivacaine Encapsulated by Zeolite Imidazole Framework Microspheres as Sustained&#8208;Release System and Efficacy Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ropivacaine microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) as sustained&#8208;release system was prepared for the first time. This novel material exhibits a high drug loading rate and superior biological safety, with a continuously release in&#8197;vitro for at least 96&#8197;h, and the sensory block time was more than 72&#8197;h in&#8197;vivo pharmacodynamic.







Abstract
The management of persistent postoperative pain still remains a clinical challenge currently. Although ropivacaine (RVC) is widely used for postoperative analgesia as a local anesthetic, the short half&#8208;life makes it difficult to achieve the desired duration of analgesia. Herein, a RVC sustained&#8208;release microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework&#8208;8 (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) was synthesized for the first time, which prolonged the sustained&#8208;release of RVC and decreased the resulting drug toxicity. RVC can continuously release in&#8197;vitro for at least 96&#8197;h with high drug loading of 30.6&#8201;% and RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 had excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. In sciatic nerve block model, the sensory block time of RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 was significantly prolonged compared with RVC, achieving more than 72&#8197;h post injection and no inflammation or lesion were found. Based on high drug loading, ideal sustained&#8208;release and superior biological safety, RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 will be a novel delivery material for local anesthetic with potential application.

         <title>Conversion of Ketones into Blue&#8208;Emitting Electron&#8208;Deficient Benzofurans</title>

Aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones act as double O,C&#8208;nucleophiles in reaction with perfluorobenzene leading to strongly blue&#8208;emissive tetrafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;arylbenzofurans.







Abstract
A novel heavy metal&#8208;free and safe synthetic methodology enabling one&#8208;step conversion of ketones into corresponding 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluorobenzofurans (F4BFs) has been developed. The presented approach has numerous advantageous qualities, including utilization of readily available substrates, broad scope, scalability, and good reaction yields. Importantly, some of the benzofurans prepared by this method were heretofore inaccessible by any other known transformation. Importantly, furo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines and heretofore unexplored difuro[2,3&#8208;c:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;e]pyridazine can be prepared using this strategy. Spectroscopic studies reveal that for simple systems, absorption and fluorescence maxima fall within the UV spectral range, while &#960;&#8208;electron system expansion red&#8208;shifts both spectra. Moreover, the good fluorescence quantum yields observed in solution, up to 96&#8201;%, are also maintained in the solid state. Experimental results are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The presented methodology, combined with the spectroscopic characteristics, suggest the possibility of using F4BFs in the optoelectronic industry (i.&#8201;e., organic light emitting devices (OLED), organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET), organic photovoltaics (OPV)) as inexpensive and readily available emissive or semiconductor materials.

A novel example of circularly polarized rhenium(I) phosphor bearing chiral helicene&#8208;NHC ligand is presented and the comparative study with its helicenic Re(I) congeners highlighted the modulation of the emissive properties by the change in the complex design.







Abstract
The photophysical and chiroptical properties of a novel, chiral helicene&#8208;NHC&#8722;Re(I) complex bearing an N&#8208;(aza[6]helicenyl)&#8208;benzimidazolylidene ligand are described, showing its ability to emit yellow circularly polarized luminescence. A comparative analysis of this new system with other helicene&#8208;Re(I) complexes reported to date illustrates the impact of structural modifications on the emissive and absorptive properties.

         <dc:description>
A strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate and conductive layer was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability and good mechanical integrity. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3 sensor had high sensitivity, short response time, and long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healable and stretchable elastomeric material is essential for the development of flexible electronics devices to ensure their stable performance. In this study, a strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate (PIH2T1&#8208;tri, containing multiple reversible repairing sites such as disulfide, imine, and hydrogen bonds) and conductive layer (carbon nanotube, CNT) was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency=91&#8201;%). It exhibited good mechanical integrity in terms of elongation at break (672&#8201;%), tensile strength (1.41&#8197;MPa). The Young's modulus (0.39&#8197;MPa) was close to that of human skin. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3 sensor also demonstrated an effective self&#8208;healing function for electrical conduction and sensing property. Meanwhile, it had high sensitivity (gauge factor (GF)=24.1), short response time (120&#8197;ms), and long&#8208;term durability (4000&#8197;cycles). This study offers a novel self&#8208;healable elastomer platform with carbon based conductive components to develop flexible strain sensors towards high performance soft electronics.

         <title>Anion Modulated Expression of Chirality in Hydrogen Bond Templated Mechanically Chiral [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion recognition promotes the shuttling of the macrocyclic ring in mechanically chiral [2]rotaxanes. The position of the macrocycle is reported by changes in the diastereotopic behaviour in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. The macrocycle can be returned to its initial station upon removal of the anion.







Abstract
The syntheses of two novel mechanically chiral rotaxanes containing urea and squaramide motifs (in yields of 33&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively) are presented. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic titrations reveal shuttling of the macrocycle &#8211; detectable by modulation of the expression of mechanical chirality in the NMR spectrum &#8211; is possible through the addition of achiral chloride anions, a process which is reversed by the addition of sodium cations.

         <title>Regulating Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of the Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total chemical synthesis of antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) derivatives including partially sugar deleted forms and unnatural forms incorporating glucose&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose&#8208;type sugars of the natural form is described. These elaborated AFGPs indicate a unique function of the sugar residues that form a unique dynamic water phase, thereby inhibiting freezing.







Abstract
Antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP), which inhibits the freezing of water, is highly O&#8208;glycosylated with a disaccharide, d&#8208;Gal&#946;1&#8208;3&#8208;d&#8208;GalNAc&#945; (GalGalNAc). To elucidate the function of the sugar residues for antifreeze activity at the molecular level, we conducted a total chemical synthesis of partially sugar deleted AFGP derivatives, and unnatural forms of AFGPs incorporating glucose (Glc)&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose (Gal)&#8208;type sugars. These elaborated AFGP derivatives demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each sugar residue on AFGPs precisely correlates with the antifreeze activity. A hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange experiment using synthetic AFGPs revealed a different dynamic behavior of water around sugar residues depending on the sugar structures. These results indicate that sugar residues on AFGP form a unique dynamic water phase that disturbs the absorbance of water molecules onto the ice surface, thereby inhibiting freezing.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Ligands for Histological Multiplex Spectral Detection of Distinct Protein Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple colors. A palette of fluorescent donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor thiophene&#8208;based ligands with distinct photo&#8208;physical properties was synthesized. Ligands with specific chemical composition displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology and by applying different combination of ligands, multiplex spectral detection of distinct protein aggregates could be afforded. We foresee that these ligands will aid in fluorescent assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
The aggregation and accumulation of proteins in the brain is the defining feature of many devastating neurodegenerative diseases. The development of fluorescent ligands that bind to these accumulations, or deposits, is essential for the characterization of these neuropathological lesions. We report the synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) thiophene&#8208;based ligands with different emission properties. The D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands displayed selectivity towards distinct disease&#8208;associated protein deposits in histological sections from postmortem brain tissue of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability of the ligands to selectively identify AD&#8208;associated pathological alterations, such as deposits composed of aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau, was reduced when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. When combining the D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands with conventional thiophene&#8208;based ligands, superior spectral separation of distinct protein aggregates in AD tissue sections was obtained. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species, as well as offer novel strategies for developing multiplex fluorescence detection of protein aggregates in tissue sections.

The D-A-D ligands displayed selectivity towards distinct disease-associated protein deposits in histological sections from postmortem brain tissue of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability of the ligands to selectively identify AD-associated pathological alterations, such as deposits composed of aggregates of the amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau, was reduced when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. When combining the D-A-D ligands with conventional thiophene-based ligands, superior spectral separation of distinct protein aggregates in AD tissue sections was obtained. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species, as well as offer novel strategies for developing multiplex fluorescence detection of protein aggregates in tissue sections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photophysical Characterization of Isoguanine in a Prebiotic&#8208;Like Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations reveal the photophysical feasibility of isoguanine as a nucleobase precursor under prebiotic conditions. Protonated isoguanine decays to the ground state in sub&#8208;ps time scales, consistently with the barrierless potential energy profiles connecting the Franck&#8208;Condon region with internal conversion funnels.







Abstract
It is intriguing how a mixture of organic molecules survived the prebiotic UV fluxes and evolved into the actual genetic building blocks. Scientists are trying to shed light on this issue by synthesizing nucleic acid monomers and their analogues under prebiotic Era&#8208;like conditions and by exploring their excited state dynamics. To further add to this important body of knowledge, this study discloses new insights into the photophysical properties of protonated isoguanine, an isomorph of guanine, using steady&#8208;state and femtosecond broadband transient absorption spectroscopies, and quantum mechanical calculations. Protonated isoguanine decays in ultrafast time scales following 292&#8197;nm excitation, consistently with the barrierless paths connecting the bright S1 (&#960;&#960;*) state with different internal conversion funnels. Complementary calculations for neutral isoguanine predict similar photophysical properties. These results demonstrate that protonated isoguanine can be considered photostable in contrast to protonated guanine, which exhibits 40&#8208;fold longer excited state lifetimes.

         <title>Widening the Landscape of Small Molecule Activation with Gold&#8208;Aluminyl Complexes: A Systematic Study of E&#8722;H (E=O, N) Bonds, SO2 and N2O Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional properties of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes are predicted to lead to thermodynamically and kinetically feasible activation of E&#8722;H (E=N, O) bonds of ammonia and water, as well as SO2 capture and N2O reduction (all reactions are exergonic with barriers lower than 15&#8197;kcal/mol at 298&#8197;K). The N2O reduction is also predicted to lead to feasible catalytic redox cycles using N2O as an O&#8208;atom source and, unprecedently, the gold&#8208;aluminyl complex as a catalyst.







Abstract
The electronic features of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes have been thoroughly explored. Their similarity with Group&#8197;14 dimetallenes and other metal&#8208;aluminyl complexes suggests that their reactivity with small molecules beyond carbon dioxide could be accessed. In this work, the reactivity of the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6 diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;ditert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) complex towards water, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide is computationally explored. The reaction mechanisms computed for each substrate strongly suggest that all activation processes are in principle experimentally feasible. Electronic structure analysis highlights that, in all cases, the reactivity is driven by the presence of the poorly polarized electron&#8208;sharing gold&#8208;aluminyl bond, which induces a radical&#8208;like reactivity of the complex towards all the substrates. A flat topology of the potential energy surface (PES) has been found for the reaction with N2O, where two almost isoenergetic transition states can be located along the same reaction coordinate with different geometries, suggesting that the N2O binding mode may not be a good indicator of the nature of N2O activation in a cooperative bimetallic reactivity. In addition, the catalytic potentialities of these complexes have been explored in the framework of nitrous oxide reduction. The study reveals that the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex might be an efficient catalyst towards oxidation of phosphines (and boranes) via N2O reduction. These findings underline recurring trends in the novel chemistry of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes and call for experimental feedbacks.

         <title>Syntheses and Biofilm Reducing Effects of l&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Derived Analogues of the Fungal Macrocidins A and Z</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variations on ring size and polarity: Four hydroxy analogues of the fungal metabolites macrocidin A and Z were synthesised from fully and orthogonally protected l&#8208;dopa derivatives. They showed lesser growth inhibitory and dispersive effects on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms than the l&#8208;tyrosine derived natural leads or the new synthetic (S,S,S)&#8208;normacrocidin A. The more lipophilic hydroxymacrocidin Z analogues were generally more active than the polar hydroxymacrocidin A analogues, regardless of their para&#8208; or metacyclophane connectivity.







Abstract
Four analogues of the fungal metabolites macrocidin A and Z, featuring [13]para&#8208; or [13]metacyclophanes, were synthesised from fully and orthogonally protected l&#8208;dopa instead of l&#8208;tyrosine. They were tested for antibiotic activities and for effects on the growth and persistence of microbial biofilms. Tentative structure&#8208;activity relationships and distinct differences when compared with the natural lead compounds were identified.

         <title>Exciplex&#8208;Forming Cohost Systems with 2,3&#8208;Dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based Acceptors to Achieve Efficient Near Infrared OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A yellow&#8208;orange emission exciplex&#8208;forming blend composed of a 2,3 dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based acceptor and a carbazole&#8208;based donor is employed as a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) cohost system for a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;configured organic near&#8208;infrared emitter to achieve an organic light&#8208;emitting device with electroluminescence centered at 743&#8197;nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.79&#8201;% by virtue of the effective energy transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Two new 2,3&#8208;dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based acceptors (A) p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN were synthesized to blend with a donor (D) CPTBF for the exciplex formation. The energy levels of p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN are modulated by the peripheral substituents 4&#8208; and 3&#8208;benzonitrile, respectively. Exciplex&#8208;forming blends were identified by the observation of the red&#8208;shifted emissions from various D&#8201;:&#8201;A blends with higher ratios of donor for suppressing the aggregation of acceptor. The two&#8208;component relaxation processes observed by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence support the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) character of the exciplex&#8208;forming blends. The device employing CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;p&#8208;QCN and (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) blend as the emitting layer (EML) gave EQEmax of 1.76&#8201;% and 5.12&#8201;%, and electroluminescence (EL) &#955;max of 629&#8197;nm and 618&#8197;nm, respectively. The device efficiency can be further improved to 4.32&#8201;% and 5.57&#8201;% with CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;p&#8208;QCN and (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) as the EML, which is consistent with their improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). A new fluorescent emitter BPBBT with photoluminescence (PL) &#955;max of 726&#8197;nm and a high PLQY of 67&#8201;% was synthesized and utilized as the dopant of CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) cohost system. The device employing CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (4&#8201;:&#8201;1): 5&#8197;wt.% BPBBT as the EML gave an EQEmax of 5.02&#8201;% and EL &#955;max centered at 735&#8197;nm, however, the weak residual exciplex emission remains. By reducing the donor ratio, the exciplex emission can be completely transferred to BPBBT and the corresponding device with CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (2&#8201;:&#8201;1): 5&#8197;wt.% BPBBT as the EML can achieve EL &#955;max of 743&#8197;nm and EQEmax of 4.79&#8201;%. This work manifests the high efficiency near infrared (NIR) OLED can be realized by triplet excitons harvesting of exciplex&#8208;forming cohost system, followed by the effective energy transfer to an NIR fluorescent dopant.

&lt;p&gt;Two new 2,3-dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene-based acceptors (A) &lt;b&gt;p-QCN&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;m-QCN&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized to blend with a donor (D) CPTBF for the exciplex formation. The energy levels of &lt;b&gt;p-QCN&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;m-QCN&lt;/b&gt; are modulated by the peripheral substituents 4- and 3-benzonitrile, respectively. Exciplex-forming blends were identified by the observation of the red-shifted emissions from various D&#8201;:&#8201;A blends with higher ratios of donor for suppressing the aggregation of acceptor. The two-component relaxation processes observed by time-resolved photoluminescence support the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) character of the exciplex-forming blends. The device employing CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;p-QCN&lt;/b&gt; and (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;m-QCN&lt;/b&gt; (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) blend as the emitting layer (EML) gave EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.76&#8201;% and 5.12&#8201;%, and electroluminescence (EL) &#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 629&#8197;nm and 618&#8197;nm, respectively. The device efficiency can be further improved to 4.32&#8201;% and 5.57&#8201;% with CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;p-QCN&lt;/b&gt; and (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;m-QCN&lt;/b&gt; (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) as the EML, which is consistent with their improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). A new fluorescent emitter &lt;b&gt;BPBBT&lt;/b&gt; with photoluminescence (PL) &#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 726&#8197;nm and a high PLQY of 67&#8201;% was synthesized and utilized as the dopant of CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;m-QCN&lt;/b&gt; (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) cohost system. The device employing CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;m-QCN&lt;/b&gt; (4&#8201;:&#8201;1): 5&#8197;wt.% &lt;b&gt;BPBBT&lt;/b&gt; as the EML gave an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.02&#8201;% and EL &#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; centered at 735&#8197;nm, however, the weak residual exciplex emission remains. By reducing the donor ratio, the exciplex emission can be completely transferred to &lt;b&gt;BPBBT&lt;/b&gt; and the corresponding device with CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;m-QCN&lt;/b&gt; (2&#8201;:&#8201;1): 5&#8197;wt.% &lt;b&gt;BPBBT&lt;/b&gt; as the EML can achieve EL &#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 743&#8197;nm and EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 4.79&#8201;%. This work manifests the high efficiency near infrared (NIR) OLED can be realized by triplet excitons harvesting of exciplex-forming cohost system, followed by the effective energy transfer to an NIR fluorescent dopant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Geminal Al/P and Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs towards Heterocumulenes</title>

Frustrated pairs&#8217; different preferences: The geminal oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=CH(SiMe3)2) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 show different reactivities towards heterocumulenes (PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2, PhNSO) and sulfur dioxide. Whereas the P&#8722;O&#8722;Al FLP forms stable adducts with all substrates except for SO2, the P&#8722;O&#8722;Si FLP does not form adducts with sulfur bound to silicon.







Abstract
The two oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=CH(SiMe3)2; 1) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (2) were reacted with the heterocumulenes PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2 and PhNSO as well as SO2. With isocyanate and cyanate, both 1 and 2, form addition products under formation of five&#8208;membered rings. With CS2, isothiocyanate and sulfinylaniline, only 1 forms stable adducts, whereas 2 shows reactivity towards sulfinylaniline, but the product decomposed after a few minutes. The reaction of 1 with SO2 led to partial cleavage of the P&#8722;O&#8722;Al and Al&#8722;C units, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of 2 with SO2 affords the 1,2&#8208;addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and CHN analyses.

For both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production: A unique bio&#8208;inspired hydrogen production catalyst design with the rational incorporation of a proton&#8208;relaying drug molecule around a synthetic metal cobalt core.







Abstract
The development of potent H2 production catalysts is a key aspect in our journey toward the establishment of a sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral power infrastructure. Hydrogenase enzymes provide the blueprint for designing efficient catalysts by the rational combination of central metal core and protein scaffold&#8208;based outer coordination sphere (OCS). Traditionally, a biomimetic catalyst is crafted by including natural amino acids as OCS features around a synthetic metal motif to functionally imitate the metalloenzyme activity. Here, we have pursued an unconventional approach and implanted two distinct drug molecules (isoniazid and nicotine hydrazide) at the axial position of a cobalt core to create a new genre of synthetic catalysts. The resultant cobalt complexes are active for both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production in near&#8208;neutral water, where they significantly enhance the catalytic performance of the unfunctionalized parent cobalt complex. The drug molecules showcased a dual effect as they influence the catalytic HER by improving the surrounding proton relay along and exerting subtle electronic effects. The isoniazid&#8208;ligated catalyst C1 outperformed the nicotine hydrazide&#8208;bound complex C2, as it produced H2 from water (pH&#8197;6.0) at a rate of 3960&#8197;s&#8722;1 while exhibiting Faradaic efficiency of about 90&#8201;%. This strategy opens up newer avenues of bio&#8208;inspired catalyst design beyond amino acid&#8208;based OCS features.

Abstract
Controlling aspects of the &#956;2&#8208;X&#8722; bridging anion in the metal&#8211;organic framework Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 [GaX(bdc)] (X&#8722;=(OH)&#8722; or F&#8722;, bdc=1, 4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) is shown to direct the temperature at which thermally induced breathing transitions of this framework occur. In situ single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that substituting 20&#8201;% of (OH)&#8722; in [Ga(OH)(bdc)] (1) for F&#8722; to produce [Ga(OH)0.8F0.2(bdc)] (2) stabilises the large pore (lp) form relative to the narrow pore (np) form, causing a well&#8208;defined decrease in the onset of the lp to np transition at higher temperatures, and the adsorption/desorption of nitrogen at lower temperatures through np to lp to intermediate (int) pore transitions. These in&#8197;situ diffraction studies have also yielded a more plausible crystal structure of the int&#8208;[GaX(bdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O phases and shown that increasing the heating rate to a flash heating regime can enable the int&#8208;[GaX(bdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O to lp&#8208;[GaX(bdc)] transition to occur at a lower temperature than np&#8208;[GaX(bdc)] via an unreported pathway.

         <title>Quest for a Rational Molecular Design of Alkyl&#8208;Distyrylbenzene Liquid by Substitution Pattern Modulation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via modulation of the substitution pattern, 2&#8208;decyltetradecyl chains at the 2,5&#8208;substituted position was found to be the desired substitution pattern for alkyl&#8208;distyrylbenzene liquids exhibiting the lowest viscosity as a practically stable liquid at room temperature, intrinsic optical properties, as well as high thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stabilities. The guiding strategy will be useful for constructing superior alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with rich optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Alkyl&#8208;&#960; functional molecular liquids (FMLs) are of interest for fabricating soft electronic devices due to their fluidic nature and innate optoelectronic functions from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety. However, predictable development of alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the desired liquid and optoelectronic properties is challenging. A series of alkyl&#8208;distyrylbenzene (DSB) liquids was studied in terms of the substituent position effect by attaching 2&#8208;octyldodecyl chains at (2,4&#8208;), (2,5&#8208;), (2,6&#8208;), and (3,5&#8208;). The effect of the alkyl chain length was investigated by attaching 2&#8208;hexyldecyl, 2&#8208;decyltetradecyl (C10C14), and 2&#8208;dodecylhexadecyl at the (2,5&#8208;) substituent position. The 2,5&#8208;C10C14 substituent pattern constructed a superior alkyl&#8208;DSB liquid with a lower viscosity, intrinsic optical properties, and high thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stabilities. The discovered 2,5&#8208;C10C14 was applied to dicyanostyrylbenzene and comparable liquid physical and optical superiorities were confirmed. This molecular design is useful for creating alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the aforementioned advantages, which are applicable for deformable and flowable optoelectronic devices.

         <title>AAZTA&#8208;Like Ligands Bearing Phenolate Arms as Efficient Chelators for 68Ga Labelling in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
AAZTA&#8208; and DATA&#8208;like ligands bearing one phenolate pendant arm form Ga(III) complexes with significant thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. 68Ga labelling was efficient both at room temperature and at 95&#8201;&#176;C and an &#945;v&#946;3 integrin targeting probe was synthesized, labelled, and tested in&#8197;vivo on B16&#8208;F10 tumours.







Abstract
The introduction of a phenolate pendant arm in place of an acetate on AAZTA&#8208; and DATA&#8208;like ligands resulted in hepta&#8208; and hexadentate chelators able to form Ga(III) complexes with thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness higher than that of other Ga(III) complexes based on the parent 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine scaffold. In particular, the heptadentate AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB with a phenolate arm on an endocyclic N&#8208;atom shows a logKGaL of 27.35 and a remarkable resistance to hydroxide coordination up to basic pH (pH&gt;9). This behaviour allows to also improve the kinetic inertness of the complex showing a dissociation half&#8208;life (t1/2) at pH&#8197;7.4 of 76&#8197;h. Although also the hexadentate AAZ2A&#8208;exoHB chelator forms a stable (logKGaL=24.69) and inert (t1/2=33&#8197;h at pH&#8197;7.4) Ga(III) complex, the 68Ga labelling showed a better radiochemical yield with AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB, especially at room temperature. Thus, a bifunctional chelator of AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB was synthesized bearing an isothiocyanate group that was conjugated to the N&#8208;terminus of a c(RGD) peptide for integrin receptor targeting. Finally, the conjugate was successfully labelled with 68Ga isotope, and the resulting radiotracer tested for its stability in human serum and then in&#8197;vivo for targeting B16&#8208;F10 tumours with miniPET imaging.

         <title>Selective Chelation of the Exotic Meitner&#8208;Auger Emitter Mercury&#8208;197&#8201;m/g with Sulfur&#8208;Rich Macrocyclic Ligands: Towards the Future of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sulfur&#8208;rich macrocyclic chelators were synthesized; their ability to bind Hg2+ was studied. The validity of these chelators for 197m/gHg2+ radiopharmaceutical incorporation was investigated through radiolabeling studies and in&#8197;vitro stability assays. The importance of sulfur coordinating atoms was rationalized, thus helping to design 197m/gHg2+ chelators for nuclear medicine applications.







Abstract
Mercury&#8208;197&#8197;m/g are a promising pair of radioactive isomers for incorporation into a theranostic as they can be used as a diagnostic agent using SPECT imaging and a therapeutic via Meitner&#8208;Auger electron emissions. However, the current absence of ligands able to stably coordinate 197m/gHg to a tumour&#8208;targeting vector precludes their use in&#8197;vivo. To address this, we report herein a series of sulfur&#8208;rich chelators capable of incorporating 197m/gHg into a radiopharmaceutical. 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecane (NS4) and its derivatives, (2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetic acid (NS4&#8208;CA) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetamide (NS4&#8208;BA), were designed, synthesized and analyzed for their ability to coordinate Hg2+ through a combination of theoretical (DFT) and experimental coordination chemistry studies (NMR and mass spectrometry) as well as 197m/gHg radiolabeling studies and in&#8197;vitro stability assays. The development of stable ligands for 197m/gHg reported herein is extremely impactful as it would enable their use for in&#8197;vivo imaging and therapy, leading to personalized treatments for cancer.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Bis&#8208;pentafluoroarylated Anthracene Derivatives for N&#8208;type Organic&#8208;Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of two pentafluorophenyl groups into anthracene through direct C&#8722;H arylation is demonstrated. This facile method enabled the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions in a single step. Among them, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (2,6&#8208;DPA&#8722;F) serves as an n&#8208;type semiconductor in OFETs, exhibiting an electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm2/V.







Abstract
Diphenylanthracene (DPA) and its derivatives are promising semiconducting materials for p&#8208;type organic&#8208;field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, to develop n&#8208;type semiconducting materials with an anthracene core, pentafluorobenzene was introduced into anthracene by C&#8722;H direct arylation, enabling the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (DPA&#8722;F) derivatives. The high reactivity of the pentafluorobenzene C&#8722;H bond allows direct arylation for synthesizing DPA&#8722;F derivatives in a single step. The introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups provides the anthracene derivatives with n&#8208;type semiconducting properties, in contrast to the p&#8208;type properties of the parent DPAs. Among the synthesized compounds, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene shows a high electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm2/Vs and an on/off ratio&gt;106 in OFETs. The high crystallinity results in the smooth electron transport.

     alt="Facile Synthesis of Bis-pentafluoroarylated Anthracene Derivatives for N-type Organic-Field-Effect Transistor Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The introduction of two pentafluorophenyl groups&lt;/b&gt; into anthracene through direct C&#8722;H arylation is demonstrated. This facile method enabled the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions in a single step. Among them, 2,6-bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (2,6-DPA&#8722;F) serves as an n-type semiconductor in OFETs, exhibiting an electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diphenylanthracene (DPA) and its derivatives are promising semiconducting materials for p-type organic-field-effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, to develop n-type semiconducting materials with an anthracene core, pentafluorobenzene was introduced into anthracene by C&#8722;H direct arylation, enabling the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (DPA&#8722;F) derivatives. The high reactivity of the pentafluorobenzene C&#8722;H bond allows direct arylation for synthesizing DPA&#8722;F derivatives in a single step. The introduction of strong electron-withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups provides the anthracene derivatives with n-type semiconducting properties, in contrast to the p-type properties of the parent DPAs. Among the synthesized compounds, 2,6-bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene shows a high electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs and an on/off ratio&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; in OFETs. The high crystallinity results in the smooth electron transport. This study provides a facile synthetic method for n-type semiconducting materials and insights into the molecular design of the positional effects of aromatic substituents on anthracene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Masked Terminal Nickel&#8208;Oxide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel(II) complex reacted with peroxyphenylacetic acid to yield a nickel(III)&#8211;(hydr)oxide adduct (stabilized through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction to an acetate co&#8208;ligand) that displayed all the reactivity properties of a terminal nickel&#8208;oxide oxidant.







Abstract
In exploring terminal nickel&#8208;oxo complexes, postulated to be the active oxidant in natural and non&#8208;natural oxidation reactions, we report the synthesis of the pseudo&#8208;trigonal bipyramidal NiII complexes (K)[NiII(LPh)(DMF)] (1[DMF]) and (NMe4)2[NiII(LPh)(OAc)] (1[OAc]) (LPh=2,2&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tris&#8208;(N&#8208;phenylacetamide); DMF=N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; &#8722;OAc=acetate). Both complexes were characterized using NMR, FTIR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing the LPh ligand to bind in a tetradentate fashion, together with an ancillary donor. The reaction of 1[OAc] with peroxyphenyl acetic acid (PPAA) resulted in the formation of [(LPh)NiIII&#8722;O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OAc]2&#8722;, 2, that displays many of the characteristics of a terminal Ni=O species. 2 was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis, EPR, and XAS spectroscopies and ESI&#8208;MS. 2 decayed to yield a NiII&#8208;phenolate complex 3 (through aromatic electrophilic substitution) that was characterized by NMR, FTIR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. 2 was capable of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and epoxidation of olefins, as well as oxygen atom transfer oxidation of phosphines at exceptional rates. While the oxo&#8208;wall remains standing, this complex represents an excellent example of a masked metal&#8208;oxide that displays all of the properties expected of the ever elusive terminal M=O beyond the oxo&#8208;wall.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Diterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus and Its Sponge&#8208;Prey Chelonaplysilla sp.</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical ecology: Investigation of the nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded twelve diterpenoids, including nine new diterpenoids of the 5,19&#8208;cycloclerodane&#8208;, clerodane&#8208; and subersin&#8208; type. Interestingly, six of them were also found in the sponge Chelonaplysilla sp. from the same water region. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these diterpenoids, and the chemo&#8208;ecological implications of their co&#8208;occurrence in the two organisms, were discussed.







Abstract
Investigation of the South China Sea nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded, in addition to three known compounds, nine new diterpenoids of the 5,19&#8208;cycloclerodane&#8208; (sanyanolides A&#8211;D), clerodane&#8208; (sanyanolide E) and subersin&#8208; (sanyanolides F&#8211;I) type. Remarkably, six diterpenoids aforementioned from H.&#8197;sanguineus were also isolated from the sponge Chelonaplysilla sp. from the same water region, suggesting a trophic relationship between H.&#8197;sanguineus and Chelonaplysilla sp. The structure and absolute configuration of new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and/or time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these diterpenoids, along with the chemo&#8208;ecological implications of their co&#8208;occurrence in the two organisms investigated, was proposed and discussed. In in&#8197;vitro bioassays, echinoclerodane A exhibited a potent inhibitory effect (IC50=2.81&#8197;&#956;M) on LPS&#8208;induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. In addition, echinoclerodane A and oculatolide showed considerable antibacterial activities with MIC values ranging from 1.0 to 8.0&#8197;&#956;g/mL.

Boost the capability of photocatalysts: We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid (TPA) ligand and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.&#8201;g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods) synthesized by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.&#8201;e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as the precursor.







Abstract
It has been rarely reported the morphological control of derivatives of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in hydrothermal conditions for photocatalytic applications. We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid/terephthalate (TPA) ligand and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.&#8201;g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods). The composites are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.&#8201;e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as precursor. The formation mechanism of composite materials with different morphological features is discussed. Impressively, the composite of TiO2 nanoparticles/TPA synthesized using H2O as solvent under hydrothermal condition exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 activity among the studied materials, with a photocatalytic H2 production rate of 6.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is approximately 7.5&#8208;fold higher than pure TiO2 (Degussa, P25) and prominent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 65&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the mechanism of boosted photocatalytic H2 production is discussed.

         <title>Hexaphenyltriphenylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages: Host&#8211;Guest Complexation for White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hexaphenyltriphenylene(HPT)&#8208;based metallacages showing intense blue emission both in the solution and solid state were prepared via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly. They can serve as hosts to complex with three planar fluorescent dyes, and bright white light can be generated when they complex with PDI derivatives.







Abstract
A hexaphenyltriphenylene&#8208;based hexatopic pyridyl ligand is designed and used to prepare three hexagonal prismatic metallacages via metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the planar conjugated structures of the hexaphenyltriphenylene skeleton, such metallacages show good host&#8211;guest complexation with a series of emissive dyes, which have been further used to tune their emission in solution. Interestingly, based on their complementary emission colors, white light emission is achieved in a mixture of the host metallacages and the guests.

         <title>The Mechanochemical Fries Rearrangement: Manipulating Isomer Ratios in the Synthesis of p&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenone at Different Scales
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
para&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenone is prepared by the first mechanochemical Fries rearrangement. The reaction was optimized in the ball mill and then transferred to a continuous process in a twin&#8208;screw extruder. The isomer ratio can be influenced by reaction parameters such as LAG or temperature.







Abstract
Herein, the first mechanochemical Fries rearrangement for the industrially important synthesis of para&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone, inside a ball mill and a twin&#8208;screw extruder, is presented. Our approach leads to a yield of 62&#8201;% in as little as 90&#8197;minutes while liquid&#8208;assisted grinding can shift the isomer ratio resulting in an excess of the desired para&#8208;product. The multigram scale&#8208;up by extrusion leads to 61&#8201;% yield in only three minutes while completely avoiding solvents. The extrusion temperature can even further be reduced by combining extrusion with a subsequent ageing step.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold To Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereo&#8208;divergent packing of helical scaffolds based on pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide is observed in two different solid forms obtained from solvents of different polarity. Efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction is observed in the yellow form, which has a homochiral molecular arrangement with closer intermolecular proximity, and spatial alignment of polar residues.







Abstract
This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule gramicidin&#8197;A. The scaffold, 1, derived from a pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units in 1 are oriented outwards. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like gramicidin&#8197;A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion, while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited an almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 95&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098&#8197;eV, thus indicating a Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules in achieving efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction.

         <dc:description>
The sugar moiety of the antifreeze glycoprotein AFGP can form a unique dynamic water phase that includes disordered water molecules thereby inhibiting the freezing process. The property of this water phase seems to depend on both the structure and the number of sugar moieties. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Okamoto, Y. Kajihara, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203553).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 21, April 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired helical scaffold with high proton conductivity in the solid state is reported.

         <dc:description>
Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are the final integrators of a complex molecular feedback mechanism that interfaces with the genome, consolidating information for transcriptional regulation. TFs consist of both structured DNA&#8208;binding domains and long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) embedded with motifs linked to transcriptional control. These IDRs endow transcription factors with structural plasticity which is central to their functions in the nucleus. More information can be found in the Review article by P. O. Heidarsson and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203369)

The chemical features of intrinsically disordered regions in transcription factors that endow them with structural plasticity central to their functions in the nucleus are dissected in this Review. It highlights recent studies that illustrate the involvement of disordered regions in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation.







Abstract
Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are the final integrators of a complex molecular feedback mechanism that interfaces with the genome, consolidating information for transcriptional regulation. TFs consist of both structured DNA&#8208;binding domains and long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) embedded with motifs linked to transcriptional control. It is now well established that the dynamic multifunctionality of IDRs is the basis for a wide spectrum of TF functions necessary to navigate and regulate the human genome. This review dissects the chemical features of TF IDRs that endow them with structural plasticity that is central to their functions in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of a set of over 1600 human TFs through AlphaFold was used to identify key features of their IDRs. Recent studies were then highlighted to illustrate IDR involvement in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation. To expand our understanding of TF functions, future directions are suggested for integrating experiments and simulations, from in vitro to living systems.

Recent efforts to use metallosupramolecular structures to mimic biologically inspired functions including molecular recognition and catalysis are described.







Abstract
Natural machinery such as proteins and enzymes can bind substrates and perform intricate functions on these molecules. This behaviour is mediated by highly ordered but conformationally flexible structures dictated through favourable intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions. Metallosupramolecular architectures (MSAs) function as synthetic machinery that are responsive to their environment, and display similar, but less impressive, abilities to their biological counterparts. Natural and synthetic systems share the properties of molecular recognition and catalysis facilitated through the often complex structures of these architectures. This article outlines efforts to use metallosupramolecular structures to mimic the properties of biological enzymes and machines using important recent examples from the field.

         <title>Intermolecular Triazene Alkene Cycloaddition via Lewis Base Catalysis: Access to Diverse Trifluoromethylated Pyrazolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF3&#8208;subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF3CHN2.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Observation for Dynamic Oscillation during the Self&#8208;Assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic oscillation implicated in structural heterogeneity during the self&#8208;assembly of amyloid peptide 1&#8208;42 (A&#946;42) may play a crucial role in eliciting cellular responses. We developed a real&#8208;time monitoring platform to observe an oscillatory non&#8208;equilibrium interaction that dominated the A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells during interplay with an oscillator (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Molecular dynamics studies indicated that the electrostatic and hydrophobic segments of LPS involved in the temporary heteromolecular association and slightly decelerated the intrinsic thermally&#8208;induced protein dynamics of A&#946;42. A bait&#8208;specific intervention strategy could temporarily slow down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42 to extend the lifetime of autonomous oscillation and augment the A&#946;42 clearance of neuronal cells. The lifetime increment of dynamic oscillation shows a bait concentration&#8208;dependent manner to reflect the non&#8208;equilibrium binding strength. This relationship may serve as a drug&#8208;screening predictor for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>The interplay between different stimuli in a 4D printed photo&#8208;, thermal&#8208;, and water&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomer actuator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;stimuli responsivity in 3D&#8208;printed objects is receiving much attention. However, the simultaneous interplay between different environmental stimuli is largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate direct ink writing of an oligomeric ink containing an azobenzene photo&#8208;switch with an accessible hydrogen bond allowing triple responsivity to light, heat, and water. The resulting printed liquid crystal elastomer performs multiple actuations, the response depending on the environmental conditions. Films printed on a static substrate forming bilayers can rapidly change shape, bending almost 80 degrees if irradiated in air or undergoing a shrinkage of about 50% of its length when heated. The bilayer film assumes dramatically different shapes in water depending on combined environmental temperature and lighting conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Visualized Mechano&#8208;response Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly System for Small Molecule Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechano&#8208;response release of small molecules has received extensive attention in ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled drug release in recent years because it can achieve non&#8208;invasive, spatiotemporally controlled precise drug release. However, the vast majority of small molecules mechano&#8208;release reported so far are almost based on polymer systems, which suffer from complex preparations and single mechano&#8208;response. Here, an isoguanosine (isoG) visualized mechano&#8208;response supramolecular self&#8208;assembly (isoG&#8208;VMRSS) system was successfully constructed by a one&#8208;pot reaction. It is completely composed of small molecules, which allows for multiple mechano&#8208;response releases of isoG (at least 9 times) and ultimately has potential for application in US drug release. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach reveals the supramolecular network structure (formed by the joint action of related metal coordination bonds, boronate ester bonds and hydrogen bonds mediated by isoG) gradually formed inside the system is the underlying internal mechanism. Therefore, it provides a new and effective idea of small molecule release in the field of mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric fluorescence assay for pyrophosphate based on sulfur nanodots decorated metal organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective and sensitive detection of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) are of great significance both for clinical applications and fundamental research. In this work, a ratiometric fluorescent probe was developed by decorating a porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (PCN&#8208;224) with sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots). The red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 was significantly promoted (more than 6&#8208;fold) by S&#8208;dots through inhibiting molecular motion of porphyrin ligand, which also provided active sites for the detection of Cu2+ and PPi. Cu2+ could selectively quench the red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 through coordination with porphyrin ligand, and the competition reaction between PPi and Cu2+ resulted in the decomposing of coordination and recovery of red&#8208;fluorescence. The blue&#8208;fluorescence from S&#8208;dots was deemed as effective reference, which provided a built&#8208;in correction in complex environments. Based on these photophysical properties, a ratiometric fluorescence assay was developed for the quantitative detection of Cu2+ and PPi, with a limit of detection of 0.11 and 2.66 &#956;M, respectively. The accuracy and practical applications of assays were also demonstrated by detection in tap water and human serum samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrostability and Carbon Dioxide Capture of Boroxine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by One&#8208;Pot Oligoamine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing two birds with one stone. The representative of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs, COF&#8208;1, is modified with an oligoamine by one&#8208;pot condensation. The modification with the oligoamine not only boosts the water stability of COF&#8208;1, but also significantly increases its CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2 selectivity, especially in low pressure region. These advantages make the oligoamine&#8208;modified COF&#8208;1 suitable for capturing CO2 from humid flue gas.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water at the electron&#8208;deficient boron sites and even slightly humid air could destroy the integrity of their porous frameworks within hours. Such instability is a major limitation to the practical applications of boron&#8208;based COFs. Herein we report a significant enhancement of hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;1 as representative) by modification with an oligoamine (tetraethylenepentamine, TEPA), which leads to survival of the modified COF in water and long&#8208;time stability under humid atmosphere. Meanwhile, the TEPA modification also results in a considerable increase in CO2 adsorption capacity up to 13&#8197;times and a dramatic improvement in CO2/N2 selectivity in low pressure region, which make the modified COF suitable for capturing CO2 from flue gas. This work provides a facile, efficient, and scalable method to greatly improve hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs and reshape them into high&#8208;performance CO2 adsorbents.

         <title>Determinative Effect of Axial Linearity on Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Performance in Dinuclear Dysprosium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of axial linearity in two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes could be managed by adjusting the diamine substituent on the salen ligand, which directly determines the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) performance. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that collinear/parallel anisotropic axes of two DyIII ions can enable zero&#8208;dc&#8208;field quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) effect.







Abstract
Two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes based on salen ligands, namely, [Dy(L1)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(thf)]2 (1; H2L1=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)phenylenediamine) and [Dy2(L2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2]2 (2; H2L2=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)ethylenediamine) are reported. These two complexes have two short Dy&#8722;O(PhO) bonds that exhibit angles of &#8764;90&#176; for 1 and &#8764;143&#176; for 2, leading to clear slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2 and not for 1. Compound 2 has a near&#8208;identical core to the recently reported compound [Dy2(L3)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] (3; H2L3=N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzyl)amine). The only substantial difference is the relative angle of the two O(PhO)&#8722;Dy&#8722;O(PhO) vectors, which is collinear in 2 owing to inversion symmetry and &#8764;68&#176; in 3 due to a molecular C2 axis. It is shown that this subtle structural difference leads to large differences in the dipolar ground states, giving rise to open magnetic hysteresis for 3 and not for 2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The manipulation of axial linearity&lt;/b&gt; in two dichloride-bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes could be managed by adjusting the diamine substituent on the salen ligand, which directly determines the single-molecule magnet (SMM) performance. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that collinear/parallel anisotropic axes of two Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions can enable zero-dc-field quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) effect.

         <title>CryoEM Structure with ATP Synthase Enables Late&#8208;Stage Diversification of Cruentaren&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pattern for a new design: The cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren&#8197;A bound to ATP synthase is reported; it facilitated the design of new inhibitors through semisynthetic modification. Cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives were developed, and a trans&#8208;alkene isomer was found to exhibit similar activity to cruentaren&#8197;A against three cancer cell lines as well as other analogues that still retained potent inhibitory activity.







Abstract
Cruentaren&#8197;A is a natural product that exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines, yet its binding site within ATP synthase remained unknown, thus limiting the development of improved analogues as anticancer agents. Herein, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren&#8197;A bound to ATP synthase, which allowed the design of new inhibitors through semisynthetic modification. Examples of cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives include a trans&#8208;alkene isomer, which was found to exhibit similar activity to cruentaren&#8197;A against three cancer cell lines as well as several other analogues that retained potent inhibitory activity. Together, these studies provide a foundation for the generation of cruentaren&#8197;A derivatives as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.

         <title>Lower Energy Excitation of Water Soluble Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Mixed&#8208;Ligand Metallacrowns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The best of both worlds: Water solubility of Zn16Ln(pyzHA)16 (H2pyzHA: pyrazine hydroxamic acid) or lower energy excitation of Zn16Ln(quinoHA)16 (H2quinoHA: quinoxaline hydroxamic acid) metallacrowns (MCs)? No need to choose! In water soluble mixed&#8208;ligand Zn16Yb(pyzHA)x(quinoHA)16&#8211;x MCs characteristic emission of YbIII in the near&#8208;infrared range can be sensitized upon excitation up to 600&#8197;nm in the solid state or 500&#8197;nm in aqueous solution.







Abstract
By combining advantages of two series of lanthanide(III)/zinc(II) metallacrowns (MCs) assembled using pyrazine&#8208; (pyzHA2&#8722;) and quinoxaline&#8208; (quinoHA2&#8722;) hydroximate building blocks ligands, we created here water&#8208;soluble mixed&#8208;ligand MCs with extended absorption to the visible range. The YbIII analogue demonstrated improved photophysical properties in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range in cell culture media, facilitating its application for NIR optical imaging in living HeLa cells.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Bioorthogonal Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;frontier molecular orbital interaction&#8208;controlled reactivity: The reactivity of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines in inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions is often described by using frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory. We show that FMO interactions play a minuscule role in the reactivity difference between commonly used scaffolds. Instead, Pauli repulsion is often the deciding factor.







Abstract
1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines are increasingly used as reactants in bioorthogonal chemistry due to their high reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with various dienophiles. Substituents in the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;positions of the tetrazine scaffold are known to have a significant impact on the rate of cycloadditions; this is commonly explained on the basis of frontier molecular orbital theory. In contrast, we show that reactivity differences between commonly used classes of tetrazines are not controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that mono&#8208;substituted tetrazines show high reactivity due to decreased Pauli repulsion, which leads to a more asynchronous approach associated with reduced distortion energy. This follows the recent Vermeeren&#8211;Hamlin&#8211;Bickelhaupt model of reactivity increase in asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. In addition, we reveal that ethylene is not a good model compound for other alkenes in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.

&lt;p&gt;1,2,4,5-Tetrazines are increasingly used as reactants in bioorthogonal chemistry due to their high reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with various dienophiles. Substituents in the 3- and 6-positions of the tetrazine scaffold are known to have a significant impact on the rate of cycloadditions; this is commonly explained on the basis of frontier molecular orbital theory. In contrast, we show that reactivity differences between commonly used classes of tetrazines are not controlled by frontier molecular orbital interactions. In particular, we demonstrate that mono-substituted tetrazines show high reactivity due to decreased Pauli repulsion, which leads to a more asynchronous approach associated with reduced distortion energy.

         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot protocol involving the in&#8197;situ generation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the nucleophilic substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromoketones with amines and the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketone intermediates was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of a diverse array of chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent results.







Abstract
A straightforward synthesis approach to chiral 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;aminoethanols via the one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation catalyzed by Ir catalyst was developed. This tandem process involves the in&#8197;situ generation of &#945;&#8208;amino ketones via the nucleophilic substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromoketones with amines and the Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ketone intermediates to provide diverse enantiomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. The excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) with a wide substrate scope in this one&#8208;pot strategy were obtained.

The excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) with a wide substrate scope in this one-pot strategy were obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Rearrangement for Remote Functionalizations of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes were realized utilizing commercially available organofluorine reagents through scission of C&#8722;H/C&#8722;Br bonds via 1,2&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;migration process, leading to di and mono&#8208;fluoroalkyl functionalized ketone compounds with good functional group tolerance. This transformation tolerates a diverse set of migrating groups, involving (hetero)arenes, olefins, and alkynes.







Abstract
An electrochemical strategy for the dual functionalizations of unactivated alkenes through an intramolecular migration process was realized in the absence of sacrificial chemical oxidants and noble&#8208;metal catalysts under mild reaction conditions. The electrochemistry enabled a (hetero)aryl migration while providing access to alkenyl/alkynyl&#8208;migration products. Thus, electricity was employed for the formation of functionalized fluoroalkyl radicals through activation of C&#8722;H/C&#8722;Br bonds from fluorinated esters. Thereby, we obtained a variety of di and mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl products with good functional group tolerance as well as chemo, and regioselectivities. Likewise, defluorinative allylation of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl alkyl bromides proved viable. The reaction mechanism was established by experiments and computations.

         <title>Unveiling Photodegradation and Photosensitization Mechanisms of Unconjugated Pterins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the crucial role of unconjugated pterins in enzymatic processes and the photosensitization of singlet oxygen and other biomolecules, the mechanism underlying the photochemistry of these chromophores is still unclear. With the help of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we shed light into the very fast triplet&#8208;state population, their photodegradation pathways, and the photosensitization of biomolecules.







Abstract
Unconjugated pterins are ubiquitous molecules that participate in countless enzymatic processes and are potentially involved in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen, amino acids, and nucleotides. Following electronic excitation with UV&#8208;A light, some of these pterins degrade, producing hydrogen peroxide as the main side product. This process, which is known to take place in&#8197;vivo, contributes to oxidative stress and melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. In this work, we present for the first time mechanistic insight into the formation of transient triplet species that simultaneously trigger Type I and Type II photosensitizing processes and the initiation of degradation processes. Our calculations reveal that photodegradation of 6&#8208;biopterin, which accumulates in the skin of vitiligo patients, leads to 6&#8208;formylpterin through a retro&#8208;aldol reaction, and subsequently to 6&#8208;carboxypterin through a water&#8208;mediated aldehyde oxidation. Additionally, we show that the changes in the photosensitizing potential of these systems with pH come from the modulation of their excited&#8208;state redox potentials.

         <title>Latent Pronucleophiles in Lewis Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Allylation of Silyl Enol Ethers with Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis base catalyzed allylations of C&#8208;centered nucleophiles have been largely limited to the niche substrates with acidic C&#8208;H substituted for C&#8208;F bonds at the stabilized carbanionic carbon. Herein we report that the concept of latent pronucleophiles serves to overcome these limitations and allow for a variety of common stabilized C&#8208;nucleophiles, when they are introduced as the corresponding silylated compounds, to undergo enantioselective allylations using allylic fluorides. The reactions of silyl enol ethers afford the allylation products in good yields and with high degree of regio / stereoselectivity as well as diastereoselectivity when cyclic silyl enol ethers are used. Further examples of silylated stabilized carbon nucleophiles that undergo efficient allylation speak in favor of the general applicability of this concept to C&#8208;centered nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of an efficient process that produces bioactive medium&#8208;sized N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds from 2&#8208;substituted anilines using either iodosobenzene or (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene&#160;is reported. The tether between the sulfonamide and the aryl group can be varied to access dihydroacridine&#8208;, dibenzazepine&#8208;, or dibenzazocine scaffolds. While substitution on the aniline portion is limited to electron&#8208;neutral&#8208; or electron&#8208;poor groups, a broader range of functional groups are tolerated on the&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent and site selective C&#8208;NAr bond formation can be achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that medium&#8208;ring formation occurs via&#160;radical reactive intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Dissection of Epsin&#8208;1 N&#8208;Terminal Helical Peptide: The Role of Hydrophobic Residues in Modulating Membrane Curvature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The induction of local changes in membrane structure often plays a pivotal role for cellular life. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein to induce positive membrane curvature and its N&#8208;terminal segment (EpN18) plays a key role. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 for a better understanding of general curvature&#8208;modulating mechanisms and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane structure.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal structural alterations in cellular membranes are the hallmark of many vital processes. In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles formation. Its N&#8208;terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature&#8208;inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i)&#8197;enhancing membrane interactions, (ii)&#8197;helix structuring, (iii)&#8197;inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv)&#8197;loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was obtained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa&#8208;arginine cell&#8208;penetrating peptides into living cells.

A predictive DFT study of L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct, able to act as a masked Lewis superacid. It provides a novel strategy to use M&#8208;ORF/L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 couples to generate catalytically active M+ centers featuring weakly coordinating aluminate counter anion.







Abstract
A DFT study of several L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 1&#8208;SiPr2 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct. 1&#8208;SiPr2 was shown to act as a masked Lewis superacid able to release Al(ORF)3 under mild conditions. It could be used to abstract a ORF&#8722; ligand from (bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)2 (bipyMe2&#8201;:&#8201;6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl) and generate the nickel alkoxide complex [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(iPr2S)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 5. Ligand exchange of iPr2S by Ph3P yielded [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(PPh3)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 6.

         <title>CO&#8208;Preserving Photoinduced Transfer of Cymantrenyl Moiety: a Tandem Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;exchangable CO: When one observes that the reaction product contains the same quantity of CO ligands as the substrate, it is natural to suspect that they do not detach during the reaction. We present a reaction where this is not the case and highlight the role of cage effect in this conundrum.







Abstract
Cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (cymantrene) is known to undergo photochemical reactions by releasing one of its CO ligands. Here we present the first example of a photorearrangement of a cymantrenylmethyl fragment, where it retains all its three CO ligands. A tandem experimental and DFT (density functional theory)&#8208;based computational investigation allows us to explain this unexpected behavior: the rearrangement, indeed, begins with the release of one CO ligand, but cage effect of the solvent captures this CO molecule, allowing it to rapidly reattach once the rearrangement takes place.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcoming limitations: Deracemization represents an attractive strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. How to compensate for the decrease in entropy and prevent microreversibility pose two unavoidable challenges. In recent years, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven asymmetric photocatalysis has been recognized as a promising tool to overcome the limitations, given that a number of deracemization reactions have been established. This review summarizes and discusses these important achievements.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis has long been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. In addition to precise enantiocontrol, high&#8208;atom economy, which is crucial for practicality, has always been pursued by chemists in the development of methodologies. Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated to be a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success is its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents, thus undermining the original advantages. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single&#8208;electron transfer in photocatalysis.

         <title>Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based drug design process is used to build inhibitors for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cholesterol oxidase enzymes CYP125 and CYP142. Elaboration of initial fragment screen used an iterative approach combining high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures, biophysical characterization, and structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). The resulting compounds yielded potent micromolar cellular activity against clinically relevant drug resistant Mtb strains.







Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host&#8208;derived lipids such as cholesterol not only support Mtb growth, but are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure&#8208;guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in&#8208;cell activity against clinically relevant drug&#8208;resistant isolates were obtained. These will incite further development of much&#8208;needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb pathogenesis.

         <title>Vanadium Pentafulvene Complexes: Synthon for Unprecedented VanadoceneIII Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) is exchanged with pentafulvenes to yield the first vanadium complexes with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordinating pentafulvene. Consecutive reactivity studies concerning element&#8208;H activation and insertion reactions of multiple bond containing substrates produced rare examples of vandoceneIII phenolate, alcoholate, and amide complexes with certain structure elucidation by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) (1) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b) and benzofulvene complexes (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordination mode with a vanadiumIII center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6&#8208;dimethylpentafulvene, a C&#8722;H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring&#8208;substituted vanadoceneII 4. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadoceneIII compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E&#8722;H splitting of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadoceneIII phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V&#8722;Cexo bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4&#8208;chlorobenzonitril and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

&lt;p&gt;The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;) and benzofulvene complexes (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a &#960;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;:&#963;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode with a vanadium&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6-dimethylpentafulvene, a C&#8722;H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring-substituted vanadocene&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadocene&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E&#8722;H splitting of 4-&lt;i&gt;tert-&lt;/i&gt;butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6-diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadocene&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;exo&lt;/sub&gt; bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4-chlorobenzonitril and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulation of the Oxidase Mimetic Activity of Ceria Nanoparticles by Buffer Composition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Nanozymes: The buffer compositions have different effects on the oxidase mimetic activity of ceria nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) are important typical nanozymes with multiple enzyme mimetic activities, which could facilitate the oxidation of organic dyes in acidic conditions, because of the oxidase mimetic activity. Usually, the regulation of oxidase mimetic activity is focused on the adjustment of the structure, morphology, composition, surface, and other factors of nanozymes. However, the influence of the surrounding environment is not considered, which is very important during the reaction process. In this work, the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs in buffer solutions including citric acid, acetic acid and glycine buffer solutions was investigated, with the results that carboxyl group in buffer solution could adsorb the CNPs on the surface to promote the oxidase mimetic activity. Due to the chelation with the cerium ion, the enhancement is more significant by molecules with polycarboxylic groups, and the enhancement is more efficient by carboxyl molecules in buffer solution, compared with the modification of the carboxyl groups on the surface, because of easier operation and smaller steric hindrance. From the viewpoint of increasing the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs, the work is expected to provide references for the selection of the reaction systems to optimize the oxidase mimetic activity in bio&#8208;detection applications.

         <title>Insight of Cd2+ removal by MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown great potential as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. Nevertheless, howthe host&#8208;guest interactions of LDHs affect the removal mechanism remains to be less explored. Herein, we fabricated CO32&#8208;/NO3&#8208;/SO42&#8208;/Cl&#8208; intercalated MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions and investigated their removal mechanism for Cd2+. The removal capacity increased in the order of MgAl&#8208;CO3 (127.3 mg/g) &lt; MgAl&#8208;SO4 (173.3 mg/g) &lt; MgAl&#8208;NO3 (305.0 mg/g) &#8776; MgAl&#8208;Cl (312.5 mg/g). The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ XRD and XAS demonstrated that Cd2+ was removed in the form of CdCO3 for MgAl&#8208;CO3, while for MgAl&#8208;Cl/NO3/SO4, Cd2+ was all removed in the form of CdAl&#8208;LDHs with isomorphic substitution mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that the lower Gibbs free energy in the formation of CdCO3 than CdAl&#8208;LDHs made it easier to remove Cd2+ by CdCO3 on MgAl&#8208;CO3. Conversely, isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8208;NO3 to CdAl&#8208;LDHs was a free energy reduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine ligated by an acridane derived NNN pincer ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The steric tuning of a tridentate acridane&#8208;derived NNN pincer ligand allows for the isolation of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine that exhibits ambiphilic reactivity. Well&#8208;defined phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is reported, contrasting with prior reports on this class of compounds. Reactions towards oxidants are also described. The latter result in the two&#8208;electron oxidation of the phosphorus atom from +III to +V, and are accompanied by a strong geometric distortion of the NNN pincer ligand. By contrast, cooperative activation of E&#8211;H (HCl, HBcat, HOMe) bonds proceeds with retention of the phosphorus redox state. When using H2O as a substrate, the reaction results in the full disassembly of H2O to its constituent atoms, highlighting the potential of this platform for small molecule activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Acylsilanes are an important class of organosilicon compounds that have gained increased attention recently. Their various reaction modes in particularly their ability to generate carbenes under thermal or photochemical conditions render them valuable reagents in organic synthesis. In this communication, an unprecedented route towards acylsilanes is reported by introducing the acylsilane moiety directly in a single step through alkene hydrosilylation. In this context, acylhydrosilanes representing a novel class of acylsilanes are introduced and applied as silylation reagents in rhodium catalyzed alkene hydrosilylations to access a great variety of acylsilanes. These reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance and atom economy.</dc:description>

However, current synthetic strategies for non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based NiCoP concave nanostructure still remain challenging.

As an electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction, the HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs exhibit remarkably enhanced activity and stability, with small overpotential of 289 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2, surpassing the NiCoP nanocages and commercial RuO2. The superior OER performance of HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs is originated from the highly branched concave structure, the synergistic effect between bimetal Ni and Co atoms, as well as the electronic structure modulation from P.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning the Properties of Stapled Peptides by Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids were used as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs library of an IL&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the staples chirality (L/D) impacts on the peptide&#8216;s properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and binding affinity of the modified peptide compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges.







Abstract
Peptide stapling represents a versatile strategy to generate peptide derivatives with stable helical structures. While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated &#945;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs of an interleukin&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the interleukin&#8208;17A(IL&#8208;17A)&#8208;binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (L/D) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL&#8208;17A&#8208;inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.

     alt="Fine Tuning the Properties of Stapled Peptides by Stereogenic &#945;-Amino Acid Bridges"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Amino Acids were used as bridges to construct side chain-stapled analogs library of an IL-17A-binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the staples chirality (L/D) impacts on the peptide&#8216;s properties. While all AA-derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-AA-based staples generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and binding affinity of the modified peptide compared to the &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-amino acid bridges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide stapling represents a versatile strategy to generate peptide derivatives with stable helical structures. While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated &#945;-amino acids (&#945;-AAs) as bridges to construct side chain-stapled analogs of an interleukin-17A-binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA-derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-amino acid bridges, the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-AA-based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the interleukin-17A(IL-17A)-binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (&lt;i&gt;L/D&lt;/i&gt;) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL-17A-inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of Enantioenriched Epoxides and Triols from Biomass&#8208;Derived Synthons Driven by Specifically Designed Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the design and application of multi&#8208;step enzymatic cascades to synthesize enantioenriched epoxides and vicinal aromatic triols from simple biomass&#8208;derived starting materials in one pot. These artificial metabolic pathways involve a tailor&#8208;made aldolase, a highly evolved cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme, and when needed a specifically chosen epoxide hydrolase. These attractive biocatalytic cascades can be performed under environmentally benign conditions, such as the use of aqueous media and mild temperatures, and do not require the isolation of reaction intermediates. Good to excellent conversions, high enantioselectivity, and moderate to good product yields are achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor&#8208;made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an effective aldolase with 160&#8208;fold increased activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4&#8208;OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4&#8208;OT mutant, in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) from biomass&#8208;derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68&#8201;% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three&#8208;step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3&#8208;prim,sec,sec&#8208;triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor&#8208;less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass&#8208;based synthons.

         <title>Enhanced performance of CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell by modified zinc oxide nanorods array with [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Metal oxide ZnO is widely used as electron transport layers in all&#8208;inorganic PSCs due to high electron mobility, high transmittance, and simple preparation processing, the surface defects of ZnO suppress the quality of perovskite film and inhibit the solar cells&#8217; performance. In this work, [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PCBA) modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) is employed as electron transport layer&#160;in perovskite solar cells.&#160;The resulting perovskite film coated on the zinc oxide nanorods has better crystallinity and uniformity, facilitating charge carrier transportation, reducing recombination losses, and ultimately improving the cells&#8217; performance. The perovskite solar cell with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO nanorods/PCBA/CsPbIBr2/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au delivers a high short circuit current density of 11.83 mA cm&#8208;2 and power conversion efficiency of 12.05 %.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides as a novel tool for conformational modification in peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of 15 cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine and 10 cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides containing one or two backbone N&#8208;aryl amide bonds were synthesized by following a combination of solution phase and solid phase peptide synthesis. NMR based conformational studies of these N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine peptides have revealed five distinct template conformations with antiparallel beta sheet structure, and that of N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides have revealed three template structures. All the template structures have distinct peptide turn features. The conformations in theseN&#8208;aryl peptides were compared to those in the commonly studied N&#8208;methyl peptide analogs. We observed that the N&#8208;aryl peptides have exhibited a considerable conformational homogeneity, and their conformations have significantly differed from those in N&#8208;methyl analogs. We anticipate that the N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides has the potential for its application as a novel tool for conformational and physicochemical modification in peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide&#8208;Substituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Salts as Useful Synthetic Synthons: Access to Triazenyl Radicals and Staudinger type Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic carbenes (MIC) are a popular class of compound that are heavily investigated at the moment. The access to cationic MICs, and the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals are two highly attractive fields that have hardly been explored until now. Here we report the synthesis and characterisation of three different cationic azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts, used as building blocks for the study of their reactivity towards triphenylphosphine, where the reactivity is dependent on the nature of the starting triazolium salt. Furthermore, we have used the cationic triazolium salts to develop a series of unsymmetrical MIC&#8208;triazene&#8208;NHC/MIC&#8217; compounds, which can be readily converted to the radical form either via electrochemical or chemical methods. These radicals, which display NIR electrochromism, were investigated using a battery of techniques such as electrochemistry, UV/Vis/NIR and, EPR spectroelectrochemistry and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the MIC plays an important role in the stabilization of the triazenyl radical, particularly in a competitive role vis a vis their NHC counterparts. These results shed new light into the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals, and possibly also on their &#960;&#8208;accepting ability.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of eight different cationic emitters with emission properties in solution and in solid&#8208;state (solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; SSSE) is presented. These compounds, bearing either ammonium or pyridinium groups, have been investigated regarding their photophysical properties as well as their potential application in biological imaging. Besides high quantum yields as well as a high degree of stability during the imaging process, it was additionally revealed that a broad range of biological targets can be addressed, such as different bacterial strains, human cells as well as protists. The reported SSSE approach employing the mentioned robust emitters for biological imaging, will contribute to a rapid and facile way to design and apply affordable emitters with outstanding properties. Additionally, these emitters will overcome the drawbacks of classical luminophores and agents featuring well&#8208;known aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) properties.</dc:description>

Azomethineylide [3+2] cycloadditions are a promising strategy for the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidines. In this Review, recent developments in the enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide by metal catalysis are summarized.







Abstract
Asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition reactions are fascinating and powerful methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolidines up to four stereocentres. Pyrrolidines are important compounds for both biology and organocatalytic applications. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of pyrrolidines by [3+2] cycloadditions of azomethine ylides using metal catalysis. It has been organized by the type of metal catalysis used and further arranged by the complexity nature of dipolarophile. The presentation of each reaction type highlights their advantages and limitations.

         <title>Small Molecule Activation on a Base&#8208;stabilized Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene towards N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and H&#8722;E (E=Si, P, B) bonds was studied. Reactions of the P(I) species with unsaturated compounds, such as tetrachlorobenzaquinone, benzaldehyde and phenylisocyanate, was also investigated.







Abstract
Reduction of (NP)PCl2 (NP=phosphinoamidinate [PhC(NAr)(=NPPri2)]&#8722;) with KC8 affords the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P (9). Reaction of 9 with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (MeC(NMe))2C: results in the NHC&#8208;adduct NHC&#8594;P&#8722;P(Pri2)=NC(Ph)=NAr featuring an iminophosphinyl group. Reactions of 9 with HBpin and H3SiPh led to the metathesis products (NP)Bpin and (NP)SiH2Ph, respectively, whereas with HPPh2 a base&#8208;stabilized phosphido&#8208;phosphinidene, the product of N&#8722;P and H&#8722;P bond metathesis, was obtained. Reaction of 9 with tetrachlorobenzaquinone results in oxidation of P(I) to P(III), accompanied by oxidation of the amidophosphine ligand into P(V). Addition of benzaldehyde to 9 results in a phospha&#8208;Wittig reaction affording a product of P=P and C=O bond metathesis. Related reaction with phenylisocyanate results in a product of N&#8722;P(=O)Pri2 addition to the C=N bond of an intermediate iminophosphaalkene to produce a phosphinidene intramolecularly stabilized by a diaminocarbene.

         <title>Efficient K&#8208;Storage of Fe&#8208;Coupled Organic Molecule Anode in Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal coupling strategy combined with electrolytes regulation are adopted to develop a novel organic K&#8208;storage anode of Fe&#8208;NTCDA with improved specific capacity and long cycle stability in the optimized 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes, attributed to the increased K&#8208;storage sites as well as enhanced K+ transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Given these advantages of widely designable structures and environmentally friendly characteristics, organic electrode materials (OEMs) are considered to be promising electrode materials for alkaline metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, their large&#8208;scale application is hampered by insufficient specific capacity and rate performance. Here, Fe2+ is coupled to the anhydride molecule NTCDA to form a novel K&#8208;storage anode Fe&#8208;NTCDA. In this way, the working potential of Fe&#8208;NTCDA anode is reduced, which makes it more suitable to be used as an anode material. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved due to the increase in K&#8208;storage sites. Moreover, electrolytes regulation is implemented to optimize the K&#8208;storage behavior, resulting into a high specific capacity of 167&#8197;mAh/g after 100 cycles at 50&#8197;mA/g and 114&#8197;mAh/g even at 500&#8197;mA/g in the 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes.

         <title>No Transition Metals Required &#8211; Oxygen Promoted Synthesis of Imines from Primary Alcohols and Amines under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal free: The synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohol and anilines promoted by oxygen and KOtBu at room temperature in the absence of a transition metal catalyst is described. The detailed investigation of the radical mechanism is presented revealing complex reaction paths and branching patterns.







Abstract
The synthesis of imines denotes a cornerstone in organic chemistry. The use of alcohols as renewable substituents for carbonyl&#8208;functionality represents an attractive opportunity. Consequently, carbonyl moieties can be in&#8197;situ generated from alcohols upon transition&#8208;metal catalysis under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, bases can be utilized under aerobic conditions. In this context, we report the synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohols and anilines, promoted by KOtBu under aerobic conditions at room temperature, in the absence of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst. A detailed investigation of the radical mechanism of the underlying reaction is presented. This reveals a complex reaction network fully supporting the experimental findings.

         <title>Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Based Cuboid Constructed by Chiral Self&#8208;Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuboid, a basic geometric structure, has been widely applied in architecture and mathematics. In chemistry, the introduction of cuboid structures always provides a specific structural shape, enhances the stability of the structure and improves the performance of materials. In this study, we propose a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;discrimination to construct a cuboid&#8208;stacking crystal material, in which a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) based on Tr&#246;ger's base (TB) and benzophenone (BP) was synthesized as the building element of the cuboid. The cuboid is designed to be transformable compared with cuboid structures in previous work. For this reason, it is considering that the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure can be transformed through external stimulation. Iodine vapor is selected as the external stimulus to transform the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure due to the favorable interaction between iodine and the cuboid. The changes in the stacking mode of TBBP is studied by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). To our surprise, this Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;based cuboid shows strong iodine adsorption capacity up to 3.43 g g&#8722;1 and exhibits potential as a crystal material for iodine adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Hydroxyl Group&#8208;Assisted Preparation of Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adjustable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework UiO&#8208;66 Composites: Towards Continuous Oil Collection and Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a straightforward and effective hydrophobic modification for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) under mild conditions is meaningful for MOF applications. Here, a post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8208;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid (TPA) is the essential force for the modifier TPA. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for efficient oil&#8208;water separation by coating TPA&#8208;modified UiO&#8208;66 (P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) on commercial melamine sponges (MS) and filter papers (FP). The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS composite could quickly and selectively absorb oily liquids up to 43 times its weight from water. P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/FP and P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS showed high separation efficiencies for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, respectively, with high resistance to low/high temperatures and acid/base conditions. The metal hydroxyl group&#8208;assisted post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy offers a facile and broad way to prepare hydrophobic MOFs for promising applications in environmental fields.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of perylenediimide (PDI) building blocks in materials for organic electronic is of considerable interest. This popular n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is tuned by introducing peripheral groups in their ortho and bay positions. Such modifications radically alter their optoelectronic properties. In this article, we describe an efficient method to afford regioisomerically pure 1,6/7&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208; and (NH2)2&#8208;PDIs employing two key steps: the selective crystallization of 1,6&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxy tetrabutylester and the nitration of regiopure 1,7&#8208;Br2&#8208;PDI with silver nitrite. The optoelectronic properties of the resulting regioisomerically pure dinitro, diamino&#8208;PDIs and bisazacoronenediimides (BACDs) are reported and demonstrate the need to separate both regioisomers of such n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for their inclusion in advanced optoelectronic devices. For the first time, the two regioisomers of the same PDI starting material are available on the multigram scale, which will stimulate the exploration of regioisomerism/properties relationship for this family of dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>To Isomerize or not to Isomerize?
E  /Z&#160;Isomers of Cyclic Azobenzene Derivatives and their Reactivity upon One&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azo compounds are efficient electron acceptors. Upon one&#8208;electron reduction they generally isomerize forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. Here we show that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species. Markedly, diazonines, which bear a central nine membered heterocycle, show light induced&#160;E/Z&#160;isomerization, but retain the configuration of the diazene N=N moiety upon one&#8208;electron reduction. Accordingly,&#160;E/Z&#160;isomerization is not induced by reduction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of acetals in acidic Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) in which the solvent itself participates in the catalytic promotion of the reaction is herein reported. The reaction is performed under feasible conditions, open air, without the need of external additives, catalysts or water removing techniques and it is wide in scope. The products are easily recovered and the reaction medium is fully recycled and reused without weakening of its catalytic activity after 10 times. Remarkably, the entire process has been realized on gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Four New Sb&#8208;based Orthophosphates: Cation Regulation to Investigate Diversified Structural Architecture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the work, four new Sb&#8208;based phosphates, K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3, Rb(SbO2)2PO4, Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32, were successfully synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature melt method. Among them, Rb(SbO2)2PO4 and Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 are the first reported examples of Rb&#8208;containing alkali metal Sb&#8208;based phosphates. They show three&#8208;dimensional (3D) frameworks composed of [Sb8P4O30]&#8734; layer for K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3 and [Sb6P2O20]&#8734; layer for Rb(SbO2)2PO4, and 2D lamellar structure composed of [Sb3P2O10]&#8734; for Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32. A detailed structural comparison shows that the structure dimensions for them transfer from 1D to complex 3D framework with the increase of (Sb+P)/O ratio, which affects performances of the compounds. Optical property and energy band structure calculations were also carried out based on the density functional theory (DFT). The present study enriches the diversity of Sb&#8208;based phosphates and paves the way for further explore their optical properties in the future.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The patterning strategy of organic semiconductors&#160;is&#160;a crucial&#160;issue for integrated circuit. However, due to the uncontrollable liquid dewetting, most of the research is mainly focused on the patterning of single component, few works have been done on the patterning of multi&#8208;component or heterojunction, which play an important role in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, a capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for patterning of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) micro&#8208;arrays, with liquid crystalline BTR and PC71BM utilized as donor and acceptor, respectively. The BTR:PC71BM arrays&#160;presented&#160;hierarchical morphology with suitable phase separation, which contributes to the efficient charge generation and transport. Moreover, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance&#160;with&#160;the light on/off ratio higher than 2000, the responsivity of 40.57 A W&#8722;1, and specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#160;Jones. Such progress demonstrates that the capillary&#8208;bridge strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality BHJ micropatterns arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Solid Phase Glycan Synthesis: ASGS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid phase synthesis is the most dominant approach for the preparation of biological oligomers as it enables the introduction of monomers iteratively. Accelerated solid phase synthesis of biological oligomers is crucial for chemical biology, but its application to the synthesis of oligosaccharides is not trivial. Solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide assembly is a slow process performed in a variety of conditions and temperatures, requires an inert gas atmosphere, and demands high excess of glycosyl donors. The process is done in special synthesizers and poor mixing of the solid support increases the risk of diffusion&#8208;independent hydrolysis of the activated donors. High shear stirring is a new way to accelerate solid phase synthesis. The efficient mixing ensures that reactive intermediates can diffuse faster to the solid support thereby increasing the kinetics of the reactions. We report here a stirring&#8208;based accelerated solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis. We harnessed high shear mixing to perform diffusion&#8208;dependent glycosylation in a short reaction time. We minimized the use of glycosyl donors and the need to use an inert atmosphere. We showed that by tailoring the deprotection and glycosylation conditions to the same temperature, assembly steps are performed continuously, and full glycosylation cycles is completed in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Chiral Resolution of a MnIII Spin Crossover Complex with High&#160;Temperature 80 K Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;centrosymmetric spin switchable systems are of interest for their prospective applications as magnetically active non&#8208;linear optical materials and in multiferroic devices. Chiral resolution of simple spin crossover chelates complexes into the &#916; and &#923; forms offers a facile route to homochiral magnetic switches, which could be easily enantiomerically enriched. Here, we report the spontaneous resolution of new hysteretic spin crossover complex, [MnIII(sal2323)]SCN&#183;EtOH (1), into &#916; and &#923; forms, without the use of chiral reagents, where sal2323 is the Schiff base resulting from condensation of 1,2&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropylamino)ethane with 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. The enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism, and quantum chemistry calculations were used to investigate the electronic structure. The opening of a wide&#160;80 K&#160;thermal hysteresis window at high temperature&#160;highlights the potential for good magneto&#8208;optical function at ambient temperature for&#160;materials of this type.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Aromaticity of an Alternating Cyclo[4]Thiophene[4]Furan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on a new class of conjugated macrocycle, the cyclo[4]thiophene[4]furan hexyl ester (C4TE4FE). This cycle consists of alternating alpha&#8208;linked thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;ester and furan&#8208;3&#8208;ester repeat units, and was prepared in a single step using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)furan monomer. The ester side groups help promote a syn conformation of the heterocycles, which enables formation of the macrocycle. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that C4TE4FE could undergo multiple oxidations, so treatment with SbCl5 resulted in formation of the [C4TE4FE]2+ dication. Computational work, paired with 1H NMR spectroscopy of the dication, revealed that the cycle becomes globally aromatic upon 2e&#8208; oxidation, as the annulene pathway along the outer ring becomes H&#252;ckel aromatic. The change in ring current for the cycle upon oxidation was clear from 1H NMR spectroscopy, as the protons of the thiophene and furan rings shifted downfield by nearly 6 ppm. This work highlights the potential of sequence control in furan&#8208;based macrocycles to tune electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallic and dimensional optimization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfuric resources. However, their commercial application is limited by rapid capacity decline and low Coulombic efficiency. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) made of metallic nodes and organic ligands can suppress polysulfide shuttling and promote redox kinetics. In this paper, the effects of crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories on chemical performance of LSBs have been meticulously explored electrochemical performance. As a result, exposed Ni active sites in a lamellar Ni&#8208;MOF was found to deliver a superior electrochemical performance. The as&#8208;assembled LSBs with 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs cathode deliver a much superior initial discharge capacity, (820 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C), and exhibit excellent cycling stability over 550 cycles than those analogues of 3D stereoscopic Ni&#8208;MOF and 2D lamellar Co&#8208;MOF. This work proposed a perspective in elevating LSBs performance through synergistic optimization of the MOFs dimensions and the metallic nuclei in the cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Numerical simulation and experimental study of methyl ammonium bismuth iodide absorber layer based lead free perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed a tremendous surge in the design and fabrication of lead&#8208;(Pb) free perovskite or perovskite&#8208;like materials for the construction of perovskite solar cells. The simulation and fabrication of Pb free perovskite&#8208;like structures based perovskite solar cells are of great significance. In present study, we have simulated methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) based perovskite solar cells using solar cell capacitance software (SCAPS). The thickness of the electron&#8208;transport layer, hole&#8208;transport layer and absorber layer were optimized via SCAPS. The simulated perovskite solar cells (FTO/TiO2/MA3Bi2I9/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au) with optimized conditions demonstrated good power conversion efficiency of 14.07% with reasonable open circuit voltage of 1.34 V via SCAPS. In further studies, we also fabricated perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity which showed power conversion efficiency of 1.31%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Ketyl Radical Initiated Cketyl&#8208;Csp2/Csp3&#160;Coupling on ZnIn2S4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8211;C bond formation utilizing ketyl radical (Cketyl) species has attracted increasing attention recently, as it provides a direct route for the synthesis of complex molecules. However, the most&#8208;developed homogeneous photocatalytic systems for the generation and utilization of ketyl radicals usually entail noble metal&#8208;based (e.g., Ru and Ir) photosensitizers, which suffer from not only high cost but also potential degradation and hence pose challenges in product separation and purification. In contrast, readily accessible, inexpensive, and recyclable semiconductors represent attractive alternative photocatalysts but remain much less explored for photocatalytic ketyl radical initiated C&#8211;C bond formation. Herein, we demonstrate that a wide range of industrially important chemicals, including substituted chromanes and tertiary alcohols, can be produced on ZnIn2S4 under visible light irradiation through intra&#8208;molecular cyclization (Cketyl&#8211;Csp2) and inter&#8208;molecular cross&#8208;coupling (Cketyl&#8211;Csp3) reactions, respectively, using ketyl radicals. A suite of experimental studies aided by computational investigation were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic insights of these two types of ketyl radical initiated C&#8211;C coupling reactions on ZnIn2S4.</dc:description>

In contrast, readily accessible, inexpensive, and recyclable semiconductors represent attractive alternative photocatalysts but remain much less explored for photocatalytic ketyl radical initiated C&#8211;C bond formation. Herein, we demonstrate that a wide range of industrially important chemicals, including substituted chromanes and tertiary alcohols, can be produced on ZnIn2S4 under visible light irradiation through intra-molecular cyclization (Cketyl&#8211;Csp2) and inter-molecular cross-coupling (Cketyl&#8211;Csp3) reactions, respectively, using ketyl radicals. A suite of experimental studies aided by computational investigation were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic insights of these two types of ketyl radical initiated C&#8211;C coupling reactions on ZnIn2S4.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyridone&#8208;Doped Acenes with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Besides the peripheral modification, the introduction of heteroatoms to modulate the property of longer acenes with improved chemical stability has been extensively studied for their potential applications in organic electronics. However, the utilization of 4&#8208;pyridone, a common unit in the air&#8208; and photo&#8208;stable acridone and quinacridone, to decorate higher acenes with increased stability has not been realized yet. Here we present the synthesis of a series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes up to heptacene via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination of aniline and dibromo&#8208;ketone. The effect of pyridone on the property of doped acenes were investigated experimentally and computationally. With the &#960;&#8208;extension of doped acenes, the pyridone ring shows the weakened conjugation and gradual loss of aromaticity. The doped acenes demonstrate enhanced stability in solution and maintain the electron communication between the acene planes.</dc:description>

         <title>Au nanozyme driven cascading catalysis in Tollens' reaction: An insight of glucose oxidase&#8208;like mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven to be excellent glucose oxidase (GOx) mimics, which can catalyze the electrons transform pathway from glucose to oxygen. This study confirmed AuNPs can accelerate the reaction between [Ag(NH3)2]+&#160;and glucose under alkaline conditions, which is also known as the Tollens'&#160;reaction, and the possible mechanism was proposed. Here, [Ag(NH3)2]+ instead of O2 acted directedly as an electron acceptor during glucose oxidation catalyzed by AuNPs, accompanied by hydrogen transfer. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanoparticles can also catalyze this process, similar to AuNPs, via a unique cascading catalysis mechanism in the Tollens' reaction. A simple and heatless glucose colorimetric assay can be established based on the plasmonic band of AgNPs with a liner range of 0.6&#8211;22.2 &#956;M, and the limit of detection is 0.32 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>DFT mechanistic investigation on manganese pincer complex catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper the density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to investigate the cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate catalyzed by Mn&#8208;PNN pincer complex. The whole reaction process mainly includes three stages: the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the coupling of benzaldehyde with methanol to hemiacetal and the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal to methyl benzoate. The calculated results indicated that two dehydrogenation processes are influenced by two competitive mechanisms of inner and outer spheres. Dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is the rate&#8208;determining step of the whole reaction, with the energy barrier of 22.1 kcal/mol. In addition, the regeneration of catalyst is also extremely important. Compared with direct dehydrogenation, the dehydrogenation mode assisted by formic acid is more advantageous. This work might provide theoretical insights and shed light on the design of cheap transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Hybrid Composed of Anisotropic Niobate Layers Modified with MoC Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hybrid composed of anisotropic niobate layers modified with MoC nanoparticles is synthesized by multistep reactions. The stepwise interlayer reactions for layered hexaniobate induce selective surface modification at the alternate interlayers and the following ultrasonication leads to the formation of double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The further liquid phase MoC deposition with the double layered nanosheets leads to the decoration of MoC nanoparticles on the surfaces of the double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The new hybrid can be regarded as a stacking of the two layers with anisotropically modified nanoparticles. The relatively high temperature in the MoC synthesis causes partial leaching of the grafted phosphonate groups, and the exposed surface of the niobate nanosheets due to the partial leaching may interact with MoC to succeed the hybridization. The hybrid after heating exhibits photocatalytic activity, indicating that this hybridization method can be useful for hybrid synthesis of semiconductor nanosheets and co&#8208;catalyst nanoparticles toward photocatalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Tetrathiafulvalene and Nickel&#8722;Bis(dithiolene) Units into Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Stable and Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) are typical conductive units widely studied in electronics, optics, and photochemistry. However, their applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion are often limited by insufficient NIR absorption and low chemical/thermal stability. Herein, we integrate TTF and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) into a covalent organic framework (COF) with stable and efficient NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance. Two isostructural COFs, namely Ni&#8208;TTF and TTF&#8208;TTF, are successfully isolated which are composed of TTF and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) units as donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) pairs or TTF units only. Both COFs show high BET surface areas and good chemical/thermal stability. Notably, compared with TTF&#8208;TTF, the periodic D&#8208;A arrangement in Ni&#8208;TTF significantly lowers the bandgap, leading to unprecedented NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanol&#8208;Supported Lanthanide Complexes for Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence at 1550 nm.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) at 1550 nm is reported from lanthanide complexes supported by Vanol; these are the first examples of coordination of Vanol to lanthanides. A change in the ligand design from a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (in Binol) to a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol (in Vanol) results in significantly improved dissymmetry factors for (Vanol)3ErNa3 (|glum| = 0.64) at 1550 nm. This is the highest reported dissymmetry factor to date in the telecom C&#8208;band region, and among the highest for any lanthanide complexes. Comparative solid&#8208;state structural analysis of (Vanol)3ErNa3 and (Binol)3ErNa3 suggests that a less distorted geometry around the metal center is in part responsible for the high chiroptical metrics of (Vanol)3ErNa3. This phenomenon was further evidenced in the analogous ytterbium complexes (Vanol)3YbNa3 that also exhibit significantly improved dissymmetry factors (|glum| = 0.21). This confirms and generalizes the same observation that was made in other visibly emitting, six&#8208;coordinate lanthanide complexes. Due to their strong CPL at 1550 nm, the reported complexes are potential candidates for applications in quantum communication technologies. More importantly, our structure&#8208;CPL activity relationship study provides guidance towards the generation of even better near infrared&#8208;CPL emitters.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of self&#8208;assembling gluconamide conjugated naphthalimide amphiphiles (GCNA) was synthesized and the self&#8208;assembly of GCNA into gel rendered an increased electron density in naphthalimide moiety with overall change in energy of 15.33x10&#8208;32 J via J&#8208;type aggregation. SEM analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction underpinning the nanofibrillar formation, and rheology confirmed the processablity and material fabrication. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA4 via cooperative intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions makes it as effective electron donor in the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The TENG based on GCNA4&#8208;polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) triboelectric pair generated an output voltage, current and power density of ~250 V, 40 &#956;A and ~622 mW/m2 respectively, which is almost 2.4 times better in performance than the amorphous GCNA4 based TENG. The fabricated TENG can power&#8208;up 240 LEDs, wrist watch, thermometer, calculator and hygrometer.</dc:description>

         <title>Co2+ Doped Biotinylated Carbon Dot: A Theranostic Agent for Target Specific Killing of Cancer Cells via Hypoxia Induced Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional cancer treatments have systematic side effects that stand against its desirable therapeutic efficacy. Alternative strategies using biochemical features of cancer cells to promote apoptosis are finding notable significance. One such important biochemical feature of malignant cells is hypoxia, alteration of which can lead to cell death. Hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF&#8208;1a) has the key role in hypoxia generation. Herein, we synthesized biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) that specifically diagnose and selectively killed cancer cells with 3&#8208;3.1&#8208;fold higher efficiency over non&#8208;cancer cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay in CoCDb treated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells confirmed the increased expression of HIF&#8208;1a that was responsible for efficient killing of cancer cells. In 2D cells and 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis that make CoCDb a potential theranostic agent.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures: importance of dual binding site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 adsorption and activation on Cu single atom catalysts and Cu nanoclusters supported on the (110) surface of rutile and on the (101) surface of anatase TiO2 has been investigated by means of first principles electronic structure calculations. The role of oxide reduction associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies has been considered. Five main messages emerge from this study. (1) CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures is surface sensitive, as the rutile and anatase surfaces can exhibit different behaviours; (2) the surface morphology is essential since CO2 is activated only when the molecule can simultaneously bind to at least two active sites, such as a Cu atom on one side and an oxide ion on the other site; (3) Cu atoms on TiO2 are in +I oxidation state and can bind and activate CO2 via charge transfer from the oxide; (4) on supported Cu clusters CO2 activation occurs mostly at the metal/oxide interface; (5) the presence of O vacancy sites facilitates the spontaneous dissociation of CO2 to CO, or increases the electron density of the metal catalyst, two effects that can influence the mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol or other chemicals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new ligands containing a bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide unit have been used to assemble lantern&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic cages with the general formula [Cu4L4]. Functionalisation of the backbone of the ligands leads to distinct crystal packing motifs between the three cages, as observed with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The three cages vary in their gas sorption behaviour, and the capacity of the materials for CO2 is found to depend on the activation conditions: softer activation conditions lead to superior uptake, and one of the cages displays the highest BET surface area found for lantern&#8208;type cages so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Sequential Catalytic Arylation&#8211;Fukuyama Cross&#8208;coupling of 1,1&#8208;Biszincioalkane Linchpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,1&#8208;Bis(iodozincio)alkanes are used as dinucleophilic linchpins in an enantioselective double cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence involving aryl iodides and then thioesters. The two catalytic C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reactions are achieved in the same pot through two distinct palladium&#8208;based catalytic systems: a first non&#8208;enantioselective one delivering configurationally labile secondary benzylzinc species from an achiral precursor, and a second enantioconvergent one that operates a highly efficient dynamic kinetic resolution of the racemic intermediates. This strategy, new in the area of asymmetric synthesis through two consecutive electrophilic substitution reactions of geminated C(sp3)&#8208;organodimetallics, provides useful methodology to access in a modular fashion acyclic a&#8208;disubstituted ketone products with very high enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8208;H Arylation of Dithiophene&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene: Tuneable Electronic Properties and 2D Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Networks at the Solid/Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiafulvalene is among the most well&#8208;known building blocks in molecular electronics due to its outstanding electron&#8208;donating and redox properties. Among its derivatives, dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) has attracted considerable interest in organic electronics, owing to its high field&#8208;effect mobility. Herein, we report the direct C&#8208;H arylation of DT&#8208;TTF to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups in order to evaluate their influence on the electronic properties by cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Self&#8208;assembly of the DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface. The tetrabenzoic acid derivative can attain a planar geometry on the graphite surface due to van der Waals interactions with the surface and H&#8208;bonding with neighbouring molecules. This study demonstrates a simple method for the synthesis of arylated DT&#8208;TTF derivatives for the construction of novel p&#8208;extended electroactive frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the reactivity of diazaborinines towards the activation of &#963;&#8208;bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poorly understood factors governing the small molecule activation reactions mediated by diazaborinines have been computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the activation of E&#8208;H &#963;&#8208;bonds (E = H, C, Si, N, P, O, S) has been investigated. These reactions, which proceed in a concerted manner, are exergonic and, in general, associated with relatively low activation barriers.In addition, the barrier becomes lower for the E&#8208;H bonds involving the heavier element in the same group (&#916;G&#8800;: C&gt;Si; N&gt;P; O&gt;S). This reactivity trend together with the mode of action of the diazaborinine system are quantitatively analyzed by means of the activation strain model of reactivity in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Helically folded oligoamides of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid composed of up to 41 units were prepared using optimized manual solid phase synthesis (SPS).

         <title>The Role of Anionic Ligands on Photoreactivity in Mo(VI) Dioxo Complexes of the Form MoO2X2(NN)
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study into the light&#8208;initiated C&#8722;H activation reactivity by MoO2X2(bpy) elucidates the critical role of a bpy&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. With stronger donating anionic ancillary ligands, the first excited state involves a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer from the anionic ancillary ligand (X), which initiated radical decomposition instead of C&#8722;H activation via the metal oxo motif.







Abstract
The photoreactivity of d0 metal dioxo complexes in activating C&#8722;H bonds has been recently studied.[1&#8211;3] We have previously reported that MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) is an effective platform for light initiated C&#8722;H activation with unique product selectivity for the overall functionalization.[1] Herein we expand on these studies and report the synthesis and photoreactivity of several new Mo(VI) dioxo complexes with the general formula MoO2(X)2(NN); where X=F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, CH3&#8722;, PhO&#8722;, tBuO&#8722; and NN=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;tBu). Among these compounds, MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) and MoO2Br2(bpy&#8208;tBu) are able to participate in bimolecular photoreactivity with several substrates containing C&#8722;H bonds of various types such as allyls, benzyls, aldehydes (RCHO) and alkanes. MoO2(CH3)2bpy and MoO2(PhO)2bpy do not participate in bimolecular photoreactions and instead they undergo photodecompositions. Computational studies indicate that the nature of the HOMO and LUMO is critical in supporting photoreactivity, with access to an LMCT (bpy&#8594;Mo) being necessary for tractable hydrocarbon functionalization.

         <title>Reactivity of Silylene with Gallium&#8208; and Boron Trihalide at Reductive Conditions Resulting in Unforeseen Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galliumhalosilanes: Synthesis of a first compound comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms. Where one gallium presents between two silylene and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. The oxidation state of the gallium and silicon atoms remains the same even after the reduction. Further reaction of silylene with boron halide leads to the formation of silylene&#8208;boron adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot reaction of gallium and boron halides with potassium graphite in the presence of benzamidinate stabilized silylene LSi&#8208;R, (L=PhC(NtBu)2). The reaction of LSiCl with an equivalent amount of GaI3 in the presence of KC8 leads to the direct substitution of one chloride group by gallium diiodide simultaneously additional coordination of silylene resulted in L(Cl)Si&#8594;GaI2&#8208;Si(L)&#8594;GaI3 (1). In compound 1, the structure comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms where one gallium presents between two silylenes and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. In this Lewis acid&#8208;base reaction the oxidation states of the starting materials remain unchanged. The same is valid in the silylene boron adduct formation of L(tBu)Si&#8208;BPhCl2 (2) and L(tBu)Si&#8208;BBr3 (3). This new route provides access to galliumhalosilanes challenging to synthesize by any other method.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Decorated Nonaromatic Amine Emitters Towards Efficient Triplet Exciton Utilization in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possessed powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, sulfur atom is particularly attractive for boosting triplet exciton utilization in electroluminescence. Here, the sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine compounds served as thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emitters for highly efficient OLED applications are highlighted.







Abstract
Purely organic compounds served as promising materials for organic electronics have intrigued extensive research focuses owing to their unique photophysical and electronic properties. In the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the utilization of triplet excitons is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance devices. In contrast to the traditional aromatic amine&#8208;based counterparts, sulfur atom with a high&#8208;level outer orbit simultaneously provides powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and striking spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect to facilitate the utilization of theoretically spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons, demonstrating great prospect in constructing highly emissive purely organic emitters for OLED applications. Herein, we summarize the currently developed sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine&#8208;based emitters exhibiting attractive photoelectronic characteristics, and gain insight into the understanding of molecular design and photophysical processes of these emitters, providing new perspectives for enriching the existing luminescent material systems and designing high&#8208;performance emitters.

         <title>Metal Complex Molecular Junctions as Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular junctions, which are composed of metal electrode&#8208;molecule&#8208;metal electrode structures, are attractive components of thermoelectric devices. In this Concept article, we discuss recent thermoelectric studies on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential utility of functional metal complex junctions for thermoelectric devices is also described.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule junctions and self&#8208;assembled monolayer junctions are attractive architectures for thermoelectric devices. However, given the poor thermoelectric performance of organic molecules investigated so far, molecules characterized by high conductance and Seebeck coefficient values are desired to be explored. Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8208;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.

         <title>Significant Control on Zero&#8208;Field Quantum Tunneling of Magnetization in Dysprosium Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets via Orientation of the Anilato Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bridging ligand orientation in a dinuclear Dy(III) complex provides different coordination geometry. The geometry with higher axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) around DyIII centre gives higher energy barrier (Ueff) than the low order symmetric geometry [triangular dodecahedron geometry (pseudo D2d)] due to the large difference in their transverse anisotropy.







Abstract
Tuning the bridging fashion of anilato ligand in dinuclear DyIII complexes, reveals a sizable effect on the slow relaxation of magnetization. Combined experimental and theoretical studies divulge that the geometry with high order axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) reduces the transverse crystal fields corresponding to QTM (quantum tunneling of magnetization) resulting in a significant increase in energy barrier (Ueff=518&#8197;cm&#8722;1) through the Orbach relaxation process whereas the geometry with lower symmetry (triangular dodecahedron, pseudo D2d) enhances the transverse crystal fields that accelerate the ground state QTM process. Notably, the value 518&#8197;cm&#8722;1 represents the highest energy barrier among anilato ligand based SMMs.

         <title>Differently N&#8208;Capped Analogues of Fmoc&#8208;FF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues were collected and analyzed in their morphological, mechanical, and functional features, highlighting the effects caused by the Fmoc&#8208; modification.







Abstract
Short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been recently envisioned as excellent building blocks for the formulation of hydrogels with appealing properties. Due to its simplicity and capability to gel under physiological conditions, Fmoc&#8208;FF (N&#945;&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;diphenylalanine), remains one of the most studied low molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators. Since its first identification in 2006, a plethora of its analogues were synthetized and investigated for the fabrication of novel supramolecular materials. Here we report a description of the Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues in which the aromatic Fmoc group is replaced with other substituents. These analogues are distinguished into five different classes including derivatives: i) customized with solid phase peptide synthesis protecting groups; ii) containing non&#8208;aromatic groups, iii) containing aromatic groups, iv) derivatized with metal complexes and v) containing stimuli&#8208;responsive groups. The morphological, mechanical, and functional effects caused by this modification on the resulting material are also pointed out.

Putting a green spin on [7]TH: Fluorination of the tetrathia[7]helicene backbone disclosed important functionalization&#8208;related structure&#8208;electronic alterations crucial in the design of novel chiral derivatives. [7]THs also show brilliant green phosphorescence resulting from enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) due to an S&#8208;atom effect and distortion annulation.







Abstract
Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial beacuse most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine&#8208;containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes, highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared in high yields through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550&#8197;nm, and the studies suggest an efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet nonplanar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements, while DFT calculations enable a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations to be defined.

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform mechanochemical method for the partial reduction of TiO2 and Nb2O5 to the corresponding black oxides using NaH and LiH as reducing agents was developed. As shown by EPR spectroscopy, unpaired electrons were generated, and the obtained oxides exhibit better photocatalytic activity than the pristine oxides.







Abstract
Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. This study reports the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ into the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.

         <title>A Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8722;H Olefination Strategy and Its Application Towards Global Proteome Profiling of &#916;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that empowers activity&#8208;based proteome profiling of &#916;8&#8208;THC, a psychoactive natural product from Cannabis sativa, through a late&#8208;stage arene olefination method is described. This olefination method is capable of converting non&#8208;covalent acting compounds, such as &#916;8&#8208;THC, into activity&#8208;based probes after silyl deprotection. Its ability to interrogate protein interaction landscape of &#916;8&#8208;THC is then compared with AfBPP.







Abstract
Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such reliance on innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture restricted its applications to covalent acting compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8722;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H olefination with an arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#916;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4&#8201;db, a &#916;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with AfBP 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#916;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8722;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the synthesis, characterization and basic physiochemical properties of two novel heteroatom&#8208;doped PAHs (BTF and BTT). The studies on their singlet fission (SF) show that the efficiency of BTT is higher than that of BTF by two times while the triplet generation time of BTT becomes slower compared with BTF, indicating that the introduction of sulfur atom has a significant influence on the SF process.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8211;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2&#8197;times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.

         <dc:description>The development of molecule&#8208;based multifunctional switchable materials, exhibiting a switch of polarity and dielectric property, are extremely limited. Herein, we demonstrated solvent&#8208;vapour&#8208;induced reversible molecular rearrangements between non&#8208;polar crystals [Al(sap)(acac)(sol)] (H2sap = 2&#8208;salicylideneaminophenol, acac = acetylacetonate, sol = MeOH (1), EtOH (2)) and polar crystal [Al(sap)(acac)(DMSO)] (3). This crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal structural transformation was accompanied by a switch of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric properties, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, reflecting the SHG&#8208;active polar Cc space group of 3. This is the first reported example of dielectric properties and polarity switching in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit the strong green emission in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective two&#8208;step formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of H2O to diastereomeric mixtures of olefins. Our approach relies on the highly enantioselective syn&#8208;specific Shi&#8208;epoxidation of both olefin isomers and a stereoconverging epoxide hydrosilylation featuring a directional isomerization step via a configurationally labile radical intermediate that is reduced by a syn&#8208;selective intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer from a Ti&#8211;H bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Sidechain&#8208;Backbone Tetrel Bonding Interactions Provide a General Mechanism for trans&#8208;Peptoid Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amide bonds impedes de novo design of folded peptoids (poly&#8208;N&#8208;substituted glycines) with precise secondary structures and affects peptoid&#8208;biomolecule binding affinity. Herein, from X&#8208;ray, NMR and DFT studies of azapeptoids, we have discovered a tetrel bonding interaction that stabilizes trans&#8208;peptoids. We show that peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain adopt trans&#8208;amide geometries due to the presence of a nX/&#960;Ar &#8594; &#963;*C&#945;&#8210;N tetrel bonding interaction between the sidechain &#945;&#8208;heteroatom lone pair (nX) or &#960;&#8208;electrons (&#960;Ar) and the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8210;N bond. Further, CD spectroscopic studies of oligo&#8208;proline host&#8208;guest model peptides showed that azapeptoid residues stabilize polyproline II helical conformation. These data indicate that the sidechain&#8208;backbone tetrel bonding could be leveraged to design peptoids with precise secondary structures for a wide range of biological and material applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyst C70 was introduced for the facile construction of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines under mild conditions, yielding a diverse library of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Low catalyst loading, gram scale synthesis, and broad substrate scope (48 examples) demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol and encourage its future application as a photoredox catalyst in organic transformations.







Abstract
Herein, fullerene (C70) is introduced as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#934;&#9653;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical by energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism. The superoxide radical acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process. Azomethine ylide further participates in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Modifications of acyl carrier protein&#8208;bound glycosylated polyketides in pactamycin biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol&#8208;containing natural product produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum. Recent studies showed that the aminocyclopentitol unit is derived from N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine, which is attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound polyketide by a glycosyltransferase enzyme, PtmJ. Here, we report a series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications of the sugar moiety of the glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. In vitro reconstitution of PtmS (an AMP&#8208;ligase), PtmI (an ACP), PtmJ, PtmN (an oxidoreductase), PtmA (an aminotransferase), and PtmB (a putative carbamoyltransferase) showed that the N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine moiety of the glycosylated polyketide is first oxidized by PtmN and then transaminated by PtmA to give ACP&#8208;bound 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl polyketide. The amino group is then coupled with carbamoyl phosphate by PtmB to give a urea functionality. We also show that PtmG is a deacetylase that hydrolyses the C&#8208;2 N&#8208;acetyl group to give a free amine.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Yellow Arsenic towards Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbenes (CAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were reacted with yellow arsenic. Several products [(CAAC&#8208;n)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;As2)] (n = 1 (1), 4 (2)), [(CAAC&#8208;2)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;As4)] (3) and [(CAAC3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208; As8)] (6) were isolated due to the differing steric properties of CAAC&#8208;1&#8208;4. The products contain As2, As4 or As8 units and represent the first examples of CAACs&#8208;substituted products of yellow arsenic. The reactivity of As4 was compared with the reactivities of P4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, which led to a series of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives such as ([(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;P4)] (4) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8)] (7)) and the [(CAAC3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;AsP3)] (5). The products were characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods and DFT computations were performed to clarify their formation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Esterase specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Esterases enzymes regulate the body&#8217;s homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase's active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe,&#160;PM&#8208;OAc,&#160;to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH~ 8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM&#8208;OAc)&#160;binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image&#8208;based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.</dc:description>

Fluorescent image-based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Heterobiaryls through Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral heterobiaryls have wide applications in chiral ligands, catalysts, and bioactive compounds, which have aroused great interest in the chemistry community. This review provides a summary of the recent atroposelective synthesis strategies of heterobiaryls via ring&#8208;formation approaches involving transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which have aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic heterobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarize the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through ring formation approaches, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also discussed.

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin (FePEG5kTPP) formed an 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with a face&#8208;to&#8208;face cyclodextrin dimer in aqueous solution. The O2 adduct of the ferrous complex shows similar O2 binding affinity with natural hemoglobin and a long circulation time in blood, leading to the simple supramolecular complex that can be used as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur is described. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is much greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.

         <title>Fine Tuning of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts for the Synthesis of Tropane Alkaloid Skeletons
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell quantum dots proved to be efficient photocatalysts for a two steps [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons, whereas InP&#8208;ZnS quantum dots stopped after the first step, affording a clean allylation reaction.







Abstract
Several types of Quantum Dots (QDs) (CdS, CdSe and InP, as well as core&#8208;shell QDs such as type I InP&#8208;ZnS, quasi type&#8208;II CdSe&#8208;CdS and inverted type&#8208;I CdS&#8208;CdSe) were considered for generating &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl free radicals. The feasibility of the oxidation of the N&#8208;aryl amines and the generation of the desired radical was evidenced experimentally by quenching of the photoluminescence of the QDs and by testing a vinylation reaction using an alkenylsulfone radical trap. The QDs were tested in a radical [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons and that requires the completion of two consecutive catalytic cycles. Several QDs such as CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell proved to be efficient photocatalysts for this reaction. Interestingly, the addition of a second shorter chain ligand to the QDs appeared to be essential to complete the second catalytic cycle and to obtain the desired bicyclic tropane derivatives. Finally, the scope of the [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction was explored for the best performing QDs and isolated yields that compare well with classical iridium photocatalysis were obtained.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational Screening of New Candidate Reactions with High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of a QM&#8208;augmented&#8208;GNN, trained on a recently generated computational dataset, a vast chemical space of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions is screened for bioorthogonal potential, i.&#8201;e., a balance between speed and selectivity. A broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity is identified as a potential starting point for future experimental development of new bioorthogonal click reactions.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05&#8201;% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within &#8764;2&#8211;3&#8197;kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.

         <title>Factors Influencing the Chemoselectivity of Pd(OAc)2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Reactions Involving 1,6&#8208;Enynes as a Substrate and PhI(OAc)2 as a Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions.







Abstract
It is well documented in the literature that 1,6&#8208;enynes are cyclized using PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst to yield cyclopropyl ketones. In contrast, it has been reported that when 1,6&#8208;enynes are substituted by a hydroxy group at the &#945;&#8208;position to the alkyne, the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction is altered, and polycyclic oxa&#8208;heterocycles are formed. This suggests that the hydroxy substituent plays a crucial role in changing the mechanism of the reaction. The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06&#8208;D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations. This study demonstrates that the electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions. In addition, it was found that (1) the hypervalent iodine reagent PIDA serves not only as an oxidant for the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), but also as a nucleophile that drives the acetoxypalladation step of the reaction, (2) the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) by the iodonium ion [PhIOAc]+ occurs via an interesting mechanism involving coordination of [PhIOAc]+ to the Pd(II) centre, followed by a twist in the hypervalent iodine, and (3) Pd &#960;&#8208;complexes are not very susceptible to oxidation. (4) A Pd(II) complex can be six coordinate if the Pd centre is partially oxidized.

The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06-D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6-31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations. This study demonstrates that the electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;-philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions. In addition, it was found that (1) the hypervalent iodine reagent PIDA serves not only as an oxidant for the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), but also as a nucleophile that drives the acetoxypalladation step of the reaction, (2) the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) by the iodonium ion [PhIOAc]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; occurs via an interesting mechanism involving coordination of [PhIOAc]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the Pd(II) centre, followed by a twist in the hypervalent iodine, and (3) Pd &#960;-complexes are not very susceptible to oxidation. (4) A Pd(II) complex can be six coordinate if the Pd centre is partially oxidized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Solid&#8208;State Na&#8208;Ion Conductor for Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy hexagonal&#8208;prismatic Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was successfully synthesized with a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. It demonstrates an excellent electrochemical stability and a superior compatibility with sodium. Solid&#8208;state batteries based on this material deliver almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) hold great promise for their merits in low&#8208;cost, high energy density, and safety. However, developing solid electrolyte (SE) materials for SSBs with high performance is still a great challenge. In this study, high&#8208;entropy Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was synthesized at comparatively low sintering temperature of 950&#8201;&#176;C with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. More importantly, the Na symmetric cells using high&#8208;entropy SE show a high critical current density of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outstanding rate performance with fairly flat potential profiles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and steady cycling over 700&#8197;h under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Na3V2(PO4)3||high&#8208;entropy SE||Na batteries are further assembled manifesting a desirable cycling stability with almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles and high Columbic efficiency over 99.9&#8201;%. The findings present opportunities for the design of high&#8208;entropy Na&#8208;ion conductors toward the development of SSBs.

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphonium functionalization of a conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) with a stilbene core improved its spectrum of activity to include ESKAPE pathogens and mycobacteria while crucially retaining the membrane&#8208;perturbing mode of action characteristic of COEs. The efficacy of the lead compound in&#8197;vivo highlights the potential of the COE molecular platform for designing more effective antibiotics.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis enables an oxygen&#8208;sensitive energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalysed [2+2] photocycloaddition in water and under aerobic conditions. Micellar effects suppress undesired quenching of triplet states by molecular oxygen through low oxygen solubility and compartmentalization of the micellar reaction mixture. Additionally, activation of the substrates towards sensitization by hydrogen bonding in the Stern layer is proposed, allowing efficient triplet energy transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]2+.







Abstract
Micellar photocatalysis has been used to overcome oxygen quenching and enable a [2+2] photocycloaddition through triplet&#8208;energy transfer in water under aerobic conditions. The cheap and commercially available self&#8208;assembling sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were found to increase the oxygen tolerance of a typically oxygen&#8208;sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the use of the micellar solution was found to activate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds to energy transfer and allow [2+2] photocycloadditions to take place. Our preliminary studies of micellar effects on energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;based reactions demonstrate the reaction between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes in a mixture of SDS, water and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2.

Deracemization of a solid solution: The deracemization of a racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming system by using the possibility of syncrystallization, that is the formation of solid solution, with a chemically related conglomerate&#8208;forming system has been demonstrated. Based on phase diagram study, three model compounds crystallizing as racemic compounds were deracemized this way giving the evidence of the concept.







Abstract
Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror&#8208;related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence for this possibility is given in three examples by using temperature&#8208;cycling&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>Residue&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Sulfenylation Enabled by Acid&#8208;Activated S&#8208;Acetamidomethyl Cysteine Sulfoxide with Application to One&#8208;Pot Stapling and Lipidation Sequence</title>

Acid test for Tyr and Trp: S&#8208;Acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) enables the residue&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfenylation of Tyr or Trp under appropriately selected acidic reaction conditions. The dicationic intermediate derived from the Cys(Acm)(O) selectively reacts with Tyr, whereas the S&#8208;chlorocysteine allows Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation. The one&#8208;pot sequence of stapling and lipidation of peptides was achieved.







Abstract
A tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208; or tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides 1 in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acid test for Tyr and Trp&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) enables the residue-selective C&#8722;H sulfenylation of Tyr or Trp under appropriately selected acidic reaction conditions. The dicationic intermediate derived from the Cys(Acm)(O) selectively reacts with Tyr, whereas the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-chlorocysteine allows Trp-selective sulfenylation. The one-pot sequence of stapling and lipidation of peptides was achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tyrosine (Tyr)- or tryptophan (Trp)-selective metal-free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid-activated &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys-Tyr-linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys-Trp-linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr- and Trp-selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys-Tyr stapling and Trp lipidation of glucagon-like peptides &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in a one-pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital- and charge-controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range, satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties was fabricated by using anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode. The H2O molecules in the organohydrogel are fixed in the 3D polyacrylamide network through the hydrogen bond interaction of ethylene glycol and ionic hydration of LiCl, thus greatly limiting their crystallization or evaporation at extreme temperatures. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300123).

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical assay for probing the cleavage of surface&#8208;confined APP peptide substrates by BACE1 was developed based on specific chemical labeling of terminal tyrosine.







Abstract
Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite is modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag (ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is captured in microplate surface by the conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode (SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1 to 200&#8197;pM with a detection limit of 0.8&#8197;pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.

         <dc:description>
The energy storage cycle of the molecular solar thermal (MOST) system has been investigated. In particular, upon irradiation, the energy&#8208;lean 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene is converted into its energy&#8208;rich quadricyclane isomer. The energy&#8208;releasing back reaction can be triggered thermally by means of a suitable catalyst surface. The differences in the energy landscapes is visualized by sea level and mountains. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Papp and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203739). Cover design by F. Hemauer.

Novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been constructed by rational structural hybridization of cyanine and borondifluoride curcuminoid. The peculiar asymmetrical layout of the three key fragments endows these long&#8208;wavelength dyes with ideal photophysical properties and ER self&#8208;targeting capability. The photoluminescent mechanism, revealed by quantum chemical calculations, will greatly facilitate future exploration of cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized NIR dyes.

         <title>Organophosphorus Extractants: A Critical Choice for Actinides/Lanthanides Separation in Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of actinides from lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is a vital step of nuclear fuel cycle process. As one class of mature industrial extractants, the organophosphorus extractants have been widely used for the extraction and separation of actinides and lanthanides in spent fuel reprocessing due to their strong extraction ability and low&#8208;cost acquisition. In this concept, the application scope of tributyl phosphate (TBP), bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP), octyl(phenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO), trialkyl phosphine oxide (TRPO), and purified Cyanex 301 (bis(2,4,4&#8208;trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid, HA301) are introduced, and their extraction mechanism, as well as structure&#8208;function relationships for separation of actinides over lanthanides are also discussed. Furthermore, the design criteria, extraction properties and mechanism of several typical newly developed organophosphorus extractants (CMPO&#8208;modified calixarene/pillarene, phenanthroline&#8208;derived organophosphorus extractants, and phosphate&#8208;modified carborane) based on pre&#8208;organized skeletons are briefly reviewed. Finally, we summarize and emphasize the important role played by those organophosphorus extractants and look forward to their potential applications in separation of actinides over lanthanides in future advanced nuclear fuel cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>From chemotherapy to phototherapy &#8208; changing the therapeutic action of a metallo&#8208;intercalating RuII&#8208;ReI luminescent system by switching its sub&#8208;cellular location.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a new heterodinuclear ReIRuII metallointercalator containing RuII(dppz) and ReI(dppn) moieties is reported. Cell&#8208;free studies reveal that the complex has similar photophysical properties to its homoleptic M(dppz) analogue and it also binds to DNA with a similar affinity. However, the newly reported complex has very different in&#8208;cell properties to its parent. In complete contrast to the homoleptic system, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex is not intrinsically cytotoxic but displays appreciable phototoxic, despite both complexes displaying very similar quantum yields for singlet oxygen sensitization. Optical microscopy suggests that the reason for these contrasting biological effects is that whereas the homoleptic complex localises in the nuclei of cells, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex preferentially accumulates in mitochondria. These observations illustrate how even small structural changes in metal based therapeutic leads can modulate their mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretching the Bisalkyne Raman Spectral Palette Reveals a New Electrophilic Covalent Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small heteroaryl&#8208;diyne (Het&#8208;DY) tags with distinct vibrational frequencies, and physiologically relevant cLog P were designed for multiplexed bioorthogonal Raman imaging. Pd&#8208;Cu catalyzed coupling, combined with the use of Lei ligand, was shown to improve overall yields of the desired heterocoupled Het&#8208;Dy tags, minimizing the production of homocoupled side&#8208;products. Spectral data were in agreement with the trends predicted by DFT calculations and systematic introduction of electron&#8208;rich/poor rings stretched the frequency limit of aryl&#8208;capped diynes (2209&#8208;2243 cm&#8208;1). The improved Log P of these Het&#8208;Dy tags was evident from their diffuse distribution in cellular uptake studies and functionalizing tags with organelle markers allowed the acquisition of location&#8208;specific biological images. LC&#8208;MS&#8208; and NMR&#8208;based assays showed that some heteroaryl&#8208;capped internal alkynes are potential nucleophile traps with structure&#8208;dependent reactivity. These biocompatible Het&#8208;Dy tags, equipped with covalent reactivity, open up new avenues for Raman bioorthogonal imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#181;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X = CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn = CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2 M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depend on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8208;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et &#8594; CH2Ph replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination vs. Insertion: On the Interaction of 5d&#8208;Transition Metal Carbonyl Clusters with Silver(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The title silver(I) complex salts [Ag{Re2(CO)10}{Re(CO)5}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgRe4; ORF = &#8208;OC(CF3)3) and [Ag{Ir4(CO)12}2]+&#173;[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgIr8) form upon reaction of Ag+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and the transition metal carbonyls (TMCs) Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 respectively. The solid&#8208;state structure of the AgRe4 cluster shows an unexpected asymmetric coordination motif, wherein the silver(I) cation has inserted into the Re&#8208;Re bond of one Re2(CO)10 moiety, while the other dirhenium carbonyl coordinates only over one metal atom towards the silver(I) cation. The AgIr8 cluster is formed by the edge&#8208;on coordination of two Ir4 tetrahedra and the silver cation in a D2 symmetric fashion with a torsion angle of 46.5&#176;. The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths between the silver atom and the nearby metal atoms in all cases, whereas only the non&#8208;inserted Re2(CO)10 moiety shows additional bond paths between the carbonyl ligands and the silver cation. In addition, the insertion of the Ag+ cation into the Re&#8208;Re bond in Re2(CO)10 removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered TMC donors W(CO)6 &lt; Re2(CO)10 &lt; Os3(CO)12 &lt; Ir4(CO)12. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;&#8208;donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag+&#8592;[TMC].</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Light&#8208;mediated Protocol for the Direct Amide Bond Formation via a Novel Carboxylic Acid Photoactivation Mode by Pyridine&#8211;CBr4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct amide bond formation between a carboxylic acid and an amine still constitutes a challenging reaction for both academia and industry. We demonstrate herein that several pairs of amines (halogen bond acceptors) and organohalogen sources may be used for the photochemical amidation reaction under either UVA or sunlight irradiation. Our studies led to the identification of pyridine&#8211;CBr4 as an efficient agent to perform synthesis of amides under LED 370 nm irradiation, avoiding super&#8208;stoichiometric quantities. An extended substrate scope was demonstrated, showing that the widely used amino and carboxyl protecting groups are compatible with this photochemical protocol, while a number of industrially interesting products and bioactive compounds were synthesized. Direct infusion&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry studies suggest an unprecedented type of carboxylic acid activation mode upon irradiation, involving the generation of a symmetric anhydride, an active ester with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and a mixed anhydride with hypobromous acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Screening of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial for renewable energy technologies. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) methods and microkinetic simulations, we systematically investigated the ORR catalytic performance of a series of 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks M3(HADQ)2 (HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline). It shows that all 2D M3(HADQ)2 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh and Pd) monolayers are metallic, due to &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystal orbitals centered on the central metals and ligand N atoms. The catalytic activity of M3(HADQ)2 depends on the binding strength between ORR intermediates and metal species, and can be tuned via changing the central metals. Among these candidates, Rh3(HADQ)2 and Co3(HADQ)2 show superior ORR performance to Pt (111) with high half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.99 and 0.93 V, respectively. Moreover, the screened two catalysts have excellent intermediate&#8208;tolerance ability for dynamic coverage of oxygenated species on the active sites. Our work provides a new path towards developing efficient ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of the Reaction of Elemental Sulfur and Polysulfides with Cyanide and Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of elemental sulfur (S8) and polysulfides with nucleophiles are relevant to organic synthesis, materials science and biochemistry, but the mechanisms by which they operate are still unknown due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // &#969;B97X&#8208;D/ aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, we studied the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. All plausible pathways including nucleophilic decomposition, unimolecular decomposition, scrambling reactions, and attack on thiosulfoxides, have been considered to provide the first comprehensive mechanistic picture for this class of reactions. Overall, intramolecular cyclization is identified as the most favorable decomposition pathway for long polysulfides. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition, nucleophilic attack, and scrambling pathways can be expected.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Atropisomeric&#8208;NHC Catechodithiolate Ruthenium Complexes for Z&#8208;Selective Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Cross Metathesis of Exo&#8208;Norbornenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of 16&#8201;chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable NHCs was synthesized in good yields with excellent enantiomeric purities (up &gt;99.75&#8201;:&#8201;0.25&#8197;er). The chiral BIAN&#8208;based Ru&#8208;complexes Ru&#8208;4&#8201;g was the most efficient to catalyse the AROCM of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;norbornenes (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Successfully converted into its corresponding Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex Z&#8208;Ru&#8208;5, the latter demonstrated high efficiency in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes in &gt;98&#8201;% Z&#8208;selectivity and the highest enantioselectivities reported so far (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).







Abstract
A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral atropBIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).

         <title>Correlation of Experimental and Calculated Reaction Enthalpies with Ligand Donor Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calorimetric studies on the formation of [(YPhos)AuCl] complexes confirmed the high binding strength of these ligands. The reaction enthalpies are shown to be easily obtained by calculations and correlate with the phosphine donor properties thus representing an interesting problem&#8208;specific descriptor for ligands in gold catalysis.







Abstract
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) have recently proven to be strongly donating ligands that enable high catalyst activities in gold(I)&#8208;mediated transformations. We now report on a calorimetric study dealing with the [Au(YPhos)Cl] system and assess YPhos&#8208;Au bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy&#8208;to&#8208;obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis and Characterization of Indenone Azine&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Accepting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be more accepting: Indenone azines, in which two indene units are cross&#8208;conjugated by an exocyclic azine (C=N&#8722;N=C) moiety, have been synthesized in a stereocontrolled manner. The azine moiety makes indenone azines planar structure and gives enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character, thus making them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks.







Abstract
Indenone azines, in which the exocyclic C=C bond in dibenzopentafulvalene is replaced by an azine moiety (C=N&#8722;N=C), have been synthesized as novel electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds. Structural modulation at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions of indenone azines enabled stereoselective syntheses of diastereomers in which the configurations of the two C=N bonds are E,E or Z,Z. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that all the indenone azines exhibit high coplanarity in contrast to the twisted frameworks of dibenzopentafulvalene derivatives, resulting in the formation of densely &#960;&#8208;stacked structures. Electrochemical measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed the electron&#8208;accepting character of indenone azines comparable to isoindigo dyes. In particular, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives impart enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and significantly red&#8208;shifted photoabsorption. This study demonstrates that indenone azines represent a promising candidate as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks for optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Copper Activation Enabling Reversible Aqueous Cu&#8722;ZnS Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries have been proposed: ZnS is gradually activated by copper to form CuS under electric field during cycling. The formed CuS undergoes a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S for energy storage. The introduction of sphalerite activation in the field of mining and metallurgy provides an idea for the design of materials design for aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries (AMSBs) have attracted research interest due to their high capacity, environmentally friendly qualities, and the accessibility of raw materials. However, the design strategies for metal&#8208;sulfide cathode have rarely been reported. Here, the copper&#8208;activated sphalerite in which Zn2+ is substituted by Cu2+ through ion exchange has been introduced for the first time as cathode for aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries. After sphalerite transformed to CuS, a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S storage mechanism has been proposed. At 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density, the capacity can reach 532.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. When cycled once at a current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial reversible capacity can reach 461&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the assembled Zn//ZnS hybrid ion cell delivers an energy of up to 460&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is better than for many AMSBs.

         <title>Interface Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells through Potassium Citrate Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of potassium citrate (PC) passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficiency and stability are key factors determining the final cost of electricity that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generate. To date, effective strategy to progress in achieving efficient and stable PSCs is still a difficult problem that researchers continue to explore. This study reports a useful way to improve the quality of SnO2 film by introducing potassium citrate (PC) into SnO2 nanoparticles solution. PC passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2. The resultant photovoltaic (PV) device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.79&#8201;%. The introduction of PC interface also significantly suppress the degradation of PSCs, by which 87.6&#8201;% of initial PCE is maintained after 2850&#8197;h storage in ambient environment. Moreover, the devices retained 95.5&#8201;% of initial PCE under 1&#8208;sun continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

&#8220;This study tests the hypothesis that local interactions in the non&#8208;heme FeII centers of PHF8 and EFE control the differences in dioxygen and 2OG binding modes to generate off&#8208;line or in&#8208;line FeIII&#8722;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediates.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202300138).
