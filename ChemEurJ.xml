         <title>The Coordination Behavior of the Tellurium Incorporated Mercuraazametallamacrocycle and Investigation of d10&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d10&#160;Interactions between Closed Shell (Ag+&#160;Hg2+) Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv of AgOTf (OTf = trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;Arylation of Backbone Amides as a Novel Tool for Conformational Modification in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;aryl amide bonds for peptide conformation: In the universe of peptides,theN&#8208;aryl amide bond, with its large steric and electronic effects and ability to restrain amide bond rotation, is represented as a new star. By employing N&#8208;arylation as a backbone amide modification strategy in peptides, we could unravel the different worlds of distinct and predominantly homogeneous conformations in cyclic hexa&#8208; and cyclic pentapeptides containing one or two N&#8208;aryl amide bonds. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Dangi and U. Kiran&#8197;Marelli (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300753).

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Stabilized Liquid Crystal Films Containing Dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;Based Chiral Photoswitch: Multi&#8208;Modulation for Environment&#8208;Adaptative Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is constructed by a dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch. The smart window can be automatically transformed from initial transparent state to light scattering state with the changes of external ambient conditions, and can be manually switched between the opaque state and transparent state through a low electric field, which greatly satisfies the diverse requirements for daily life.







Abstract
A polymer&#8208;stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC)&#8208;based environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is demonstrated. This PSLC system contains a right&#8208;handed dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch and a chiral dopant, S811, with opposite handedness, of which the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the switch can drive self&#8208;shading of the smart window under UV light stimulus because of the transition from nematic phase to cholesteric one. With the assistance of solar heat, the opacity of the smart window can be deepened because the heat promotes the isomerization conversion rate of the switch. This switch has no thermal relaxation at room temperature, therefore, the smart window exhibits dual stabilization: transparent state (cis&#8208;isomer) and opaque state (trans&#8208;isomer). Moreover, the incident intensity of sunlight can be regulated by an electric field, which allows the smart window to adapt to some specific situations. Such an energy&#8208;saving device can be used in buildings and vehicles to control indoor temperature and adapt to the required ambiance.

         <title>Sulfonyl Diazaborine &#8216;Click&#8217; Chemistry Enables Rapid and Efficient Bioorthogonal Labeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we have systematically developed and deliberated an efficient bioorthogonal reaction via the rapid formation of sulfonyl&#8208;diazaborine. The conjugation is robust to demonstrate suitable application in cancer cell imaging and treatment.







Abstract
Finding an ideal bioorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for bioorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2&gt;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.

         <title>A Blueprint for Transforming Indigos to Photoresponsive Molecular Tools</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blue dye indigo has historically been isolated from the plant family Indigofera and widely applied in the denim industry for producing blue jeans. The advantageous photochemical properties of indigo and its derivatives have now attracted the attention of the scientific community for their use as molecular photoswitches. In their review Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300981), C.&#8208;Y. Huang and S. Hecht detail the synthetic approaches to preparing indigos and discuss indigos&#8217; applications as photoresponsive molecular tools.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of the hoop size on the electronic and charge transport properties of [5]&#8208; and [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazoles is reported. In these examples, a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules into thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Poriel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300934).

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. The interconversion of a macrocyclic triboronic acid (blue Japanese umbrella) and a tricyclic boroxine (green pinwheel) can be triggered by water or temperature. These unique interconversions are attributed to the entropic advantage of intramolecular boroxine formation. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Ono and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300995).

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Stachyurin and Casuarinin Focusing on C&#8208;Glycosidic Bond Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin, focusing on the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilization of their beneficial bioactivities.







Abstract
Stachyurin and casuarinin are ellagitannins, a class of polyphenols that exhibit various biological activities that have an impact on human health. Casuarinin is a stachyurin stereoisomer. These compounds contain the characteristic C&#8208;glycosidic bond between the open&#8208;chain d&#8208;glucose and the phenol aromatic ring. Therefore, chemical elucidation of the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity is required to exploit their multiple bioactivities. This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin via the &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8208;glycosylation as well as the &#946;&#8208;selective introduction of the oxygen functional group, focusing on structural specificity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilisation of their beneficial bioactivities.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent and predominantly localized boron radical has been synthesized by the single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D analogue of an NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation. The steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(o&#8208;carborane) backbone and the almost perpendicular orientation of the NHC ligand give rise to the distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Ye and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301270).

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework derived Cu&#8208;Ag interface for selective carbon monoxide electroreduction to acetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) is a potential way to obtain high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, achieving high selectivity to acetate is still a challenge. Herein, we develop a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;modified Cu metal&#8208;organic framework (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) that demonstrates Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products up to 90.4% at 200 mA cm&#8208;2 and an acetate FE of 61.1% with a partial current density of 122.2 mA cm&#8208;2. Detailed investigations show that the introduction of Ag on CuMOF&#8208;74 favors the generation of abundant Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirms that these Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites improve the coverage of *CO and *CHO and the coupling between each other and stabilize key intermediates *OCCHO and *OCCH2, thus significantly promoting to the acetate selectivity on Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74. This work provides a high&#8208;efficiency pathway for CORR to C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Design of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) having efficient ISC which is proportional to their twisting angle. But difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT applications. Boron containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for outstanding optical properties. But planar BODIPY dyes have&#160;low ISC and thus they are also not very effective as PDT agents. Herein, we designed BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene fused dyes, BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene&#160;with red shifted absorbances. All dyes have helical structures and their twisting angles are increased by substitutions at boron&#8208;center. The new dyes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances their ISC rate which is responsible for high singlet oxygen generation. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated and one of the dyes showed efficient cancer cell killing on photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Factor Beyond Schmidt's Criteria That Impact the Photo&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity and Photoactuation of Molecular Crystals Based on Cyclic Chalcone Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclic chalcone analogues of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (BIO), (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (NIO), (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BFO), and (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BTO) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+2] cycloaddition did not occur in&#160;&#160;BIO and BTO. Single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surfaces analyses revealed that there were interactions of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (CH2) existed between adjacent molecules in BIO. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2+2] cycloaddition. In BTO, similar interactions of Cl&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;S and C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (C6H4) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H only exists around the carbonyl group in BFO and NIO, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2+2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle&#8208;like crystals of BFO and NIO displayed evident photo&#8208;induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon&#8208;carbon double bond would affect the [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt&#8217;s criteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation of Fluorometric Protease Assays: 7&#8208;Nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;Amides) as Class&#8208;Spanning Protease Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50 years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Here, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8211;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;shell State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most redox systems generally cannot avoid the involvement of open&#8208;shell species upon generating multiply charged species, which often reduces reversibility in multi&#8208;color electrochromic systems. In this study, we newly synthesized octakis(aminophenyl)substituted pentacenebisquinodimethane (BQD) derivatives and their hybrids with alkoxyphenyl analogues. Thanks to apparent twoelectron transfer accompanied by double dramatic changes in the structure of the arylated quinodimethane skeleton, the dicationic and tetracationic states were generated and isolated quantitatively because of the negligible steady&#8208;state concentration of intermediary open&#8208;shell species such as monocation or trication radicals. When two electrophores with different donating abilities are attached to the BQD skeleton, a dicationic state with a different color can be isolated in addition to the neutral and tetracationic states. For the latter of these, an interchromophore interaction induces a red&#8208;shift of the NIR absorptions, thus realizing tricolor UV/Vis/NIR electrochromic behavior involving only closed&#8208;shell states.</dc:description>

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention. Chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the immobilization of copper&#8208;containing NiR from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised MWCNT electrodes. We demonstrate that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Switchable Electroactive Fluorophores Based on &#955;5&#8208;Biphosphinines
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines is reported. &#955;5&#8208;Biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. In situ formed radicals are studied. Electrofluorochromism experiments revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for applications as switchable materials.







Abstract
The synthesis and full characterization of a family of stable &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines connected in 4,4&#8208;position through a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridges is reported. The impact of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on the optical (absorption/emission) and redox properties was investigated using a joint experimental/theoretical approach. In contrast to the &#960;&#8208;extended ones, the &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two easily accessible and reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. The in&#8197;situ formed radical cations are studied by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and electron paramagnetic resonance. Finally, electrochemical modulation of fluorescence (electrofluorochromism) was performed and revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for further applications as switchable materials.

         <title>A Novel Nitridoborate Hydride Sr13[BN2]6H8 Elucidated from X&#8208;ray and Neutron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strontium nitridoborate hydride was prepared in a solid&#8208;state synthesis at 950&#8201;&#176;C and extends the little&#8208;known family of nitridoborate hydrides. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data. MAS&#8197;NMR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy support the structure model and the presence of anionic hydrogen. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the electronic structure.







Abstract
Metal hydrides are an uprising compound class bringing up various functional materials. Due to the low X&#8208;ray scattering power of hydrogen, neutron diffraction is often crucial to fully disclose the structural characteristics thereof. We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr13[BN2]6H8, formed in a solid&#8208;state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.&#8197;176), exhibiting a novel three&#8208;dimensional network of [BN2]3&#8722; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr13[BN2]6H8 expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.

         <title>Bora&#172;alkene s: Metal Coordination and Reactions with BH&#8208;boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized, &#8722;N=C=S substituted bora&#172;alkene was used as a &#960; ligand in transition metal complexes. Due to the C&#8208;nucleophilic nature of the bora&#172;alkene, it underwent regioselective hydroboration reactions with the boranes (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. The latter reaction showed a subsequent hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange.







Abstract
The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized bora&#172;alkene 1, conveniently prepared by a BH borenium/hydroboration route, forms stable copper, gold or palladium &#960;&#8208;complexes. The polar bora&#172;alkene B=C system undergoes regioselective hydroboration reactions with the (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 boranes. The latter reaction involves a subsequent rearrangement that leads to internal hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange at the borane pair.

Stapled peptides are a unique class of cyclic &#945;&#8208;helical peptides that are conformationally constrained via their amino acid side&#8208;chains. They have been transformative to the field of chemical biology and peptide drug discovery through addressing many of the physicochemical limitations of linear peptides. However, there are several issues with current chemical strategies to produce stapled peptides. For example, two distinct unnatural amino acids are required to synthesize i, i+7 alkene stapled peptides, leading to high production costs. Furthermore, low purified yields are obtained due to cis/trans isomers produced during ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclisation. Here we report the development of a new i, i+7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that addresses these issues. The asymmetric synthesis of nine unnatural Fmoc&#8208;protected alkyne&#8208;amino acids facilitated a systematic study to determine the optimal (S,S)&#8208;stereochemistry and 14&#8208;carbon diyne&#8208;girder bridge length. Diyne&#8208;girder stapled T&#8208;STAR peptide 29 was demonstrated to have excellent helicity, cell permeability and stability to protease degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the diyne&#8208;girder constraint is a Raman chromophore with potential use in Raman cell microscopy. Development of this highly effective, bifunctional diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy leads us to believe that it can be used to produce other stapled peptide probes and therapeutics.

         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; Photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by Aryldiazonium Salts and Arylazo Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photografting of azosulfates Ar&#8722;N=NSO3Na on gold, leads to bonded organic films. Au&#8722;R or Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;R bonding results from a stepwise or concerted reaction respectively. Azosulfonates are shelf stable compounds which are much easier to handle with respect to the commonaryldiazonium salt.







Abstract
Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8722;N=N&#8722;SO3Na) have been found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8722;Nsp2&#8722; and Au&#8722;Csp2&#8722; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8722;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy), and the bond dissociation energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8722;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layer films has been observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>From Framework to Layers Driven by Pressure &#8211; The Monophyllo&#8208;Oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and Comparison to its &#945;&#8208;Polymorph</title>

         <dc:description>
With the discovery of &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2:Eu2+, an oxonitridophosphate with outstanding luminescence properties is presented. Structural comparison of the &#945;&#8208;phase already known from the literature with other classes of compounds allowed a possible basic structure to be predicted, which was confirmed experimentally. This approach could be applied to other (oxo)nitridophosphates known in the literature, leading to the discovery of additional host lattices for possible luminescent properties.







Abstract
Oxonitridophosphates exhibit the potential for broad structural diversity, making them promising host&#8208;compounds in phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode applications. The novel monophyllo&#8208;oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 was obtained by using the high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique. The crystal structure was solved and refined based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmme (no. 67, a=8.8109(6), b=12.8096(6), c=4.9065(3) &#197;, Z=4) and has a structure related to that of Ba2CuSi2O7. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the phase transition from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and to confirm the latter as the corresponding high&#8208;pressure polymorph. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of Eu2+ doped samples of both polymorphs were investigated and discussed, showing blue and cyan emission, respectively (&#945;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=438&#8197;nm, fwhm=46&#8197;nm/2396&#8197;cm&#8722;1; &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=502&#8197;nm, fwhm=42&#8197;nm/1670&#8197;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Balanced Energy Gaps as a Key Design Rule for Solution&#8208;Phase Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence is very rare in all&#8208;organic emitters. Here we show how this property can emerge as a function of energy gaps between the phosphorescent state and higher energy charge&#8208;transfer states. An optimal gap of &#8764;0.4&#8197;eV yields efficient phosphorescence, with smaller gaps leading to thermally activated delayed fluorescence and larger gaps allowing triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation to dominate.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic emitters that display solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence (sRTP) remain exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate the structural and photophysical properties that support sRTP by comparing a recently reported sRTP compound (BTaz&#8722;Th&#8722;PXZ) to two novel analogous materials, replacing the donor group by either acridine or phenothiazine. The emissive triplet excited state remains fixed in all three cases, while the emissive charge&#8208;transfer singlet states (and the calculated paired charge&#8208;transfer T2 state) vary with the donor unit. While all three materials show dominant RTP in film, in solution different singlet&#8208;triplet and triplet&#8208;triplet energy gaps give rise to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation followed by weak sRTP for the new compounds, compared to dominant sRTP throughout for the original PXZ material. Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge&#8208;transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.

         <title>Insight into the Structural and Emissive Behavior of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Americium(III) Formate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the synthesis and characterization of a novel three&#8208;dimentional americium(III) formate coordination polymer, which features unique C3v site symmetry and atypical emission behavior. Rationalization of inner sphere bonding and unusual optical properties is supported by theoretical QTAIM and NLMO calculations.







Abstract
We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO2)3) crystals synthesized via the in&#8197;situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF).

     alt="Insight into the Structural and Emissive Behavior of a Three-Dimensional Americium(III) Formate Coordination Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported is the synthesis and characterization of a novel three-dimentional americium(III) formate coordination polymer, which features unique C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; site symmetry and atypical emission behavior. Rationalization of inner sphere bonding and unusual optical properties is supported by theoretical QTAIM and NLMO calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) crystals synthesized via the in&#8197;situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF). The coordination polymer features Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions linked by formate ligands into a three-dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.&#8201;g., Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). Structure determination revealed a nine-coordinate Am&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; metal center that features a unique local C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. The metal&#8211;ligand bonding interactions were investigated by vibrational spectroscopy, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results paint a predominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal-oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd&#8722;O&amp;lt;Eu&#8722;O&amp;lt;Am&#8722;O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Notably, the rarely reported &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;0&#8242;&lt;/sub&gt; emission band is observed and dominates the emission spectrum. This behavior is unusual and is attributed to the C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; coordination environment of the metal center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8208;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8208;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8208;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8208;x supports can be easily ameliorated via varying preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8208;x and highly&#8208;dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84%) at 80 oC. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8208;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400 mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid&#8208;like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR&#8208;based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8208;&#8208;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalyti Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Mechanically Interlocked Molecules to Recognize Anions and Cations: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions and cations develop several roles in nature. Thus, compounds capable to interact with ions show large relevancy. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) appear as potential candidates to perform efficient ionic recognition. Here, DFT calculations have been realized to elucidate and tune the MIM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) chemical bonds and compare them with the acyclic/cyclic molecular structures&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) interactions.







Abstract
Ions appear as active components in diverse materials. Here, the bonding energy between mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) or their acyclic/cyclic molecular derivatives and i) Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; ions and/or ii) Na+ and K+ ions, have been investigated. The chemical environment provided by MIMs is less preferably to recognize ionic species compared to unconstrained interactions that are furnished by acyclic molecules. However, MIMs can be more adequate structures for ionic recognition than cyclic compounds if a chemical arrangement of the bond sites that relevantly support more favorable interactions with ions compared to Pauli repulsive ambient is provided. The hydrogen replacement by electron donor (&#8722;NH2) or acceptor (&#8722;NO2) groups in MIMs favors the anion/cation recognition due to decreased Pauli repulsion energy and/or more attractive non&#8208;covalent bonds. This study clarifies the chemical environment provided by MIMs to interact with ions and highlights these molecules as relevant structures to realize ionic sensing.

         <title>Template&#8208;assisted Fabrication of O&#8208;doped CoP Microflowers with Optimal Electronic Modulation for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the O&#8208;doped CoP microflowers are synthesized via a self&#8208;sacrificial reactive template&#8208;engaged strategy. Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained sample with optimal electronic structure exhibits the excellent hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
Exploring efficient, affordable and stable electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great scientific significance for the practical implementation of the water splitting. The heteroatom doping represents a serviceable strategy to further elevate the catalytic performance for a transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst because of the electronic regulation effect. Herein, a reliable self&#8208;sacrificial template&#8208;engaged approach is proposed to synthesize O&#8208;doped CoP (denoted as O&#8208;CoP) microflowers, which simultaneously considers the regualtion of electronic configuration via anion doping and sufficient exposure of active sites via nanostructure engineering. The suitable O incorporation content in CoP matrix could tremendously modify the electronic configuration, accelerate the charge transfer, promote the exposure of active sites, strengthen the electrical conductivity, and adjust the adsorption state of H*. Consequently, the optimized O&#8208;CoP microflowers with optimal O concentration display a remarkable HER property with a small overpotential of 125&#8197;mV to afford a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 68&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term durability for 32&#8197;h under alkaline electrolyte, manifesting a considerable potential application for hydrogen production at large scale. The integration of anion incorporation and architecture engineering in this work will bring in a depth insight for the design of low&#8208;cost and effective electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Piezochromism and Conductivity Modulations under High Pressure by Manipulating the Viologen Radical Concentration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the  radical concentration to modulate the properties in solid multifunctional materials is an attractive topic in various frontier fields. Viologens have the unique redox capability to generate radical states through reversible electron transfer (ET) under external stimuli. Herein, taking the viologens as the model, two kinds of crystalline compounds with different molecule&#8208;conjugated systems were designed and synthesized. By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;X. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (R) of 1&#8208;NO3 decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high&#8208;radical&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;NO3remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular&#8208;based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity based on Dibenzodioxin Linkage: Design, Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades have established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and soluble nature of glassy polymers. Because of their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that can potentially find applications in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, majority of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, we discuss the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds, synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, we discuss the prospects of these materials with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, we analyze the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]&#8208;Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro-Diels-Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro-Diels-Alder product were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycle formation that relies upon trans metal coordination of appropriately placed pyridine ligands within an arylene ethynylene construct provides rapid and reliable access to molecular rotors encapsulated within the macrocyclic framework. Showing no significant close contacts to the central rotors, X&#8208;ray crystallography of Ag(I)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles provides plausibility for free rotation or wobbling of rotors within the central cavity. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR of Pd(II)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles supports the notion of unobstructed movement of simple arenes in the crystal lattice. Solution 1H NMR studies indicate complete and immediate macrocycle formation upon introduction of Pd(II) to the pyridyl&#8208;based ligand at room temperature. Moreover, the formed macrocycle is stable in solution; a lack of significant changes in the 1H NMR spectrum upon cooling to &#8208;50 &#176;C is consistent with the absence of dynamic behavior. The synthetic route to these macrocycles is expedient and modular, providing access to rather complex constructs in four simple steps involving Sonogashira coupling and deprotection reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Wearable Patches Using Light&#8208;Controlled Activation and Delivery of Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus while being ostensibly non&#8208;haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed (3+2) Cycloaddition for the Dearomatization of Electron&#8208;poor Arenes under Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8208;Guest Complexation to Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#8208;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Cancer is a global health problem and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here we first evaluated the thermodynamic and the kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings may have implications on clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and may affect the management of cancer patients.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Palladium Catalyst Transfer on Benzoheterodiazoles as Acceptor Monomers and Discovery of Catalyst Transfer Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with tBu3PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3 equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0 equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The curved &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface of bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene is multiply methylated to form exo&#8208;di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexamethylated corannulenes. The multimethylations have become possible by in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation sequences that involve the reduction of corannulenes using sodium to form the anionic corannulene species and the subsequent SN2 reaction of the anionic species with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, NMR, MS, UV&#8208;Vis measurements, and DFT calculations have revealed the molecular structures of the multi&#8208;methylated corannulenes and the sequence of the multi&#8208;methylation. This work has the potential to contribute to the controlled synthesis and characterizations of multi&#8208;functionalized fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;pair Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesised using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology.

         <title>External Flash Generation of Carbenoids Enables Monodeuteration of Dihalomethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, incorporation of one deuterium atom was achieved by H&#8722;D exchange of one of the two identical methylene protons in various dihalomethanes (halogen = Cl, Br, and I) through a rapid&#8208;mixing microflow reaction of lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base and deuterated methanol as a deuteration reagent. Generation of highly unstable carbenoid intermediate and suppression of its decomposition were successfully controlled under high flow&#8208;rate conditions. Monofunctionalization of diiodomethane afforded various building blocks composed of boryl, stannyl, and silyl groups. The monodeuterated diiodomethane, which served as a deuterated C1 source, was subsequently subjected to diverted functionalization methods to afford various products including biologically important molecules bearing isotope labelling at specific positions and homologation products with monodeuteration.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage technology due to their tempting high theoretical capacity and energy density. Nevertheless, the wastage of active materials that originates from the shuttling effect of polysulfides still hinders advancement of Li&#8208;S batteries. The effective design of cathode materials is extremely pivotal to solve this thorny problem. Herein, Surface engineering in covalent organic polymers (COPs) has been performed to investigate the influence of pore wall polarity on the performance of COP&#8208;based cathodes used for Li&#8208;S batteries. With the assistance of experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, performance improvement by increasing pore surface polarity and a synergy effect of the polarized functionalities, along with nano&#8208;confinement effect of the COPs, are disclosed, to which the improved performance of Li&#8208;S batteries including outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99.0%) and extremely low capacity decay (0.08% over 425 cycles at 1.0 C) is attributed. This work not only enlightens the designable synthesis and applications of covalent polymers as polar sulfur hosts with high utilization of active materials, but also provides a feasible guide for the design of effective cathode materials for future advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio&#8208;composed system was constructed by in situ encapsulation in mild conditions of formate dehydrogenase enzyme in the ZIF&#8208;8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF&#8208;8 in the enzyme&#8217;s operation media can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10 mg mL&#8208;1. The bio&#8208;friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst while the production of formic acid is improved 3.4&#8208;fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as a concentrator of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio&#8208;composed system retains 86 % of its activity after a long&#8208;time of 5 cycles, indicating an excellent magnetic recovery capacity and a good reusability.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides by C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8208;aryl glycosides synthesis through C&#8722;H functionalization does not require pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrate, and has high step economy and atomic economy. Therefore, from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes, this Concept article systematically summarizes the synthesis strategies of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with different positional selectivity.







Abstract
In recent years, the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides hrough C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted extensive attention of organic synthesis chemists due to its steps and atomic economy. In this concept, we systematically summarizes the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with diverse regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes. It can be found that a series of recently developed C&#8722;H glycosylation reactions have higher site&#8208;selectivity and diastereomeric selectivity than Friedel&#8211;Crafts glycosylation reaction. The reaction conditions are milder, which can be compatible with acid&#8208;sensitive protective groups, such as acetals or ketals, and the deprotection is more convenient. It can be seen that there are few reports on remote C&#8722;H glycosylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, which is a new field and needs further research. In addition, C&#8722;H glycosylation has a lot of shortcomings, which need to be further explored: a)&#8197;the precise regulation of stereoselectivity in the reaction process also needs further optimization; b)&#8197;the research on the reaction mechanism is almost limited to DFT calculation, and there is no exact experimental evidence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-aryl glycosides synthesis&lt;/b&gt; through C&#8722;H functionalization does not require pre-functionalization of the substrate, and has high step economy and atomic economy. Therefore, from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes, this Concept article systematically summarizes the synthesis strategies of C-aryl glycosides with different positional selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the synthesis of C-aryl glycosides hrough C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted extensive attention of organic synthesis chemists due to its steps and atomic economy. In this concept, we systematically summarizes the synthesis of C-aryl glycosides with diverse regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes. It can be found that a series of recently developed C&#8722;H glycosylation reactions have higher site-selectivity and diastereomeric selectivity than Friedel&#8211;Crafts glycosylation reaction. The reaction conditions are milder, which can be compatible with acid-sensitive protective groups, such as acetals or ketals, and the deprotection is more convenient. It can be seen that there are few reports on remote C&#8722;H glycosylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, which is a new field and needs further research. In addition, C&#8722;H glycosylation has a lot of shortcomings, which need to be further explored: a)&#8197;the precise regulation of stereoselectivity in the reaction process also needs further optimization; b)&#8197;the research on the reaction mechanism is almost limited to DFT calculation, and there is no exact experimental evidence. For key parts, such as the specific reaction mechanism between cyclo-metal intermediates and glycosyl donors in &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;Ar&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H glycosylation is still unclear; c)&#8197;due to the fact that aryl glycoside compounds contain bare hydroxyl groups in practical applications, it is an urgent problem to realize the compatibility of glycoside substrates containing naked hydroxyl groups or to remove the protective groups on hydroxyl groups by a mild and efficient method after the reaction; d) In this rapidly developing field, we need to study a greener, more economical and more practical C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes in the future, which will be conducive to the synthesis of C-aryl glycosides with more biological application significance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Electrocarboxylation reaction employs CO2 as a carboxylative reagent to prepare value&#8208;added carboxylic acid via organic electrosynthesis. In some cases, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This Concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.







Abstract
Electrocarboxylation reaction, which employs organic electrosynthesis to achieve the utilization of CO2 as a carboxylative reagent, provides a powerful and efficient tool for the preparation of organic carboxylic acid. In some electrocarboxylation reactions, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.

         <title>Redox Convergent Synthesis and Reactivity of a Cobalt(III)&#8208;Pentasulfido Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound has been synthesized by a unique redox convergent reaction between two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolate compounds and elemental sulfur. Detailed reactivity of the Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound towards reducing agents, phosphines, and proton, and transfer of the coordinated pentasulfido chain to selected organic compounds for the generation of organopolysulfide compounds have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A new mononuclear cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S5)] (3) has been synthesized by using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R=Ph, 2&#8201;a; 2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H4, 2&#8201;b), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)2Co2]2+ (1). Compound 3 features a low&#8208;spin, diamagnetic, Co(III) center with a coordinated pentasulfido (S52&#8722;) chain and has no precedence in the literature. Compound 3 is highly stable towards reduction with a potential of &#8722;1.36&#8197;V (vs. Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe) and gives back 1 upon chemical/electrochemical reduction. Reaction of 3 with phosphines yields back 1 and phosphine sulfides, while protonation of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 leads to the formation of 1, elemental sulfur and H2S. Finally, transfer of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 to selected organic compounds, such as MeI, PhCH2Br and PhCOCl, for the generation of organopolysulfido compounds has been demonstrated.

New molecular scaffolds of phenazine and pyrene are constructed by fusing them with oxanorbornene. The C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups as revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, which are independent on the overall molecular geometry.







Abstract
New molecular scaffolds of C&#8208;, Z&#8208; and box&#8208;shaped configurations are constructed by fusing phenazine and pyrene units with oxanorbornene. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups, and the box&#8208;shaped molecule accommodates two chloroform molecules in the cavity and forms H&#8208;bonds with another four molecules of chloroform. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped molecules as a pair of diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer between pyrene (&#960;&#8208;donor) and phenazine (&#960;&#8208;acceptor) is not dependent on the overall molecular geometry.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper deals with the synthesis and mechanistic aspects of supramolecular formation of trisubstituted amino&#8208;acid based chiral benzimidazoles, which show strong circular dichroism, gelation and fluorescence in CHCl3.







Abstract
Trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;tri(benzimidazolyl)benzene derivatives were synthesized from l&#8208;alanine, l&#8208;valine, d&#8208;valine and glycine, and their self&#8208;assembling behavior and stimuli&#8208;response in solution and gel states were evaluated. Circular dichroism/UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopic and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the compounds formed H&#8208;aggregates via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in nonpolar solvents such as CHCl3, whereas collapse of the aggregates was confirmed by MeOH addition. Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations also supported aggregation in CHCl3. Rheological analysis and morphology observation revealed the formation of a fibril like structure by further assembling of aggregates at a high concentration in CHCl3.

         <title>Caffeine Biodegradation by Cytochrome P450 1A2. What Determines the Product Distributions?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on large P450 enzyme models reproduce experimental product distributions excellently and highlight the second coordination sphere interactions in the protein.







Abstract
Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high&#8208;level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.

         <title>Mechanisms of the Reaction of Elemental Sulfur and Polysulfides with Cyanide and Phosphines
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic picture of the mechanisms of elemental sulfur and polysulfide decomposition is provided through Density Functional Theory calculations. Using cyanide and phosphines as prototypical nucleophiles, it is demonstrated that unimolecular decomposition and nucleophilic attack are the lowest&#8208;energy pathways involved in polysulfide reactivity.







Abstract
The reactions of elemental sulfur (S8) and polysulfides with nucleophiles are relevant to organic synthesis, materials science and biochemistry, but the mechanisms by which they operate are still unknown due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, we studied the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. All plausible pathways including nucleophilic decomposition, unimolecular decomposition, scrambling reactions, and attack on thiosulfoxides, have been considered to provide the first comprehensive mechanistic picture for this class of reactions. Overall, intramolecular cyclization is identified as the most favorable decomposition pathway for long polysulfides. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition, nucleophilic attack, and scrambling pathways can be expected.

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft has two cleft cavities, where electron&#8208;deficient guest molecules are accommodated with a strong negative cooperativity. The first guest binding affects the electronic structure of the rest of the cavity, reducing the electrostatic interaction in the successive guest binding. Thus, the degree of electron deficiencies of the guest molecules determines the extent of the cooperativity in the guest binding.







Abstract
The negative homotropic allostery of a triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft with two guest binding sites is confirmed. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest complexes showed that the trisporphyrin accommodated two guest molecules within the cleft through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. In solution, 1H&#8197;NMR and Job plots showed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the binding constants and cooperativities. The guest binding of the trisporphyrin showed negative cooperativity and non&#8208;cooperativity depending on the structures of the guest molecules. The correlations between the interaction parameters (&#945;) and Hill constants were determined. ITC experiments showed that the host&#8208;guest complexation of trisporphyrin with electron&#8208;deficient guests incurred an enthalpy penalty in the successive guest binding process. DFT calculations revealed that binding of the first guest reduced the electron density of the central porphyrin plane, which led to an energetic penalty that weakened the successive binding process.

         <title>Nanoscale Probing of the Supramolecular Assembly in a Two&#8208;Component Gel by Near&#8208;Field Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the nanoscale interactions: The determination of the secondary structure of supramolecular gels usually refers to the macroscopic material. It is shown that the secondary structure and non&#8208;covalent interactions driving the self&#8208;assembly vary at the nanoscale depending on the configuration of the fibrous network.







Abstract
The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self&#8208;assembly. Here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two&#8208;component supramolecular gel is introduced to assess the system's heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far&#8208;field IR spectroscopy, near&#8208;field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions at three distinct nano&#8208;locations of the gel network. A &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an &#945;&#8208;helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the &#946;&#8208;sheet motif is observed, with an intense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contribution. Near&#8208;field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non&#8208;covalent interactions, while it is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.

         <title>Exploring the Lewis Acidity and Reactivity of Neutral Pentacoordinate Dithienophospholes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The square pyramidal geometry in neutral pentavalent dithienophosphole&#8208;based Lewis acids is perturbed to distorted trigonal bipyramidal by implementing bulky substituents. With improved accessibility to the P center, these compounds are capable of mediating hydroboration of the catechol proceeding through umpolung of a hydride to a protonic species.







Abstract
A series of luminescent, neutral pentacoordinate dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]phosphole compounds was synthesized by [4+1] cycloaddition of o&#8208;quinones with the corresponding trivalent phospholes. The electronic and geometrical modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold implemented here impacts the aggregation behavior of the species in solution. It proved successful in generating species with improved Lewis acidity of the phosphorus center that was then leveraged for small&#8208;molecule activation. Hydride abstraction from an external substrate involving the hypervalent species is followed by an intriguing P&#8208;mediated umpolung from the hydride to a proton and supports the catalytic potential of this class of main&#8208;group Lewis acids for organic chemistry. This study is a comprehensive investigation into various methods, including electronic, chemical, geometric modifications (and sometimes combinations of these approaches) to systematically improve the Lewis acidity of neutral and stable main&#8208;group Lewis acids with practical value for a range of chemical transformations.

This study is a comprehensive investigation into various methods, including electronic, chemical, geometric modifications (and sometimes combinations of these approaches) to systematically improve the Lewis acidity of neutral and stable main-group Lewis acids with practical value for a range of chemical transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sidechain&#8208;Backbone Tetrel Bonding Interactions Provide a General Mechanism for trans&#8208;Peptoid Stabilization</title>

A sidechain&#8208;backbone nN&#8594;&#963;*C&#945;&#8722;N tetrel bonding interaction in azapeptoids wherein their sidechain &#945;&#8208;nitrogen lone pair (nN) is delocalized into the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8722;N bond is shown. Such sidechain&#8208;backbone interactions can provide a general mechanism of trans&#8208;amide stabilization in peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain.







Abstract
Cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amide bonds impedes de novo design of folded peptoids (poly&#8208;N&#8208;substituted glycines) with precise secondary structures and affects peptoid&#8208;biomolecule binding affinity. Herein, from X&#8208;ray, NMR and DFT studies of azapeptoids, we have discovered a tetrel bonding interaction that stabilizes trans&#8208;peptoids. We show that peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain adopt trans&#8208;amide geometries due to the presence of a nX/&#960;Ar&#8594;&#963;*C&#945;&#8722;N tetrel bonding interaction between the sidechain &#945;&#8208;heteroatom lone pair (nX) or &#960;&#8208;electrons (&#960;Ar) and the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8722;N bond. Further, CD spectroscopic studies of oligo&#8208;proline host&#8211;guest model peptides showed that azapeptoid residues stabilize polyproline II helical conformation. These data indicate that the sidechain&#8208;backbone tetrel bonding could be leveraged to design peptoids with precise secondary structures for a wide range of biological and material applications.

         <title>Intermetallic Compound TiM (M=Co, Fe) with a Layered Structure Prepared by Deoxidizing Ilmenite&#8208;type Oxides in Molten LiCl&#8208;CaH2 Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ilmenite&#8208;type oxides MTiO3 (M=Co, Fe) with layered structures perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure were mildly deoxidized by CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C to obtain intermetallic compounds TiM with layered structures after the deoxidation time of 15&#8211;120&#8197;min. During 1&#8211;5&#8197;min, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate to maintain the MTiO3&#8208;originated layered structure.







Abstract
CsCl&#8208;type intermetallic compounds TiM (M=Co, Fe) were obtained by deoxidizing trigonal ilmenite&#8208;type MTiO3 with a reducing agent CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the formation of nanoscale layered structures, which enhanced specific surface areas (approximately 20&#8197;m2/g) in the intermetallic compounds. In the initial deoxidation stage, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate, suggesting the substitution of M in MTiO3 by Li from the molten LiCl. Compound MTiO3 has a layered structure perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure, suggesting that the layered structures may originate from the crystal structure of the precursors. Formation of the Li2TiO3&#8208;like intermediate may help maintain the original layered structure during deoxidation and the subsequent alloying at temperatures as low as 600&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Esterase Specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An esterase&#8208;specific ratiometric fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, can distinguish live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity. The action of the esterase enzyme and active site for binding with the probe is demonstrated by MD simulation and QM/MM calculations.







Abstract
Esterases enzymes regulate the body's homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase&#8216;s active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH&#8764;8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM&#8208;OAc) binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image&#8208;based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.

         <title>Trading Symmetry for Stereoinduction in Tetradentate, non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Fe(II)&#8208;Complexes for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C1&#8208;symmetric bench&#8208;stable stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes comprising a linear, tetradentate ligand scaffold are introduced. The possibility of lowering the overall symmetry is scrutinized for an enantioselective ring&#8208;contraction of isoxazoles to furnish chiral 2H&#8208;azirines under open&#8208;flask conditions with the products serving as useful building blocks to access &#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
A series of stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;metal iron complexes comprising a non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric chiral topology is introduced and applied to asymmetric 3d&#8208;transition metal catalysis. The chiral iron(II) complexes are built from chiral tetradentate N4&#8208;ligands containing a proline&#8208;derived amino pyrrolidinyl backbone which controls the relative (cis&#8208;&#945; coordination) and absolute metal&#8208;centered configuration (&#923; vs. &#916;). Two chloride ligands complement the octahedral coordination sphere. The modular composition of the tetradentate ligands facilitates the straightforward incorporation of different terminal coordinating heteroaromatic groups into the scaffold. The influence of various combinations was evaluated in an asymmetric ring contraction of isoxazoles to 2H&#8208;azirines revealing that a decrease of symmetry is beneficial for the stereoinduction to obtain chiral products in up to 99&#8201;% yield and with up to 92&#8201;%&#8201;ee. Conveniently, iron catalysis is feasible under open flask conditions with the bench&#8208;stable dichloro complexes exhibiting high robustness towards oxidative or hydrolytic decomposition. The versatility of non&#8208;racemic 2H&#8208;azirines was subsequently showcased with the conversion into a variety of quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.

The influence of various combinations was evaluated in an asymmetric ring contraction of isoxazoles to 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirines revealing that a decrease of symmetry is beneficial for the stereoinduction to obtain chiral products in up to 99&#8201;% yield and with up to 92&#8201;%&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. Conveniently, iron catalysis is feasible under open flask conditions with the bench-stable dichloro complexes exhibiting high robustness towards oxidative or hydrolytic decomposition. The versatility of non-racemic 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-azirines was subsequently showcased with the conversion into a variety of quaternary &#945;-amino acid derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective and Quantitative Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Diagnostic Method for Adrenaline</title>

The selectivity of a donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) formation towards epinephrine and an activated furfural moiety was exploited to generate a single&#8208;molecule colorimetric probe for the neurotransmitter epinephrine. An error&#8208;free detection of epinephrine among nine neurotransmitters was demonstrated. Quantitative prediction of epinephrine with high precision was carried out by using images and its analysis with machine&#8208;learning techniques.







Abstract
Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a neurotransmitter/hormone that is an important target in diagnostics. Development of an effective method for detecting it in the presence of other neurotransmitters is a challenging task. The electrochemical and fluorescent techniques commonly used have low selectivity in distinguishing among catecholamines. Herein, a small&#8208;molecule organic probe with an activated furfural moiety is reported to exploit the nucleophilicity of epinephrine to generate a bright&#8208;colored donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct. Among nine common neurotransmitters or their analogues, only epinephrine was found to generate a unique colour change discernible with the naked eye, whereas the other ones remain unaffected. Under various in&#8208;field detection conditions, including solution, droplet, and paper strip&#8208;based detection, the colour change were also noticeable. The low detection limit of 1.37&#8197;nM and a limit of quantitation of 4.37&#8197;nM were achieved with simple UV/Vis methods in addition to the sub&#8208;ppm level sensing under visual conditions with naked eyes. The probe could be used for practical colorimetric measurements as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care tool without any complex and expensive machinery, making this approach accessible to all. In addition, using a simple smartphone, the determination of epinephrine concentrations is possible by using machine&#8208;learning techniques.

         <title>Trumpet&#8208;Like ZnS@C Composite for High&#8208;Performance Potassium Ion Battery Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIBs) anode, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite exhibits excellent rate property and cyclic performance. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge/discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer.







Abstract
ZnS has acquired increasing attention for high&#8208;performance PIBs anode because of its remarkable theoretical capacity, and redox reversibility for conversion reaction. However, the larger volume variation and delayed reaction kinetics for the ZnS in the discharge/charge processes lead to pulverization and severe capacity degradation. Herein, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method by using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIB) anode, ZnS@C composite exhibits good rate performance and long life (stable reversible capacity of 107.8&#8197;mAh/g over 2000&#8197;charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 5&#8197;A/g and high reversible capacity of 310&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer. This method of synthesizing trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite provides an important strategy for obtaining potassium ion batteries anode with long cycle.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Nickel Cobalt Phosphide Nanocrosses with Well&#8208;Defined Axial Arms for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses with well&#8208;defined six axial arms and high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks are highly efficient as electro&#8208;catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Concave nanostructure with highly branched architecture and abundant step atoms is one kind of desirable materials for energy conversion devices. However, current synthetic strategies for non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based NiCoP concave nanostructure still remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a site&#8208;selective chemical etching and subsequent phosphorating strategy to fabricate highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses (HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs). The HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs are consisted of six axial arms in three&#8208;dimensional space and each protruding arm is equipped with high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks. As an electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction, the HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs exhibit remarkably enhanced activity and stability, with small overpotential of 289&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the NiCoP nanocages and commercial RuO2. The superior OER performance of HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs is originated from the highly branched concave structure, the synergistic effect between bimetal Ni and Co atoms, as well as the electronic structure modulation from P.

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>

         <dc:description>
A synthetic tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin (FePEG5kTPP) formed an 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with a face&#8208;to&#8208;face cyclodextrin dimer in aqueous solution. The O2 adduct of the ferrous complex shows similar O2 binding affinity with natural hemoglobin and a long circulation time in blood, leading to the simple supramolecular complex that can be used as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur is described. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is much greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.

Various transformations of the initial cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand in the triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] show that the reaction with main group nucleophiles yields different products depending on the steric demand of the nucleophile used. Subsequent oxidation/electrophilic quenching provides a plethora of P5R2 and P6R3 organophosphorus ligand complexes in unique 1,3 or 1,4 substitution pattern as opposed to the parent complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)].







Abstract
The heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] (1) was functionalized by main group nucleophiles and subsequently electrophilically quenched or oxidized. Reacting 1 with group&#8197;14 nucleophiles revealed different organo&#8208;substituted P5R middle&#8208;decks depending on the steric and electronic effects of the used alkali metal organyls (2: R=tBu; 3: R=Me). Further, with group&#8197;15 nucleophiles, the first structural characterized monosubstituted complexes with phosphanides could be obtained as P5 ligands containing exocyclic {PR2} units (4: R=Cy, H; 5: R=Ph). These monoanionic complexes 2&#8211;5 were isolated and subsequent electrophilic quenching revealed novel types of neutral functionalized polyphosphorus complexes. These complexes bear formal chains of P5R'R&#8217;&#8217; (6: R&#8217;=tBu, R&#8217;=Me) in a 1,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern or P6R'R&#8217;&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; units (7: R&#8217;=Cy, R&#8217;&#8217;=H, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me; 8: R&#8217;=Me, R&#8217;&#8217;=Ph, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me) in a 1,1,3&#8208;substitution as middle&#8208;decks stabilized by one {Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co} and one {Cp*Fe} fragment. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2, 3 or 5 by AgBF4 gave access to paramagnetic triple&#8208;decker complexes bearing P5R middle&#8208;decks in various coordination fashions (R=tBu (10), R=PPh2 (12)). Interestingly, for R=Me (11), a dimerization is observed revealing a diamagnetic tetranuclear cluster containing a unique dihydrofulvalene&#8208;type P10R2 ligand. All complexes were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods (EPR, multinuclear NMR and mass spectrometry) and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Constructed by Responsive Chiral Aggregation&#8208;induced Emission Luminophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;standing film constructed by responsive chiral AIE luminophore not only showed highly efficient CPL (glum&#8764;+0.75), but also exhibited a wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL from blue to yellow (503&#8197;nm to 548&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Key Lab of Environment&#8208;friendly Chemistry and Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials with multitudinous inherent advantages shows extensive application. In this work, we prepare a kind of highly efficient wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL free&#8208;standing films by responsive chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission mesogen. Firstly, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene monomer (MPy) is designed and synthesized. Then, the different ration of the monomer MPy mixed with the liquid crystal (LC) reactive monomer (LC242) to fabricate a free&#8208;standing film by photopolymerization. The obtained film presents efficient CPL with a constant luminescence asymmetry factor (glum) of +0.75, as well as sensitive wavelength tunability. Finally, this wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL film with both fluorescence and CPL modes is successfully applied in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. This work provides a simple way to construct CPL apparatus with adjustable luminescence wavelength and high glum.

         <title>Quantitative Electromerism of a Well&#8208;defined Mononuclear Copper Complex Through Reversible Intramolecular Metal&#8208;Ligand Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
Electromerism in coordination chemistry allows to control the electron distribution and thereby the physical properties and reactivity. Here the first example for quantitative temperature&#8208;dependent electromerism of a mononuclear copper complex is reported, and the factors responsible for this behaviour are analysed.







Abstract
Copper amine oxidases are enzymes that exhibit in their active site a mononuclear copper complex and a 2,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor; in the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle, the enzymes regulate their activity by a temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer equilibrium between the CuII complex with the reduced, aminoquinol form of the cofactor and the reactive CuI complex with the corresponding oxidized, semiquinone form of the cofactor. Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.

         <title>Pd&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Nanochains for Electroreduction of CO2 to Syngas in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdxBi bimetallic nanochains can electrochemically reduce CO2 to syngas with adjustable CO/H2 ratios from 1/7 to 9/1. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains could be ascribed to the incorporation of moderate Bi into Pd lattice, which brought about strong adsorption capacity of CO2, abundant active sites, and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during the electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H2 ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium&#8208;bismuth (Pd&#8722;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 to 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7&#8201;% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.

Herein, a series of palladium-bismuth (Pd&#8722;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to syngas in ionic liquid-based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 to 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; when the CO/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio was approximately 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7&#8201;% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid-based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity, more active sites and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Approach to Synthetic Lectin for Glucose with Boosted Binding Affinity through C&#8722;H Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed by using dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The design of the receptor features two parallel durene panels forming a hydrophobic pocket. The incorporation of two pyridinium residues enhances water solubility and improves substrate binding by establishing more hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed with high affinity and selectivity. The receptor was efficiently synthesized in three steps through dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The receptor features two parallel durene panels, forming a hydrophobic pocket for [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions, and two pyridinium residues directing four amide bonds towards the pocket. These pyridinium residues not only improve solubility but also provide polarized C&#8722;H bonds for hydrogen bonding. Experimental data and DFT calculations show that these polarized C&#8722;H bonds significantly enhance substrate binding. These findings demonstrate the power of dynamic covalent chemistry for creating molecular receptors and using polarized C&#8722;H bonds for boosted carbohydrate recognition in water, providing a foundation for developing glucose&#8208;responsive materials and sensors.

Putting the contortion back into the truxene fragments. Substitution of the methylene fragments by strongly electron accepting phosphaalkene or arsaalkenes provides new tuning opportunities for twisted PAHs.







Abstract
We report the functionalization and deplanarization of truxenes using pnictaalkene fragments. Selective introduction of one, two, or three Mes*&#8208;Pn fragments provides up to three fully reversible reductions based on the Pn=C fragments. The incorporation of the unsaturated heteroelement fragment as well as the contortion of the truxene core result in significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and interesting opto&#8208;electronic properties which are studied by electrochemistry and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. Incorporation of arsaalkene (As=C) motifs gives significantly milder reduction potentials and red&#8208;shifted absorption, while phosphaalkene decorated truxene P3 can be functionalized using Au(I)Cl coordination. Furthermore, solubility is markedly increased upon incorporation of the Pn&#8208;Mes* fragments which renders these materials suitable for solution processing.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding (ChB) as a Robust Supramolecular Recognition Motif of Benzisothiazolinone Antibacterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>

BenzIsothiazolinones are commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents. In these heterocycles, the propensity of sulfur to form N&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds is robust enough to allow for the interaction to act as a general and reliable recognition motif in chemical environments suggesting that this may be the case also in biological environment.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;benzisothiazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derivatives are highly active against a broad spectrum of fungi as well as Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. For this reason they are extensively used, for example, as additives in detergents, leather products, paper coatings, and antifouling paintings. In this paper experimental findings are reported proving that the sulfur atom of benzisothiazolinones have a remarkable tendency to form short and directional chalcogen bondings on the extension of the covalent N&#8722;S bond and, to a lesser extent, of the C&#8722;S bond. Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database confirm the interaction as a primary recognition motif of these systems. The electrophilicity of sulfur is crucial in the chemical reactions initiating the cascade of events resulting in the biopharmacological activities of benzisothiazolinones. The reported results suggest that the electrophility of sulfur may play a role also at earlier stages than the reactive ones, namely it may pin the compounds at the active site of target enzymes via chalcogen bondings that preorganize the system in the conformation required for the bonds formation/cleavage determining the biopharmacological activity

Ligands derived from bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide units are found to provide a suitably rigid backbone for the synthesis of porous metal&#8208;organic cages. Crystallographic studies show that the cages display a degree of flexibility in the solid state, while the activation protocols followed are a determining factor in the gas uptake capacity of the cages.







Abstract
Three new ligands containing a bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide unit have been used to assemble lantern&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic cages with the general formula [Cu4L4]. Functionalisation of the backbone of the ligands leads to distinct crystal packing motifs between the three cages, as observed with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The three cages vary in their gas sorption behaviour, and the capacity of the materials for CO2 is found to depend on the activation conditions: softer activation conditions lead to superior uptake, and one of the cages displays the highest BET surface area found for lantern&#8208;type cages so far.

         <title>Functional Characterisation of Highly Conserved and Structurally Prominent Residues of 2&#8208;Methylisoborneol Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases phylogenetically unrelated to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor (ScMIBS) were functionally characterised. ScMIBS was extensively investigated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in 31 positions that were selected based on the enzyme structure and their high conservation, revealing several structural motifs that are important for catalysis.







Abstract
2&#8208;Methylisoborneol is a widespread musty odourant that is produced by many bacteria including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria and myxobacteria. Two 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases (MIBS) that are phylogenetically distant to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor were found to be highly active for 2&#8208;methylisoborneol biosynthesis. Based on the enzyme structure and on an amino acid sequence alignment, the MIBS from S. coelicolor was extensively studied through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two new 2-methylisoborneol synthases phylogenetically unrelated&lt;/b&gt; to the known enzyme from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; (ScMIBS) were functionally characterised. ScMIBS was extensively investigated by site-directed mutagenesis in 31 positions that were selected based on the enzyme structure and their high conservation, revealing several structural motifs that are important for catalysis.

         <title>Traceless N&#8208;Polyfluoroalkylation of Weakly Nucleophilic Nitrogen Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation reactions are challenging due to the high cost, toxicity or environmental impact of commonly used polyfluoroalkylation reagents. We report the sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2)&#8208;mediated N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of weakly nucleophilic nitrogen compounds from readily available fluorinated alcohols. This method opens access to a variety of N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylated building blocks that are highly valuable for life science applications.







Abstract
Here we report an efficient access to high&#8208;value N&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and N,N&#8208;bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). The in&#8197;situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8208;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Hydrogenation/Deuteration of Benzylic Olefins Enabled by Electroreduction Using Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of benzylic olefins has been applied to site&#8208;selectively hydrogenate such double bonds while other functions that react under regular hydrogenation conditions are present. By the use of water as proton source this protocol also allows deuteration by simply switching to D2O. The applicability of this method was shown by the use of a commercially available electrolysis setup and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
We describe an operationally simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol that allows the site&#8208;selective hydrogenation and deuteration of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted benzylic olefins by electroreduction while other groups prone to hydrogenation are present. The radical anionic intermediates react with the most inexpensive hydrogen/deuterium source H2O/D2O. Our method overcomes many limitations that arise from previously reported electroreductive hydrogenations. The applicability of this reaction is demonstrated by a broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples) that focuses on functional group tolerance and sites that are affected by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (alkenes, alkynes, protecting groups).

         <title>Flow Electrochemistry for the N&#8208;Nitrosation of Secondary Amines</title>

Go with the flow: N&#8208;Nitroso compounds have been synthesised from secondary amines by using sodium nitrite in an electrochemical flow setup. A 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of acetonitrile and water was used for this reaction, making this a mild approach avoiding the use of additional supporting electrolytes. N&#8208;Nitrosamines could be obtained in yields up to 99&#8201;%, and several compounds could be purified with an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.







Abstract
A flow electrochemical method towards the synthesis of N&#8208;nitroso compounds from secondary amines using cheap and readily available sodium nitrite has been developed. Sodium nitrite dissolved in aqueous acetonitrile made additional electrolytes unnecessary. This mild and straightforward approach made the use of acids or other harsh and toxic chemicals redundant. This procedure was applied to an assortment of cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (27 examples) resulting in yields of N&#8208;nitrosamines as high as 99&#8201;%. To demonstrate the practicality of the process, scaled&#8208;up reactions were performed. Finally, selected products could be purified by using an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.

Electrochemistry is a valuable tool used by modern synthetic chemists who use electricity to facilitate redox reactions. In this image, created by Karrar Nadhom, the dragon provides the electrical surge to create a reaction between sodium nitrite and a secondary amine, which are fused to form the N&#8208;nitroso product. Despite dragons being extinct in most parts of the world, the title reaction is an ecologically green process, as indicated by the colour of the dragon. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Wirth and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300957).

In this image, created by Karrar Nadhom, the dragon provides the electrical surge to create a reaction between sodium nitrite and a secondary amine, which are fused to form the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitroso product. Despite dragons being extinct in most parts of the world, the title reaction is an ecologically green process, as indicated by the colour of the dragon.

         <title>Front Cover: Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft (Chem. Eur. J. 32/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin molecule possessing two cleft cavities showed negative homotropic cooperativity in the host&#8211;guest complex. When an electron&#8208;deficient guest molecule (yellow) was accommodated within one of the cleft cavities, the electronic structure of the porphyrin was altered, and the binding power of the remaining cavity was reduced. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Haino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300107).

         <title>Spin in Organic Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 32, June 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, we highlight the recent advancement of the spin effect in organic cocrystals. Besides the magnetic and multiferroic properties in binary/ternary cocrystals and radical cocrystals, other spin phenomena (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) and the mobility on spin transport are discussed. The better comprehension of current achievements and challenges could offer guidance for the further development of organic spintronics.







Abstract
Organic spintronics has caused a huge revolution in creating highly efficient low&#8208;power circuits. Spin manipulation in organic cocrystals has become a promising strategy to uncover more chemicophysical properties for diverse applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements of spin properties in organic charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals, and briefly describe the possible mechanisms behind them. Beside the known spin properties (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) in binary/ternary cocrystals, other spin phenomena in radical cocrystals and spin transport are also summarized and discussed. Hopefully, deep understanding of current achievements, challenges and perspectives will offer the clear direction for the introduction of spin in organic cocrystals.

         <title>Steric Control over the Threading of Pyrophosphonates with One or Two Cyanostar Macrocycles during Pseudorotaxane Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over the binding stoichiometry and the threading kinetics is achieved in pseudorotaxanes comprising the anion&#8208;binding cyanostar macrocycle and organic pyrophosphonates with fine&#8208;tuned steric bulk. The approach allowed the selective assembly of [3]pseudorotaxanes and [2]pseudorotaxanes, and it provided insights that are valuable for future work on anion recognition and the design of molecular machines.







Abstract
The supramolecular recognition of anions is increasingly harnessed to achieve the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular architectures, ranging from cages and polymers to (pseudo)rotaxanes. The cyanostar (CS) macrocycle has previously been shown to form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with organophosphate anions that can be turned into [3]rotaxanes by stoppering. Here we achieved steric control over the assembly of pseudorotaxanes comprising the cyanostar macrocycle and a thread that is based, for the first time, on organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates. Subtle differences in steric bulk on the threads allowed formation of either [3]pseudorotaxanes or [2]pseudorotaxanes. We demonstrate that the threading kinetics are governed by the steric demand of the organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates and in one case, slows down to the timescale of minutes. Calculations show that the dianions are sterically offset inside the macrocycles. Our findings broaden the scope of cyanostar&#8208;anion assemblies and may have relevance for the design of molecular machines whose directionality is a result of relatively slow slipping.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which is driven by inexpensive electricity, is a green and unique approach to otherwise challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The difficulty associated with the technique is imposed by the fleeting nature of radicals and the gap between electrodes. This concept article introduces recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in this field and discusses how to overcome the obstacles.







Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low&#8208;cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half&#8208;reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances on radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminum Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate supported aluminum complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L= [HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further utilized as synthons to generate some fascinating cationic aluminum alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#181;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminum halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Chemical Synthesis of Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal&#8208;type 13 (SPINK13) Glycoform by a Combined Method with Glycan Insertion Strategy and Fast&#8208;Flow Fmoc SPPS

         <dc:description>
Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments at the sterically bulky amino acids sequence Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). The both N and C terminus peptides were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method. A combined method with DDC, TCL and a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method successfully shortened the route of glycoprotein synthesis.







Abstract
Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 13 (SPINK13) is a secreted protein that has been recently studied as a therapeutic drug and an interesting biomarker for cancer cells. Although SPINK13 has a consensus sequence (Pro&#8208;Asn&#8208;Val&#8208;Thr) for N&#8208;glycosylation, the existence of N&#8208;glycosylation and its functions are still unclear. In addition to this, the preparation of glycosylated SPINK 13 has not been examined by both the cell expression method and chemical synthesis. Herein we report the chemical synthesis of the scarce N&#8208;glycosylated form of SPINK13 by a rapid synthetic method combined with the chemical glycan insertion strategy and a fast&#8208;flow SPPS method. Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments where is the sterically bulky Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). This insertion strategy successfully afforded the full&#8208;length polypeptide of SPINK13 within two steps from glycosylated asparagine thioacid. Because the two peptides used for this synthesis were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow SPPS, the total synthetic time of glycoprotein was considerably shortened. This synthetic concept enables us to repetitively synthesize a target glycoprotein easily. Folding experiments afforded well&#8208;folded structure confirmed by CD and disulfide bond map. Invasion assays of glycosylated SPINK13 and non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK13 with pancreatic cancer cells showed that non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK&#8208;13 was more potent than that of glycosylated SPINK13.

         <title>Highly Soluble Cyclic Organoalanes Based on Anionic Dicarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2&#8208;core embedded between two peripheral 1,3&#8208;imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two&#8208; and four&#8208;fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively. Further hydroalumination reactivity of [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 has been shown with isocyanate (RNCO) and isothiocyanate (RNCS) species (R = alkyl or aryl group). All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles as Clients of Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate&#8208;targeting agents.
Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase&#8208;separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self&#8208;condensates of tau, two&#8208;component tau/polyanion and three&#8208;component tau/RNA/alpha&#8208;synuclein coacervates.
The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) &#8211; scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.
Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of neuraminidase&#8208;resistant sialyllactose mimetics from Nacyl mannosamines using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#945;2,3&#8208; and &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose oligosaccharides as well as mimetics from N&#8208;acyl mannosamines and lactose in metabolically engineered bacterial cells grown at high cell density. We designed new E. coli strains coexpressing sialic acid synthase and N&#8208;acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni together with the &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis or the &#945;2,6sialyltransferase from Photobacterium sp. JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized N&#8208;acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its N&#8208;propanoyl (N&#8208;Prop), N&#8208;butanoyl (N&#8208;But) and N&#8208;phenylacetyl (N&#8208;PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10% and 39% (200&#8208;700 mg.L&#8208;1 of culture). The three &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for Sambucus nigra SNA&#8208;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. These N&#8208;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.</dc:description>

In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva = 9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb = 1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. Besides, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa = 9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote the hexagon&#8208;like and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Ion Pairing of &#954;6N Complexes with Rare Earth Elements in the Solid State and in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare earth element complexes (Ln = Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several podant &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating ligands have been synthetized and thoroughly characterized. The structural properties of the complexes have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction in the solid state and by advanced NMR methods in solution. To estimate the donor capabilities of the presented ligands, an experimental comparison study has been conducted by cyclic voltammetry as well as absorption experiments using the cerium complexes and by analyzing 89Y NMR chemical shifts of the different yttrium complexes. In order to obtain a complete and detailed picture, all experiments were corroborated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations. Finally, coordination competition studies have been carried out by means of 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the correlation with donor properties and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Fluorescent Isocoumarin&#8208;Fused&#160;Oxacyclononyne / 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne
IC9O&#8208;COOMe that is reactive in SPAAC and gives fluorescent triazoles regardless of an azide nature was developed. The study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies showed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of &#945;&#8208;pyrone and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier can be increased by introducing an acceptor group into a position with a decreasing electron density. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;COOMe bearing electron withdrawing group (COOMe) at the C6 position, which actually turned out to be fluorescent and underwent SPAAC to form fluorescent triazole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxylation, Dehydrogenative&#8208;Polymerization and Tandem Hydrosilylative&#8208;Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative&#8208;polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late&#8208;transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)4(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si&#8208;O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as &#946;&#8208;citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide&#8208;silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic CO2 electrolysis addressing the "alkalinity issue" and achieving high CO2 utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favorable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favorable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers' attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the "alkalinity problem" and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.</dc:description>

FeP@CoP nanorods derived from pyramidal metal organic frameworks were developed as aluminum&#8208;ion battery cathode, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and fast electron transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite was developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode maintains a high capacity of 168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;A g&#8722;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. These findings inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Dion&#8211;Jacobson Layered Perovskite Polymorphs of KWO3F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural relationship between the known normal&#8208;pressure modification of KWO3F and its two new siblings synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature is explored. The three polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of symmetry, but all of them belong to an overarching Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite structure type. In addition to a thorough examination of the phase transitions of KWO3F specifically, this work provides a closer look at the role of anion site occupation in phase transitions of mixed&#8208;anion compounds.







Abstract
Two new Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F are reported. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at &#8764;311&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.

         <title>A Feasible Strategy for a Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Over 900&#8201;nm Based on Phenalenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel NIR TADF organic emitters, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, were first designed and compared in parallel. Neat films of OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA present real NIR emission with peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. Encouragingly, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DBBPA exhibits a maximum of 0.103&#8201;% with an emission at a peak wavelength of 906&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer from the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Herein, 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1&#8208;phenalene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T1) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S1) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL performances in the TADF emitter&#8208;based NIR&#8208;OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.

         <title>Nms&#8208;Amides: An Amine Protecting Group with Unique Stability and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While p&#8208;toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability and robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this conundrum, we herein present Nms&#8208;amides, initially developed through in silico studies, which overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise, enabling a range of transformations that are not possible with traditional sulfonamide protecting groups.

In an effort to resolve this predicament, we herein present a new sulfonamide protecting group, which we term Nms. Initially developed through in silico studies, Nms&#8208;amides overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise. We have investigated the incorporation, robustness and cleavability of this group and found it to be superior to traditional sulfonamide protecting groups in a broad range of case studies.

         <title>Isoform&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; by Acrylamide&#8208;Containing Fusicoccins</title>

14&#8208;3&#8208;3 isoforms and the elucidation of their biological roles: In vitro isoform&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; was achieved by a fusicoccin derivative containing a fluorophore and a Cys&#8208;directed acrylamide group. The reaction proceeds upon ternary complex formation with mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide, which possesses i+1 aliphatic residues.







Abstract
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; isoform was evaluated, which possesses a unique Cys38, and a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent was designed by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ER&#945;, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Direct C(3)5&#8722;H Polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;Amino/alkoxy Pyridines Enabled by a Transient and Electron&#8208;deficient Palladium Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transiently formed electrophilic polyfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species overrides the unproductive N&#8208;coordination enabling a remote selective polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines. The strategy allowed rapid construction of polyfluorinated heterobiaryls containing bioactive molecules and drug derivatives in good yields.







Abstract
Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method's utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity. Importantly, the first experimental evidence for the role of diisopropyl sulfide is provided.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure Sensitive Piezochromic Fluorescence Switching of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Anthraquinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) is based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic crystal strategy. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation.







Abstract
Sensing of low&#8208;pressure signals is of great importance for cutting&#8208;edge technologies. Organic piezochromic molecules offer a promising library of pressure sensitive materials which can be tailor&#8208;designed toward specific requirements. However, very few examples of low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescent molecules have been obtained till date, and the underlying mechanisms are still in its infancy. Herein, we report highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic phase strategy. The influence of both intramolecular conformation effect and variations of intermolecular stacking modes on the piezochromic property of TPE&#8208;AQ is investigated. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements combined with simulations. This work provides a way to design highly efficient pressure sensors based on organic molecular systems.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nitrogen&#8208;centered heptalene, azaheptalene, was designed as a representative of a new class of redox&#8208;responsive molecules with a large steric strain that originates from the adjacent seven&#8208;membered rings. The pentabenzo derivative of azaheptalene was efficiently synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of commercially available reagents. Bromination led to mono&#8208; and dibrominated derivatives, the latter of which is interconvertible with isolable radical cation species exhibiting near&#8208;infrared absorption. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity with a large torsion angle, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Thus, optically pure azaheptalenes with P&#8208; or M&#8208;helicity showed strong chiroptical properties (|gabs| &#8805; 0.01), which could be changed by an electric potential.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization offers exciting possibilities for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic compounds. Herein, we revealed a chemodivergent tandem cyclization of alkene substituted quinazolinones under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free system, this transformation is initiated by alkyl radicals produced from oxidant&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of alkyl nitriles or esters. The reaction resulted in the selective synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones by modulating the loading of oxidant, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Mechanistic investigations show that the mono&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is constructed by the key process of 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift, while the di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is mainly achieved through crucial steps of spin delocalization and proton transfer. This protocol is the first example of remote second alkylation on the aromatic ring via &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization and difunctionalization achieved by association of two unsaturated bonds in radical cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chirality transfer strategy was established to access enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates stereogenic only at the B&#8208;atom. First, a library of chiral boron O,N&#8208;complexes was synthesized in diastereoselective fashion. The generated stereoinformation at boron was then transferred via the ate&#8208;complex into the boron C,N&#8208;chelates.Twitter affiliations: @LaschatGroup, @YStoeckl







Abstract
Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications, for example as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, this study reports a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86&#8201;% yield and d.r. &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84&#8201;% yield and e.r. up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation/electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural analogous ionic liquids (ILs) and electrolytes comprising oligoether&#8208;based flexible aromatic anions offer different physicochemical properties. The designed ILs and the electrolytes are fluorine&#8208;free and have better physicochemical properties than conventional electrolytes and have a great potential to be used as electrolytes in next generation batteries, in particular those operating at elevated temperatures and with limited electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
Five new n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+ cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330&#8201;&#176;C), phase behaviour (Tg&lt;&#8722;55&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10&#8197;mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the Li+ ions and the carboxylate group of the anions. Electrochemically, the electrolytes have electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5&#8197;V, giving some promise for battery application.

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of the nitrogen in the thiazole ring, which acts as the organic ligand of Bi&#8208;based MOF (Bi&#8208;MMTAA), results in a pronounced redshift in light absorption. This protonation also accelerates charge separation and transfer and ultimately improves photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
In this work, a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand is reported, namely, the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to p&#8208;cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen&#8208;containing Bi&#8208;based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynes for Synthesis of CF3Se&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynes with EtOH as the green solvent was developed. Various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, including indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes have been synthesized with trifluoromethyl selenoxides as CF3Se source.







Abstract
Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf2O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF3Se&#8208;containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF3Se species was proposed.

         <title>Synthesis and Crystallographic Characterization of Helical Hairpin Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamer hairpin&#8208;like motifs have been prepared by connecting oligourea helices with various alkyl and aralkyl linkers, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Some specific geometrical parameters like interhelical dihedral angles and helical twists were measured, thus allowing precise comparison between the different supersecondary structures. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Dolain, G. Guichard and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300087). Artwork by Christel Dolain.

One cleavage &#8208; many possibilities: A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of enantiopure P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes has been established via a nucleophilic P&#8722;N bond cleavage of 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN). The procedure can be modified to give &#8220;custom&#8208;made&#8221; ligands by selecting various nucleophiles and PAN derivatives to control the steric and electronic properties. Phosphorus(III) compounds derived from this procedure are expected to be effective ligands in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The reactive P&#8722;N bond in a racemic mixture of endo&#8208;1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN) (RP/SP)&#8208;endo&#8208;1 is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air&#8208;stable P&#8208;chiral diastereomeric 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) P&#8208;stereogenic 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Unimolecular Reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; Complexes (R=Organyl): Stepwise versus Concerted Mechanism in Copper&#8208;Mediated Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations affords detailed insight into the reactivity of high&#8208;valent trifluoromethylated cuprate complexes. Depending on the nature of the organyl group R, these key intermediates of synthetically valuable trifluoromethylation reactions lose two radicals or undergo concerted reductive eliminations.







Abstract
The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R=organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, the potential energy surfaces of these systems are explored by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=Me, Et, Bu, sBu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8901;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8901; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8901;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.

         <dc:description>
This concept article provides new opportuinies of employing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid platforms to activate small molecules like hydrogen due to intrinsic sites in MOFs that behave as frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thus featuring new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis using MOFs as solid catalysts.New Opportunities in Metal&#8211;organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis (Garcia, Dhakshinamoorthy, and Asiri)







Abstract
This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10&#8197;bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8722;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.

&lt;p&gt;This concept article provides new opportuinies of employing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid platforms to activate small molecules like hydrogen due to intrinsic sites in MOFs that behave as frustrated Lewis acid-base pairs, thus featuring new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis using MOFs as solid catalysts.New Opportunities in Metal&#8211;organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis (Garcia, Dhakshinamoorthy, and Asiri)

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid-base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid-base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO-66 and MIL-101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressures below 10&#8197;bar. The influence of electron-donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density-functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8722;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereochemically Active Tin(II)&#8208;Induced Enhancement of Birefringence in SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new tin(II) phosphates SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2 exhibit enhanced birefringence by introducing the tin(II) ions with stereochemically active lone pairs. And in particular for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, the hydrogen groups facilitate more aligned Sn2+&#8208;centered oxygen polyhedra. Moreover, the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance measurement further indicates that their cut off edges are 262 and 263&#8197;nm, which can be used as a new UV birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Two new tin(II) phosphates, SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, were synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method and hydrothermal method, respectively. Theoretical study indicates that by introducing tin(II) with stereochemical activity lone pairs (SCALP) in metal phosphates, the birefringence was enhanced, 0.048@1064&#8197;nm for SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and 0.080@1064&#8197;nm for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2.

         <title>[2+4] Cycloaddition Product of an Amidinate Substituted Dialumene with Toluene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient dialumene based on an amidinate scaffold was synthesized. The complex was isolated as a cycloaddition product with toluene. The mechanism of the reaction investigated using the DFT method indicates a free energy barrier of 0.9&#8197;kcal/mol with respect to the monomeric AlI intermediate.







Abstract
Reduction of LAlI2 (L=PhC(NiPr2C6H3)2) with two equivalents of KC8 in toluene affords the [2+4]cycloaddition product of a dialumene with toluene. The mechanism for the formation of product complex was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) methods.

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mapping the constellation of structural and dynamic changes concurrent with allosteric inhibitor binding to caspase&#8208;7, also known as allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs), reveals the nexus between the active site and the remote allosteric pocket. These ASARs also elucidate the link between structure and catalytic power for caspase&#8208;7. Our insights from exploration of caspase&#8208;7 allostery offer a new path for navigating allosteric drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;A. Spies and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300872).

However, despite this interest, the development of efficient reagents to perform trilfuoromethoxylation reactions remains a challenge.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Rubicene&#8208;Based Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Compounds as Five&#8208;Membered Ring Embedded Planar Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds embedding five&#8208;membered rings. The target compounds with t&#8208;butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of precursors consisting of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and the DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic frameworks. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands considerably red&#8208;shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near&#8208;IR region while retaining the emissive property.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;-conjugated compounds embedding five-membered rings. The target compounds with t-butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of precursors consisting of 9,10-diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. The single-crystal X-ray analysis and the DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic frameworks. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands considerably red-shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near-IR region while retaining the emissive property. The narrowed HOMO-LUMO gap with the extension of the &#960;-conjugation was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed C8&#8208;H borylation of 4&#8208;quinolones via transient O&#8208;borylated quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline/4&#8208;quinolone tautomerization has been harnessed to achieve directed, regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones. Introduced as the 4&#8208;quinolone, the O&#8208;borylated quinoline is initially formed. Critically, the newly&#8208;formed 4&#8208;(pinBO)&#8208;quinolines then undergoes Ir&#8208;catalysed, N&#8208;directed, selective C&#8208;H functionalization/borylation at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the 4&#8208;quinolone tautomer. The C8&#8208;borylated quinolines were converted to their corresponding potassium trifluoroborate (BF3K) salts and to their C8&#8208;chlorinated quinolone derivatives. The two&#8208;step C&#8208;H functionalization/borylation&#8208;chlorination reaction sequence resulted in various C8&#8208;Cl quinolones in good yields. Conversion to C8&#8208;OH, C8&#8208;NH2 and C8&#8208;Ar substituted quinolones was also feasible using this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradation of penicillinic antibiotics and &#946;&#8208;lactamase enzymatic catalysis in a biomimetic Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat bacterial infections. However, their use has been somehow limited given the emergence of bacteria with resistance mechanisms, such as &#946;&#8208;lactamases, which inactivate them by degrading their four membered beta&#8208;lactam&#160;rings.&#160;So, a total knowledge of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamases is required. Here, we report a novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, 1), possessing functional channels capable to accommodate and interact with antibiotics, which catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the penicillinic antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone. In particular, MOF 1 degrades, very efficiently, the four membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic, and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. Combined single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies and density functional (DFT) calculations offer unique snapshots on the host guest&#8208;interactions established between amoxicillin and the functional channels of 1. This allows to propose a degradation mechanism based on the activation of a water molecule, promoted by a Zn&#8208;bridging hydroxyl group, concertedly to the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl moiety and the cleaving of C&#8208;N bond of the lactam ring.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of carbon centered radical generation from alkyl alcohols mediated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene salts has been explored computationally for 7 different NHCs. The influence of the electronic properties for each mechanistic step is rationalized and has been proven to be key for reactivity.







Abstract
Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in&#8197;situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalyst to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remain underexplored. Herein, a DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrates that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterizes how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.

         <title>Constructing pH&#8208;Responsive and Tunable Azo&#8208;Phenol&#8208;Based o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups can be attached to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) group to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. One of the photocages in this study, NPdiCl, is identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.







Abstract
Multiple triggered&#8208;release strategies are widely utilized to control the release of caged target molecules. Among them, photocages with conditional triggers provide extra layers of control in photorelease. In this work, a series of pH&#8208;responsive photocages was designed that could be triggered under irradiation and specific intracellular pH values. pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups were conjugated with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. These azo&#8208;phenol&#8208;based oNB photocages showed differentiable photoreleasing profiles at pH&#8197;5.0, 7.2 and 9.0. By attaching fluorogenic cargos, it was shown that one of the photocages, NPdiCl, could be used to differentiate between acidic pH&#8197;5.0 and neutral pH&#8197;7.2 in cells under artificial pH conditions. Finally, NPdiCl was identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.

         <title>Comparison of Antiaromatic Properties in a Series of Structurally Isomeric Naphthothiophene&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work compares six antiaromatic naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers through computational methods (NICS&#8208;XY scans) and experimental techniques (NMR, UV&#8208;vis, CV, and SC&#8208;XRD).







Abstract
Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV&#8208;vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional material (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8, which has a step&#8208;like dielectric phase transition at 383&#8197;K/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and excellent photoelectric properties, was obtained by using rigid benzylammonium cations as templates.







Abstract
Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS). However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature. The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8 (1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99&#8197;K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34&#8197;eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current (2.12&#215;10&#8722;13&#8197;A), a high on/off ratio (1.77&#215;103), and a fast response (&#964;rise=125&#8197;&#956;s and &#964;decay=419&#8197;&#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.

         <title>Structure&#8208;induced Intelligence of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.

         <title>Expanding the Substrate Scope of Acyltransferase LovD9 for the Biosynthesis of Statin Analogues</title>

         <dc:description>
This study unveils the substrate promiscuity of acyltransferase LovD9, which turns to be very efficient by accepting vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl derivatives as acyl donors for the obtaining of statin analogues.







Abstract
This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9&#8208;catalyzed acylation. While vinyl esters can reach product yields as high as the ones obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethyl butyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved, p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters display a reactivity even higher than DMB&#8208;SMMP for the first acylation step yet the acylation product yield is lower. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated through quantum mechanics (QM) calculations.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Aryl and Alkenyl Halides from Fluorosulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relevance of aryl fluorosulfonates in coupling reactions has increased over the past decade. Surprisingly, the use and synthesis of alkenyl fluorosulfonates is still poorly described. In this paper, the advantageous use of aryl and alkenyl fluorosulfonates instead of the corresponding triflates is reported to synthesize aryl and alkenyl halides using halide salts and commercially available ruthenium catalysts.







Abstract
Aryl and alkenyl halides are widely used as key intermediates in organic synthesis, particularly for the formation of organometallic reagents or as radical precursors. They are also found in pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. In this work, the synthesis of aryl and alkenyl halides from the corresponding fluorosulfonates using commercially available ruthenium catalysts is reported. Notably, this is the first conversion of phenols to aryl halides that is efficient with chloride, bromide, and iodide. Fluorosulfonates are readily prepared using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and less expensive substitutes for triflates. Although aryl fluorosulfonates and their reactions are well known, this is the first report of an efficient coupling of alkenyl fluorosulfonates. To finish, it was demonstrated, by means of representative examples, that the reaction is possible in a one&#8208;pot process, starting directly from phenol or aldehyde.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, organocatalytically achieved polarity reversal of cationic bromine, is presented. The proven bromocation source N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) was converted to a superior bromoanion reagent by H/Br exchange with a secondary amine, substantiated with spectroscopic and computational evidences. The concept has further been used in a successful accelerated organocatalyzed dibromination of olefins in a non&#8208;hazardous, commercially viable process with a wide range of substrate scope. The reactivity of key entities observed through NMR kinetics and reaction acceleration using only 10 mol% of catalyst, account for its major success. The nucleophilicity of the bromoanion was found to be superior in comparison to other nucleophiles such as MeOH, H2O and the protocol dominates over competing allylic bromination reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissymmetric Triaryltriazines: Small Mass Columnar Glasses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Columnar liquid crystals with very small molecular masses that form anisotropic glasses well above room temperature are obtained by mixed dissymmetric substitution of sym&#8208;triazine with ester&#8208;bearing phenyl and phenanthryl or tetrahelicenyl moieties. The combination of low molecular symmetry with configurational flexibility and short polar ester moieties stabilizes the mesophase over large temperature ranges and induces pronounced calorimetric glass transitions within the anisotropic fluid despite the smallness of the molecules. In contrast to more symmetrical homologs, no ester tails longer than ethyl are necessary to induce the liquid crystalline state, allowing for the near&#8208;absence of any insulating and weight&#8208;increasing alkyl periphery. Films drop&#8208;cast from solution show in all cases emission spectra that do not show significant change of fluorescence emission upon annealing, indicating that the columnar hexagonal mesoscopic order is obtained directly upon deposition from solution and is resistant to crystallization upon annealing.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Magnetic Relaxations of Cyano&#8208;Bridged {DyIIIMoV} Systems by Tuning the N&#8208;Sites in &#946;&#8208;diketone Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8722;4f molecular nanomagnets have re&#8208;called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they bring more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} systems, four&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketone ligands bearing different substitution N&#8208;sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL1), 1,3&#8208;Bis(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL2), 1&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL3) and 1,3&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL4). By reacting with DyCl3&#183;6H2O and K4Mo(CN)8&#183;2H2O,&#160;four cyano&#8208;bridged complexes, namely {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL1)2(H2O)3]}&#183;6H2O (1), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL2)(H2O)3(CH3OH)]}2&#183;2CH3OH&#183;3H2O (2), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8]3(HL3)(H2O)2(CH3OH)]&#183;H2O}n&#160;(3) and {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL4)2(H2O)3]}&#183;2H2O&#183;CH3OH (4) were obtained. Structural analyses revealed that&#160;1&#160;and&#160;4&#160;are binuclear complexes,&#160;2&#160;has a tetragonal structure, and&#160;3&#160;exhibits a stair&#8208;like polymer chain structure. The DyIII&#160;ions in all complexes have eight&#8208;coordinated configurations with the coordination spheres DyO7N1&#160;for&#160;1&#160;and&#160;4, DyO6N2&#160;for&#160;2, and DyO5N3&#160;for&#160;3. Magnetic measurements indicated that&#160;1&#160;is a zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) and complexes&#160;2&#8722;4&#160;are field&#8208;induced SMMs, with complex&#160;4&#160;featuring a two&#8208;step relaxation process. The magnetic characterizations and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations revealed that changing the N&#8208;sites in the&#160;&#946;&#8208;diketone ligands can effectively alter the structures and magnetic properties of cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8722;4f nanomagnets by adjusting the coordination environments of the DyIII&#160;centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;precise Dicationic Tetraboranes: Syntheses, Structures and Rearrangement to a Alkylidene Borate&#8208;Borenium Zwitterion and a 1,3&#8208;Azaborinine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes, featuring an electron&#8208;precise tetraboron chain, were synthesized and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases give rise to different outcomes according to the conditions employed, including: 1) reduction and rearrangement of the tetraborane chain to give a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium species; 2) cleavage of the tetraborane chain to afford a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine; and 3) reduction of the supporting ligands to provide a diamino dipotassium salt. The zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium can be viewed as an analogue of the base&#8208;stabilized diborenes. NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a highly polarized B&#8208;B bond in the zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8208;borenium, in which the formal oxidation states can be considered as &#8722;1 and +2. These results suggest the considerable potential of tetraboranes as synthons for novel low&#8208;valent boron species.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photophysical Properties of Aza&#8208;BODIPYs in the Near&#8208;InfraRed Region by Introducing Electron&#8208;Donating Thiophene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the synthesis, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of new bis&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted azaboron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes substituting by different electron donating groups connected to the aza&#8208;BODIPY core through a thiophene unit. In line with theoretical calculations, experimental measurements point out the positive impact of the thiophene group that behave as a secondary donor group leading to an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer process in comparison to previously reported aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. This heterocycle has also been found to tune the oxidative potential and to stabilize the electro&#8208;generated species.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was observed and analyzed for the first time in detail in this work. Although the hexagonal packing aggregation of CD&#8208;based polyrotaxane is a well known phenomena, corresponding studies in terms of rotaxanes without any polymer structure have not been conducted so far, probably owing to the difficulty of the molecular design. Meanwhile, we synthesized a series of [3]rotaxane species via a urea&#8208;end&#8208;capping method and evaluated their aggregation behavior by XRD and SEM measurements. As a result, [3]rotaxane species containing native CD rings showed clear signals assigned to the hexagonal packing by XRD measurement as well as polyrotaxane, proved their aggregation capability. Since the corresponding per&#8208;acetylated derivatives did not show this aggregation behavior, the driving force of this aggregation was suggested to be hydrogen bond formation among CD units. The effect of axle end structures and partial acetylation of CDs were also studied.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Fast Circularly Polarized Luminescence in 2&#8208;Coordinate Chiral Mechanochromic Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of chiral mechanochromic copper(I) cAAC (cAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes with a variety of amide ligands have been studied with regard to their photophysical and chiroptical properties to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships for the design of efficient triplet exciton emitters exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Depending on the environment, which determines the excited state energies, either thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from 1/3LLCT states or phosphorescence from 3LLCT/LC states occurs. However, neither chiral moieties at the carbene nor at the carbazolate ligands provide detectable luminescence dissymmetries glum. An exception is [Cu(phenoxazinyl)(cAAC)], showing orange to deep red TADF with &#955;max = 601&#8208;715 nm in solution, powders and in PMMA. In this case, the amide ligand can undergo distortions in the excited state. This design motif leads to the first linear, non&#8208;aggregated CPL&#8208;active copper(I) complex with glum of &#8208;3.4&#183;10&#8208;3 combined with a high radiative rate constant of 6.7&#183;105 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two new &#8208;COOH functionalized MOFs of composition [M6O4(OH)6(PMA)2(H2PMA)] &#183; x H2O, M = Zr, Hf), denoted CAU&#8208;61, synthesized using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA), a tetracarboxylic acid, as the linker and acetic acid as the solvent. The structure was determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data and one dimensional inorganic building units are connected through tetracarboxylate as well as dicarboxylate linker molecules, resulting in highly stable microporous framework structures with limiting and maximum pore diameter of ~3.6 and ~5.0 &#197;, respectively, lined with &#8208;COOH groups. Thermal stabilities of up to 400 &#176;C in air, chemical stability in water at pH 1 to 12 and water uptake of 17 mol/mol prompted us to study the proton exchange of the &#181;2&#8208;OH, &#181;3&#8208;OH of the IBU and &#8208;COOH groups of the linker by titration with LiOH. Comparison of the pKa values with three UiO&#8208;66 derivatives confirms distinct pKa value ranges and trends for the different acidic protons. Furthermore, the preparation of Zr&#8208;CAU&#8208;61 membranes and first results on permeation of dyes and ions in aqueous solutions are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Performance of CsPbIBr2 Perovskite Solar Cell by Modified Zinc Oxide Nanorods Array with [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 Butyric Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PBCA) is introduced to modify ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRs) electron transport layer to reduce surface defects, ameliorate the morphology of perovskite film, enhance charge extraction properties, and improve the photovoltaic performance of CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Although Metal oxide ZnO is widely used as electron transport layers in all&#8208;inorganic PSCs due to high electron mobility, high transmittance, and simple preparation processing, the surface defects of ZnO suppress the quality of perovskite film and inhibit the solar cells&#8217; performance. In this work, [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PCBA) modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) is employed as electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells. The resulting perovskite film coated on the zinc oxide nanorods has better crystallinity and uniformity, facilitating charge carrier transportation, reducing recombination losses, and ultimately improving the cells&#8217; performance. The perovskite solar cell with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO nanorods/PCBA/CsPbIBr2/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au delivers a high short circuit current density of 11.83&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and power conversion efficiency of 12.05&#8201;%.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;Bridged Bisbutatrienes as Models for Longer Cumulenes: Various Transformations for the Construction of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of longer cumulenes for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has received considerable interest. Recently conjugated bisbutatrienes have been evaluated as mimics of a longer cumulene. In this research, the hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes were synthesized. They underwent various cyclizations to construct fulvene, pentalene, germacycle, benzocyclobutene, and cyclooctatetraene frameworks.







Abstract
Cumulenes have attracted considerable attention due to their unique structural and electronic properties. Despite their high potential for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, the synthetic utility of longer cumulenes remains to be established owing to their inherently high reactivity. Conjugated bisbutatrienes having two cumulene moieties linked by a spacer as a mimic of a longer cumulene were evaluated. Here, the synthesis and characterization of hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes are described. These bisbutatrienes underwent various cyclizations, to construct the unique &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks inaccessible by other methodologies. The bisbutatrienes were converted into fulvenes, pentalene, germacycle, and benzocyclobutene under various conditions. Furthermore, a cyclooctatetraene derivative was synthesized by a one&#8208;step dimerization of the bisbutatriene.

         <title>Defluorination of Fluorophenols by a Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Species: Observation of a New Intermediate Along the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study on a biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species in reaction with halophenols gives efficient dehalogenation including defluorination in the product. Along the reaction mechanism a novel intermediate is characterized spectroscopically and assigned to be an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo adduct.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are versatile oxidants in the biotransformation of various substrates by metalloenzymes and catalyze essential reactions for human health as well as in the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants in the environment. Herein, we report a biomimetic system that efficiently reacts with halophenols through defluorination reactions and characterize various short&#8208;lived intermediates along the reaction mechanism. We study the reactivity pattern of a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species with a series of trihalophenols (X=F, Cl, Br). A combined experimental and computational study reveals that the oxidative dehalogenation of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenol is initiated with an H&#8208;atom abstraction from the phenolic group by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species resulting in the formation of a phenolate radical and an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species. This iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species forms an adduct with the oxidized substrate with &#955;max at 558&#8197;nm which subsequently decays to give quinones as products.

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Like Supramolecular Polymers with Dual Motion Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion patterns for traditional muscle&#8208;like supramolecular polymers are confined to unitary direction, much distinct from the natural muscle movement. Herein, we reported a supramolecular polymer possessing with dual motion patterns.







Abstract
Benefiting from the features like polymeric linear structures, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic adaptiveness, supramolecular polymers (SPs) are favored as exploiting muscle&#8208;like materials, allowing for imitating the muscle functions. However, a substantial part of these materials barely owned an unitary motion orientation while it was obviously known that muscle movements involved distinct orientations. Herein, M1 holding the structure of 44&#8208;membered macrocycle with two aldehyde groups was designed, meanwhile, M2 comprising of secondary ammonium ions, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups as well as the alkyl chains was fabricated, for which it could be assembled with M1 to generate SPs based on host&#8211;guest interactions from a large macrocycle and two secondary ammonium ions. SPs underwent vertical compression upon the addition of N2H4 owing to the forming dynamic covalent bonds, notably, mechanically interlocked structures were also generated. Afterwards, the vertically compressed SPs experienced horizontal shrinkage when tetrabutylammonium chloride was contributed due to the destruction of host&#8211;guest interactions.

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;Gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzidine&#8208;type wide&#8208;gap materials are designed in order to access green processing techniques, via functionalization with solubilizing pendant groups. Flexible thin films and organic electronic devices are then prepared from low&#8208;toxic solvent such as alcohols or o&#8208;xylenes.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208; and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material's solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150&#8197;mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33&#8197;cm&#215;2&#8197;cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4&#8197;V) presented by organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For preparation of particle size libraries of products with low solubility constants, a new reaction&#8208;diffusion method is presented through the example of a catalytically valuable Prussian Blue analogue. The particle size analyses of the Liesegang Patterns forming via &#8216;dormant&#8217; citrate complex show the method produces libraries of differently sized products in each band. The new method can be expanded into other PBAs and 2D diffusion systems.







Abstract
Liesegang patterns that develop as a result of reaction&#8208;diffusion can simultaneously form products with slightly different sizes spatially separated in a single medium. We show here a reaction&#8208;diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different&#8208;sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel&#8208;embedded particles are still catalytically active. Finally, the applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.

         <title>Boosting Methanol&#8208;Mediated CO2 Hydrogenation into Aromatics by Synergistically Tailoring Oxygen Vacancy and Acid Site Properties of Multifunctional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistically tailoring oxygen vacancy and acid site properties of multifunctional catalyst composed of Cr2O3 and H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 guarantees the superior aromatics synthesis performance of CO2 hydrogenation in a single&#8208;pass. The structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components is well established to boost aromatics synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation.







Abstract
Even though the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics has been realized via a methanol&#8208;mediated pathway and multifunctional catalyst, few works have been focused on the simultaneously rational design of each component in multifunctional catalyst to improve the performance. Also, the structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components (reducible metal oxide and acidic zeolite) has been rarely investigated. Herein, we increase the oxygen vacancy (Ov) density in reducible Cr2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Thanks to the enriched Ov, Cr2O3&#8208;based catalyst affords high methanol selectivity of 98.1&#8201;% (without CO) at a CO2 conversion of 16.8&#8201;% under high reaction temperature (350&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, after combining with the acidic zeolite H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, the multifunctional catalyst realizes the direct conversion of CO2 into aromatics with conversion and selectivity as high as 25.4&#8201;% and 80.1&#8201;% (without CO), respectively. The property of acid site in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, especially the Al species that located at the intersection of straight and sinusoidal channels, plays a vital role in enhancing the aromatics selectivity, which can be precisely controlled by varying the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Our work provides a synergistic strategy to boost the aromatics synthesis performance from CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Thienyl&#8208;Substituted Diboranes(4): Electronic Stabilization of Radicals Versus Increased Reactivity towards Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thienyl substituents at a diborane(4) provide a mixture of steric flexibility, &#963;&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing and mesomeric effects, which enable the stabilization of a highly delocalized diboron radical anion, as well as an increased reactivity towards bond activation and rearrangement reactions upon Lewis&#8208;base coordination and two&#8208;electron reduction.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron&#8208;rich low oxidation state main group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2&#8208;thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides a platform for both radical anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithienyldiborane(4) (1) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8722;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. The facile one&#8208;electron reduction of 1 yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2&#8208;dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two&#8208;electron reduction of 1 with magnesium anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8722;B bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;5&#8208;diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;5&#8208;borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight both the structural and electronic changes in the boron&#8208;substituted heterocyclic C4B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).

&lt;p&gt;Low-valent main group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron-rich low oxidation state main group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2-thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides a platform for both radical anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2-dimesityl-1,2-dithienyldiborane(4) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8722;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. The facile one-electron reduction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2-dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two-electron reduction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with magnesium anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8722;B bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene)RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight both the structural and electronic changes in the boron-substituted heterocyclic C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Self&#8208;Assembly and Applications of Metal&#8211;Organic Molecular Containers with Flexible Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic molecular containers (MOMCs), constructed with flexible backbones, exhibit a unique feature both in the structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the functional groups in the skeletons. This Review focuses on the recent development of flexible MOMCs from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications, which remains a fertile ground for opportunity and creativity.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has become an interdisciplinary discipline of chemistry, physics, and biology. As a huge subunit of supramolecular compounds, the functional metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems with well&#8208;defined cavities which are able to accommodate size&#8208;suitable guests via benign host&#8208;guest behavior, have been known as &#8220;metal&#8211;organic molecular containers&#8221; (MOMCs) and attracted much attentions for their rich chemical properties and wide potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, bio&#8208;medical and other fields. In particular, the MOMCs with flexible backbones exhibit a unique feature both in the aspect of structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the specific functional groups in the skeletons. In this paper, we review several selected examples of the coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications. The self&#8208;assembly strategies, especially the different choice of organic ligands with flexible backbones during the construction, leading to quite diverse configurations compared to the rigid ligands, have been also discussed to show a different perspective of metal&#8211;organic system construction.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental/theoretical investigations link the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, which are key in organic electronics. the first cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units was synthesized and studied. Comparison of the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties with those of a shorter analogue highlights the key role played by the hoop size. Corresponding cycloparaphenylenes with eight and ten phenyl units were also compared. Notably the saturated field effect mobility of the five&#8208;unit cyclocarbazole is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue.







Abstract
In the field of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a strong impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and study of the first example of a cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. In particular, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22&#215;10&#8722;5 vs 1.04&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). However, the study of the other organic field&#8208;effect transistor characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules in thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.

         <title>18F&#8208;Labeling Chemistry in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct incorporation of 18F into target molecules of interest in aqueous media has many practical advantages. This paper classifies the atoms that form covalent bonds with fluorine and reviews the existing methods for 18F&#8208;labeling in aqueous media. Additionally, some 18F&#8208;labeling mechanisms are explained.







Abstract
18F&#8208;Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. The preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled molecular tracers involves critical steps such as the 18F&#8208;labeling reaction, work&#8208;up, and 18F&#8208;product purification, which are governed by 18F&#8208;labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of 18F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this Review summarizes the existing 18F&#8208;labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. The Review is focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [18F]F&#8722; as the 18F source has been mainly discussed.
