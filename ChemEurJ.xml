         <dc:description>Selective Detection of H  2  S in cellular system using fluorescent CPs/MOFs is of great scientific interest due to their outstanding aqueous stability, biocompatibility and real&#8208;time detection ability.&#160; Fabrication of such materials using complete biologically essential elements and applying them as an efficient biosensors is still quite challenging. &#160;In this context, we present two newly synthesized CPs containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) and nitro/azido functional group on the framework to sense extracellular and intracellular H  2  S by reducing into respective amines. &#160;The CP&#8208;  1 containing the azide group acted as an efficient fluorencent turn&#8208;on probe with lowest detection limit (7.2 &#181;M) and shortest response time (30 sec) among the Zn&#8208;based probes reported till date.&#160; Moreover, CP&#8208;1 exhibited green luminescence in live cells after imaging very low concentration of H  2  S, while the nitro analogue, CP&#8208;2, couldn&#8217;t detect the target analyte due to it&#8217;s framework disruption.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>

Direct action: A highly stereoselective glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages is disclosed, which employs a combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent and exploits glycosidation via glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. A variety of natural saponins containing (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan motifs are thus synthesized in convergent manner by direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors.







Abstract
Conventional syntheses of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement for a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here, a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG is disclosed; it employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with 12 (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and 13 alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative, naturally occurring triterpene saponins were thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicated that this glycosylation proceeds by SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8722;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species that activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8722; ensures an uninterruptive role for the glycosidation.

         <title>Rhodium and Iridium Complexes of Anionic Thione and Selone Ligands Derived from Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taken under its wing: Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal, inter alia, their ability to develop secondary arene&#8208;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands.







Abstract
The lithium salts of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones and selones [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}Li(toluene)] (1: E=S; 2: E=Se; WCA=B(C6F5)3, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which contain a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety in the imidazole backbone were reacted with Me3SiCl, to furnish the silylated adducts (WCA&#8208;IDipp)ESiMe3 (3: E=S; 4: E=Se). The reaction of the latter with [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)MCl2]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the rhodium(III) and iridium(III) half&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}MCl(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)] (5&#8211;8). The direct reaction of the lithium salts 1 and 2 with a half or a full equivalent of [M(COD)Cl]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the monometallic complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M(COD)] (9&#8211;12) or the bimetallic complexes [&#956;2&#8208;{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M2(COD)2(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)] (13&#8211;16), respectively. The bonding situation in these complexes has been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing thiolate or selenolate ligand character with negligible metal&#8208;chalcogen &#960;&#8208;interaction.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial proteases able to hydrolyze insoluble proteins in the presence of surfactants remains essential for their structural characterization. Therefore, we report for the first time metal&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate complexes (M&#8208;K 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 where M = Zr(IV) or Hf(IV)) as catalysts for the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein, zein, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) via a competitive binding mechanism, which results in a dependence of the hydrolysis on the surfactant concentration.







Abstract
Despite the enormous importance of insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] (M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein.

     alt="Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The development of artificial&lt;/b&gt; proteases able to hydrolyze insoluble proteins in the presence of surfactants remains essential for their structural characterization. Therefore, we report for the first time metal-substituted Keggin-type polyoxometalate complexes (M-K 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 where M = Zr(IV) or Hf(IV)) as catalysts for the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein, zein, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) via a competitive binding mechanism, which results in a dependence of the hydrolysis on the surfactant concentration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the enormous importance of insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme-like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) substituted Keggin-type polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[M(&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in ternary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacially Super&#8208;Assembled Benzimidazole Derivative&#8208;Based Mesoporous Silica Nanoprobe for Sensitive Copper (II) Detection and Biosensing in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique mesoporous silica nanoprobe (DHBM&#8208;MSN) based on benzimidazole derivative is constructed for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. The designed DHBM&#8208;MSN has obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solution with extremely low detection limit. The detection system is successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice and live cells. The results indicate that DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with benzimidazole&#8208;derived fluorescent molecules (DHBM) are fabricated via a feasible interfacial superassembly strategy for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. DHBM&#8208;MSN exhibits an obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solutions, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;M. The DHBM&#8208;MSN solid&#8208;state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that nanocarriers with different morphologies do not affect the specific detectionability. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental results and density function theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. These results indicate that the DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Oximes to Hydroxylamines: Current Methods, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to access hydroxylamine derivatives? Likely, one of the most straightforward strategy involves the catalytic reduction of oximes. These substrates are however difficult to reduce selectively as overeduction breaks their weak N&#8722;O bond giving primary amines instead. The few different capable catalytic systems are overviewed in this minireview as well as new opportunities for advancing the research field are suggested.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8722;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the E/Z&#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Photosynthetic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to emulate functions of the native photosynthetic apparatus by artificial systems are introduced. One approach involves the integration of native photosynthetic systems with artificial materials onto electrode surfaces to yield photobioelectrochemical cells. A second approach involves the assembly of supramolecular photosensitizer/electron acceptor assemblies leading to the efficient light&#8208;induced formational of election&#8208;transfer redox products. A third approach addresses the design of dynamic networks stimulating controlled electron&#8208;transfer processes leading to the formation of fuel products under thermodynamically&#8208;guided or out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.







Abstract
Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents recent advances towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid/electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.

Recent progress in water&#8208;dispersible gold nanoclusters in terms of their synthesis strategies, optical properties, and bio&#8208;applications is discussed. Different synthesis strategies for water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs are highlighted. The progress achieved in the optical properties and biological applications of these molecules is also reviewed.

Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. Intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels have endowed them with fascinating electronic and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the fields of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, biochemical sensing, bio&#8208;imaging, and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most AuNCs are synthesized in organic solvents and do not disperse in aqueous solutions; this restricts their biological applications. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs and their biological applications. We first review different methods of synthesis, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic AuNCs. We then discuss their photophysical properties, such as emission enhancement and fluorescence lifetimes. Next, we summarize their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outline the challenges and potential for the future development of these AuNCs.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Cell Adhesions by Using Bipolar Nanoelectrode Array</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method for fast and positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed using oxygen as the electrochemical probe. The successful imaging is achieved by transient generation of difference in oxygen concentration over the nanoelectrodes covered with or without cells. Thus, cell morphology and adhesion strength can be imaged.







Abstract
A label&#8208;free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving voltage of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V is applied to in&#8197;situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1&#8197;V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label&#8208;free imaging of single cells.

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Cu nanosheets array support structure was provided as the substrate of organic photocathode, which provides more reactive sites and increases the effective light absorption area. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu NSA increases the distribution range of the built&#8208;in electric field, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the photocatalytic performance. The proposal of the simple support structure provides a direction for the design and implementation of spatially separated PEC cell.







Abstract
The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carrier separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced a copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50&#8197;mV to 0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and co&#8208;catalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14&#8201;% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathodes.

         <title>Merging of a Perylene Moiety Enables a RuII Photosensitizer with Long&#8208;Lived Excited States and the Efficient Production of Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two are better than one: In a joint study, groups in two laboratories at TU Braunschweig and Ulm University present a novel bichromophoric RuII complex. This unique photosensitizer was obtained by fusing a ruthenium polypyridine chromophore with an additional perylene dye. This photosensitizer exhibits a strong absorptivity in the visible region and an enhanced excited state lifetime of 8&#8197;&#956;s. In addition, this complex enables the efficient production of singlet oxygen. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Rau, S. Tschierlei, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103609).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interdisciplinary character of the Horizon2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;EJD TubInTrain project allowed a challenging study of the peculiarity of maytansinoids as tubulin binders. The enthusiasm of PhD students proved fundamental for productively merging synthesis, biological evaluation, X&#8208;ray crystallography and docking studies. The good agreement of computational and experimental sheds further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and provides a solid foundation for the future design, synthesis and analysis of next&#8208;generation maytansinoids.

         <dc:description>Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes with tertiary amines take place in the presence of catalytic amounts of TiBn 4 , Ph 3 C[B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ], and a sterically demanding aminopyridinato ligand precursor.

         <title>Tunable surface electric field of electrode materials via constructing Schottky heterojunctions for selective conversion of trash ions to treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytically conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reaction. Here, we introduce a concept&#8208;new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and NO  x  &#8208;  reduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback. Due to the increased awareness of the chemical waste impact on the environment, synthetic studies have been driven by the goal of finding non&#8208;toxic reagents. The main focus of this review is to highlight recent methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired transformations to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are reported. An important biosynthetic transformation mediated by &#946;&#8208;glycosidase were replaced with a simple removal of the silyl group from designed strictosidine aglycone silyl ether derivatives. Subsequent bioinspired transformations under substrate control resulted in the concise and divergent total syntheses of heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids.







Abstract
A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8722;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8722;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13&#8197;steps.

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three equivalents of heteroallene can be captured between the Si&#8722;P bonds of Zintl&#8208;derived clusters. Silyl coordination at either the nitrogen or chalcogen of the heteroallene can be controlled by tuning the groups on the silyl moiety or functional groups at the heteroallene. It was also found that one captured small molecule can be exchanged for another, evidencing small molecule catch and release at these clusters.







Abstract
Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P7(SiR3)3) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.

         <title>Utilisation of CO2 as &#8220;Structure Modifier&#8221; of Inorganic Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is abundant and free but environmentally unfriendly. It is also unreactive, hence re&#8208;purposing can be a challenge. This research article describes how CO2 can be used as a useful reagent towards the preparation and/or chemical and structural modification of inorganic solids. This approach is of wide application hence, in the future, it may become part of a toolbox of methods to reduce the environmental impact of CO2.







Abstract
Utilisation of CO2 as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule's inherent chemical stability. However, CO2 reacts promptly at high temperature (&#8764;1000&#8201;&#176;C) with alkaline&#8208;earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re&#8208;utilisation. In this work, this concept is extended and CO2 is utilised as a reagent to modify the crystal structure of mixed&#8208;metal inorganic solids. Modification of the crystal structure is a &#8220;tool&#8221; used by materials scientists to tailor the physical property of solids. CO2 gas was reacted with several isostructural mixed&#8208;metal oxides Sr2CuO3, Sr1.8Ba0.2CuO3 and Ba2PdO3. These oxides are carefully selected to show anion vacancies in their crystal structure, to act as host sites for CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of carbonate anions, (CO3)2&#8722;. The corresponding oxide carbonates were formed successfully and the favourable formation of SrCO3 as secondary phase was minimised via an innovative, yet simple synthetic procedure involving alternating of CO2 and air. We also derived a simple model to predict the kinetics of the reactions for the cuprates, using first&#8208;principles density functional theory and assimilating the reaction to a gas&#8208;surface process.

         <title>Properties of Single&#8208;Component Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) were produced, where the materials contained a crystalline and glass phase from the same parent zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF): ZIF&#8208;62(Zn). The composites displayed thermal and adsorptive properties present in both the original crystalline and glass materials and interfacial compatibility between the two phases was evident. A mixed&#8208;metal Co/Zn analogue was also produced to further examine phase&#8208;mixing.







Abstract
The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF&#8208;62(Zn) was incorporated within an agZIF&#8208;62(Zn) matrix. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of agZIF&#8208;62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed&#8208;metal (ZIF&#8208;62(Co))0.5(agZIF&#8208;62(Zn))0.5 analogue. CO2 gas adsorption measurements showed that the CO2 uptakes of the MOF&#8208;CGCs were between those of the crystalline and glassy phases.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It depends how you look at it: By exploring randomly formed domains of microcrystalline finasteride dispersed in a KCl pellet with the spatial resolution of 0.1&#8197;mm granted by synchrotron source, we noticed that anisotropic ECDi (ACD) spectra might be very different from the emergent solid&#8208;state ECD spectrum recorded on a commercial instrument, which is similar to the solution ECD. Consequently, we got an exclusive insight into the critical role played by local domains.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ECD (ss&#8208;ECD) spectra of a model microcrystalline solid, finasteride, dispersed into a KCl pellet were recorded by using the synchrotron radiation source at the Diamond B23 beamline. Scanning a surface of 36&#8197;mm2 with a step of 0.5&#8197;mm, we measured a set of ECD imaging (ECDi) spectra very different from each other and from the ss&#8208;ECD recorded with a bench&#8208;top instrument (1&#8197;cm2 area). This is due to the anisotropic part of the ECD (ACD), which averages to zero in solution or on a large number of randomly oriented crystallites, but can otherwise be extremely large. Two&#8208;way singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, through experimental and simulated TDDFT spectra, disclosed that the measured and theoretical principal components are in line with each other. This finding demonstrates that the observed isotropic ss&#8208;ECD spectrum is governed by the anisotropy of locally oriented crystals. It also introduces a new quality for ss&#8208;ECD measurements and opens a new future for probing and mapping chiral materials in the solid state such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photodynamics of the methylated isomer, N1&#8208;methylpseudouridine (m1&#968;), which is commonly used in mRNA therapeutics were investigated alongside the canonical base uridine; m1&#968; was found to have a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield than uridine. However, following UVC irradiation m1&#968; is shown to be ca. 6.7&#8197;times more photostable than uridine.







Abstract
N1&#8208;Methylation of pseudouridine (m1&#968;) replaces uridine (Urd) in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m1&#968; is compared to that of uridine by using photoirradiation at 267&#8197;nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m1&#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both molecules decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m1&#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than Urd following irradiation at 267&#8197;nm.

         <title>Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active Photochromic Phenanthrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of photochromic phenanthrene derivatives bearing pyridine or pyridinium units have been synthetized and characterized by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the different substitution positions yield to a drastic difference on the photo and electrochromic properties of these systems. These compounds derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds show good qualities for the applications in optoelectronic devices, as opto&#8208;transistors or in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
A phenanthrene unit has been functionalized by several methylthiophene units in order to bring it a photochromic behavior. These compounds were characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies, theoretical calculations as well as cyclic voltammetry. The association of a phenanthrene group with a photochromic center could open the door to a new generation of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium, the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide, the aluminium bis(hydrogensulfide), the six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide as well as a rare five&#8208;membered heterocyclic aluminium sulfide were synthesized controllably in mild manners. Reactions of the known dihydridoaluminium and the terphenyl dihydridoaluminium with various thiation reagents formed a series of aluminium&#8208;sulfur species. This provided insights into the influence of the supporting ligands on the reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions owing to limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (1) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium 1Tipp, 1 features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide 2, the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 4 and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 6 to be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8722;S&#8722;P five&#8208;membered ring (7) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Coordination Cage&#8208;Based Emulsifiers: Templated Formation of Metal Oxide Microcapsules Monitored by In Situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles captured in action: Non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly of heteroleptic coordination cages results in Gemini amphiphiles, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions. Serving as water&#8208;free medium, the emulsion&#8208;templated synthesis of metal oxide microcapsules from water&#8208;sensitive precursors can be carried out in controlled fashion. The formation of hollow metal oxide microcapsules was visualized by in&#8197;situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping.







Abstract
Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (CGA&#8208;3; CGA=Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques. In situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of p&#8208;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>

         <dc:description>Cu  2  O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, while serious electron&#8208;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement of the PEC activity. In this work, CeO  2  nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the Cu  2  O octahedra surface, successfully constructing Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in which p&#8208;n heterojunction and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) structure work together. The optimum Cu  2  O/CeO  2  composite without the use of any cocatalyst exhibits 5 times higher photocurrent density (4.63 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu  2  O octahedra, which is better than most Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with the advanced Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu  2  O/CeO  2  (Faradaic efficiency of ~100%) is 17.5 times higher than that of pure Cu  2  O octahedra and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12 h stability test. The delicately designed Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;  iso  &#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesised and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 3  10  helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1 nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;-amino-  iso  -butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesised and studied. X-ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N-terminal azide and a C-terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 3  10  helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#945;-methylvaline (L-&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality.

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reactions between fluoroalkenes and silyl ketene acetals gave vinylic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;functionalized products under mild and simple conditions. Carboboration reaction of fluoroalkenes generates an oxygen&#8208;stabilized silylium ion to facilitate the C&#8722;F bond cleavage. DFT and IBO studies were performed to clear the reaction mechanism. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes due to the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity.







Abstract
Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8722;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8722;F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8722;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8722;F bond of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8722;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8722;F bond transformation.

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plus side of amyloids? Peptide amyloids have an inherent templating ability that underlies the infectivity and progression of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases as well as guiding the synthesis of melanin. Such amyloid&#8208;based templating has been shown to support the sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective addition of amino acids to a complementary peptide chain. Here we report that the templating nature of amyloids also supports the autocatalytic self&#8208;replication of peptides. The relevance to a prebiotic role for amyloids is discussed.







Abstract
The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable both of self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, no plausible prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids, we present two systems in which the products of a peptide&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.

In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a newly&#8208;built discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy.

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive  Monobridged Ge(&#181; &#8208;H)GeH Molecule via Non&#8208;Adiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH (X  1  A') molecule was prepared in gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium (Ge) with germane (GeH  4  ). Merged with electronic structure calculations, this reaction was revealed to commence on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond via a submerged barrier forming the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH  3  ); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH  3  predominantly isomerized via two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H  2  GeGe) and di&#8208;bridged (Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H  2  )Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of&#160;the cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C  2  H  2  surface, deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing non&#8208;classical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8211;stabilized perfluorinated palladium cages catalyze the additive&#8211;free aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8211;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8211;Pd  2+  coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8211;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd  2+  to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O  2  for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H  2  transfer to alkynes, which normally prevents from observing parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP). Nevertheless, specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled detection of important HCAT&#8208;alkyne&#8208;H  2  intermediates via substantial  1  H,  11  B and  15  N signal enhancements and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Field Induced Mass Transfer: New Insight into Nano&#8208;electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17726-17735, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocatalysts proves to be a promising way of promoting the performance of electrocatalytic reactions. In this Concept, we provide a brief review of the recent progress of new physics in nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, that is, local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer (LMT), and highlight new insights into LMT in the future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Unravelling the complex kinetics of electrocatalysis is essential for the design of electrocatalysts with high performance. Mass transfer and electron transfer are two primary factors that need to be optimized in order to enhance electrocatalytic reactions. The use of nanocatalysts proves to be a promising way of promoting the performance of electrocatalytic reactions, this improvement is usually attributed to their ability to enhance electron transfer. However, when catalysts are taken down to the nanoscale, their size is comparable to the thickness of an electrical double layer, so any curvature can lead to an inhomogeneous local electric field on the electrode, which then changes the mass transfer essentially. In this article, we introduce the new concept of local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer in nano&#8208;electrocatalytic systems, and provide a brief review of recent progress, revealing its effect on nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, which may bring new insight into the future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.

         <title>Comprehensive Mechanism of CO2 Electroreduction on Non&#8208;Noble Metal Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17900-17909, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalyst of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene for CO2 reduction were systematically investigated (see figure). The Cr&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;Mo2CS2 have excellent CO2RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304&#8197;V. Fe&#8208;Mo2CS2 with a nitrogenase&#8208;like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
In this work, a series of non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalysts of Mo2CS2&#8208;MXene for CO2 reduction were systematically investigated by well&#8208;defined density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that nine types of transitional metal (TM) supported Mo2CS2 (TM&#8208;Mo2CS2) are very stable, while eight can effectively inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After comprehensively comparing the changes of free energy for each pathway in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), it is found that the products of TM&#8208;Mo2CS2 are not completely CH4. Furthermore, Cr&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;Mo2CS2 are found to render excellent CO2RR catalytic activity, and their limiting potentials are in the range of 0.245&#8211;0.304&#8197;V. In particular, Fe&#8208;Mo2CS2 with a nitrogenase&#8208;like structure has the lowest limiting potential and the highest electrocatalytic activity. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have also proven that these kinds of single&#8208;atom catalysts with robust performance could exist stably at room temperature. Therefore, these single TM atoms anchored on the surface of MXenes can be profiled as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.

Large versus small: The impact of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] and the behavior of the complexes towards alkynes is presented. It demonstrates how small differences in the stereo&#8208;electronic features of closely related ligands can significantly alter the reactivity pattern. The reaction of (suitable precursors of) both complexes with alkynes gave &#951;2&#8208;(C,C)&#8208;alkyne complexes [Ni(NHC)2](&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)], although the number of complexes available for [Ni(Mes2Im)2] is limited to small alkynes and good acceptor alkynes.







Abstract
A case study on the effect of the employment of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC=iPr2ImMe 1Me, Mes2Im 2) and their behavior towards alkynes is reported. The reaction of a mixture of [Ni2(iPr2ImMe)4(&#956;&#8208;(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2)&#8208;COD)] B/ [Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(&#951;4&#8208;COD)] B&#8217; or [Ni(Mes2Im)2] 2, respectively, with alkynes afforded complexes [Ni(NHC)2(&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)] (NHC=iPr2ImMe: alkyne=MeC&#8801;CMe 3, H7C3C&#8801;CC3H7 4, PhC&#8801;CPh 5, MeOOCC&#8801;CCOOMe 6, Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3 7, PhC&#8801;CMe 8, HC&#8801;CC3H7 9, HC&#8801;CPh 10, HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) 11, HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4) 12, HC&#8801;CCOOMe 13; NHC=Mes2Im: alkyne=MeC&#8801;CMe 14, MeOOCC&#8801;CCOOMe 15, PhC&#8801;CMe 16, HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4) 17, HC&#8801;CCOOMe 18). Unusual rearrangement products 11&#8201;a and 12&#8201;a were identified for the complexes of the terminal alkynes HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) and HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4), 11 and 12, which were formed by addition of a C&#8722;H bond of one of the NHC N&#8208;iPr methyl groups to the C&#8801;C triple bond of the coordinated alkyne. Complex 2 catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of 2&#8208;butyne, 4&#8208;octyne, diphenylacetylene, dimethyl acetylendicarboxylate, 1&#8208;pentyne, phenylacetylene and methyl propiolate at ambient conditions, whereas 1Me is not a good catalyst. The reaction of 2 with 2&#8208;butyne was monitored in some detail, which led to a mechanistic proposal for the cyclotrimerization at [Ni(NHC)2]. DFT calculations reveal that the differences between 1Me and 2 for alkyne cyclotrimerization lie in the energy profile of the initiation steps, which is very shallow for 2, and each step is associated with only a moderate energy change. The higher stability of 3 compared to 14 is attributed to a better electron transfer from the NHC to the metal to the alkyne ligand for the N&#8208;alkyl substituted NHC, to enhanced Ni&#8208;alkyne backbonding due to a smaller CNHC&#8722;Ni&#8722;CNHC bite angle, and to less steric repulsion of the smaller NHC iPr2ImMe.

         <title>Modification of Amorphous Mesoporous Zirconia Nanoparticles with Bisphosphonic Acids: A Straightforward Approach for Tailoring the Surface Properties of the Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17941-17951, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisphosphonic acids provide a straightforward method for the covalent modification of the surface of mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles, with stronger affinity with respect to monophosphonate compounds. The modular synthesis of the bisphosphonic acids based on thio&#8208;Michael addition reaction on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate ester enables the preparation of zirconia nanoparticles with specific functional groups or charges on the surface.







Abstract
The use of readily prepared bisphosphonic acids obtained in few steps through a thio&#8208;Michael addition of commercially available thiols on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate enables the straightforward surface modification of amorphous mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles. Simple stirring of the zirconia nanoparticles in a buffered aqueous solution of the proper bisphosphonic acid leads to the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles with different kinds of functional groups, charge and hydrophobic properties. Formation of both chemisorbed and physisorbed layers of the bisphosphonic acid take place, observing after extensive washing a grafting density of 1.1 molecules/nm2 with negligible release in neutral or acidic pH conditions, demonstrating stronger loading compared to monophosphonate derivatives. The modified nanoparticles were characterized by IR, XPS, &#950;&#8208;potential analysis to investigate the loading of the bisphosphonic acid, FE&#8208;SEM to investigate the size and morphologies of the nanoparticles and 31P and 1H MAS NMR to investigate the coordination motif of the phosphonate units on the surface. All these analytical techniques demonstrated the strong affinity of the bisphosphonic moiety for the Zr(IV) metal centers. The functionalization with bisphosphonic acids represents a straightforward covalent approach for tailoring the superficial properties of zirconia nanoparticles, much straightforward compared the classic use of trisalkoxysilane or trichlorosilane reagents typically employed for the functionalization of silica and metal oxide nanoparticles. Extension of the use of bisphosphonates to other metal oxide nanoparticles is advisable.

         <title>Rhodium Indenyl NHC and Fluorenyl&#8208;Tethered NHC Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Applications in the Catalytic C&#8722;H Borylation of Arenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17824-17833, December 20, 2021. </description>

Indenyl rhodium NHC complexes with labile alkene ligands (ethene and cyclooctene) have been synthesized and shown to be better catalysts than the related fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC rhodium complexes for the C&#8722;H activation and borylation of arenes and alkanes.







Abstract
Indenyl (Ind) rhodium N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes [Rh(&#951;5&#8208;Ind)(NHC)(L)] were synthesised for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIPr) with L=C2H4 (1), CO (2&#8201;a) and cyclooctene (COE; 3), for 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydroimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (SIMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;b) and COE (4), and 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) with L=CO (2&#8201;c) and COE (5). Reaction of SIPr with [Rh(Cp*)(C2H4)2] did not give the desired SIPr complex, thus demonstrating the &#8220;indenyl effect&#8221; in the synthesis of 1. Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3 to 3 proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6) with loss of COE. Tethered&#8208;fluorenyl NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5&#8208;C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxNR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4: 11; L=COE: 12; L=CO: 13; R=Mes, L=COE: 14; L=CO: 15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE: 16; L=CO: 17) were synthesised in low yields (5&#8211;31&#8201;%) in comparison to good yields for the monodentate complexes (49&#8211;79&#8201;%). Compounds 3 and 1, which contain labile alkene ligands, were successful catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene with B2pin2 (Bpin=pinacolboronate, 97 and 93&#8201;% PhBpin respectively with 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst, 24&#8197;h, 80&#8201;&#176;C), with SIPr giving a more active catalyst than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl&#8208;tethered NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product, with smaller amounts of para substitution and almost no ortho product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2 at 120 and 140&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, was monitored by 11B NMR spectroscopy, which showed high conversions into octyl and decylBpin over 4&#8211;7&#8197;days, thus demonstrating catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H borylation with new piano stool rhodium indenyl complexes. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420&#8197;nm light confirmed the ready dissociation of C2H4 and COE ligands, whereas CO complexes were inert. Evidence for C&#8722;H bond activation in the alkyl groups of the NHC ligands was obtained.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indenyl rhodium&lt;/b&gt; NHC complexes with labile alkene ligands (ethene and cyclooctene) have been synthesized and shown to be better catalysts than the related fluorenyl-tethered NHC rhodium complexes for the C&#8722;H activation and borylation of arenes and alkanes.

         <title>Metallodrug Profiling against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Target Proteins Identifies Highly Potent Inhibitors of the S/ACE2 interaction and the Papain&#8208;like Protease PLpro</title>

Despite their increasing relevance in medicinal chemistry, metal complexes are still underrepresented in compound screening libraries for drug discovery. In this work more than 100 metal complexes were evaluated as inhibitors of two targets in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 life cycle, the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and the protease PLpro. The most active inhibitors were studied for antiviral effects in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells and led to the discovery of active compounds that will provide starting points for future drug design.







Abstract
The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has called for an urgent need for dedicated antiviral therapeutics. Metal complexes are commonly underrepresented in compound libraries that are used for screening in drug discovery campaigns, however, there is growing evidence for their role in medicinal chemistry. Based on previous results, we have selected more than 100&#8197;structurally diverse metal complexes for profiling as inhibitors of two relevant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication mechanisms, namely the interaction of the spike (S) protein with the ACE2 receptor and the papain&#8208;like protease PLpro. In addition to many well&#8208;established types of mononuclear experimental metallodrugs, the pool of compounds tested was extended to approved metal&#8208;based therapeutics such as silver sulfadiazine and thiomersal, as well as polyoxometalates (POMs). Among the mononuclear metal complexes, only a small number of active inhibitors of the S/ACE2 interaction was identified, with titanocene dichloride as the only strong inhibitor. However, among the gold and silver containing complexes many turned out to be very potent inhibitors of PLpro activity. Highly promising activity against both targets was noted for many POMs. Selected complexes were evaluated in antiviral SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 assays confirming activity for gold complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or dithiocarbamato ligands, a silver NHC complex, titanocene dichloride as well as a POM compound. These studies might provide starting points for the design of metal&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antiviral agents.

         <title>Development of an Enzyme&#8208;Inhibitor Reaction Using Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II for One&#8208;Pot Megamolecule Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17843-17848, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic retinoid covalent inhibitor that targets the nucleophilic tyrosine residue in cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) in mild conditions was developed. This enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair was integrated into the megamolecule assembly strategy to construct protein scaffolds in one&#8208;pot reactions. Here, three orthogonal enzyme&#8208;inhibitor reactions occurred simultaneously to form a homogeneous product without the use of protecting groups.







Abstract
This paper presents an enzyme building block for the assembly of megamolecules. The system is based on the inhibition of the human&#8208;derived cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) domain. We synthesized a synthetic retinoid bearing an arylfluorosulfate group, which uses sulfur fluoride exchange click chemistry to covalently inhibit CRABP2. We conjugated both the inhibitor and a fluorescein tag to an oligo(ethylene glycol) backbone and measured a second&#8208;order rate constant for the protein inhibition reaction of approximately 3,600&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. We used this new enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair to assemble multi&#8208;protein structures in one&#8208;pot reactions using three orthogonal assembly chemistries to demonstrate exact control over the placement of protein domains within a single, homogeneous molecule. This work enables a new dimension of control over specificity, orientation, and stoichiometry of protein domains within atomically precise nanostructures.

         <title>On the Supra&#8208;LUMO Interaction: Case Study of a Sudden Change of Electronic Structure as a Functional Emergence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17889-17899, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon sudden change of electronic structure (SCES), the doubly&#8208;electrophoric trans conformer of this redox&#8208;active assembly switches into a singly&#8208;superelectrophoric cis conformer on account of the synergistic interplay of electrophilic centers pertaining to the two pyridinium moieties. An extended LUMO (coined as supLUMO) indeed develops through space, which also plays the role of electron reservoir.







Abstract
The synergistic functioning of redox&#8208;active components that emerges from prototypical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl is described. Interestingly, even if a trans conformation of the native assembly is expected, due to electrostatic repulsion between cationic pyridinium units, we demonstrate that cis conformation is equally energy&#8208;stabilized on account of a peculiar LUMO (SupLUMO) that develops through space, encompassing the two pyridiniums in a single, made&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8208;piece, electronic entity (superelectrophoric behavior). This SupLUMO emergence, with the cis species as superelectrophore embodiment, originates in a sudden change of electronic structure. This finding is substantiated by insights from solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and solution (NOE NMR and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemistry) studies, combined with electronic structure computations. Electrochemistry shows that electron transfers are so strongly correlated that two&#8208;electron reduction manifests itself as a single&#8208;step process with a large potential inversion consistent with inner creation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond (digital simulation). Besides, absence of reductive formation of dimers is a further indication of a preferential intramolecular reactivity determined by the SupLUMO interaction (cis isomer pre&#8208;organization). The redox&#8208;gated covalent bond, serving as electron reservoir, was studied via atropisomerism of the reduction product (VT&#8197;NMR study). The overall picture derived from this in&#8208;depth study of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;di(N&#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl proves that trans and cis species are worth considered as intrinsically sharply different, that is, as doubly&#8208;electrophoric and singly&#8208;superelectrophoric switchable assemblies, beyond conformational isomerism. Most importantly, the through&#8208;space&#8208;mediated SupLUMO may come in complement of other weak interactions encountered in Supramolecular Chemistry as a tool for the design of electroactive architectures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synergistic functioning of redox-active components that emerges from prototypical 2,2&#8242;-di(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyrid-4-ylium)-1,1&#8242;-biphenyl is described. Interestingly, even if a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; conformation of the native assembly is expected, due to electrostatic repulsion between cationic pyridinium units, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; conformation is equally energy-stabilized on account of a peculiar LUMO (SupLUMO) that develops through space, encompassing the two pyridiniums in a single, made-in-one-piece, electronic entity (superelectrophoric behavior). This SupLUMO emergence, with the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; species as superelectrophore embodiment, originates in a sudden change of electronic structure. This finding is substantiated by insights from solid state (single-crystal X-ray diffraction) and solution (NOE NMR and UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry) studies, combined with electronic structure computations. Electrochemistry shows that electron transfers are so strongly correlated that two-electron reduction manifests itself as a single-step process with a large potential inversion consistent with inner creation of a carbon-carbon bond (digital simulation). Besides, absence of reductive formation of dimers is a further indication of a preferential intramolecular reactivity determined by the SupLUMO interaction (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomer pre-organization). The redox-gated covalent bond, serving as electron reservoir, was studied via atropisomerism of the reduction product (VT&#8197;NMR study). The overall picture derived from this in-depth study of 2,2&#8242;-di(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyrid-4-ylium)-1,1&#8242;-biphenyl proves that &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; species are worth considered as intrinsically sharply different, that is, as doubly-electrophoric and singly-superelectrophoric switchable assemblies, beyond conformational isomerism. Most importantly, the through-space-mediated SupLUMO may come in complement of other weak interactions encountered in Supramolecular Chemistry as a tool for the design of electroactive architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemistry on the Complex: Derivatization of TiO4N2&#8208;Based Complexes and Application to Multi&#8208;Step Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17910-17920, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry performed on TiO4N2&#8211;complexes enables the derivatization of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands via metal catalyzed reactions, click chemistry or imine condensation. These complexes are purified by chromatography and their structures are determined. The free substituted 1,10&#8208; phenanthroline compounds are easily obtained through the decoordination from the titanium center. The application of this chemistry on the complex permits to generate an original bis&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline compound.







Abstract
The chemistry on octahedral TiO4N2&#8208;complexes is described. The Ti(IV)&#8208;based precursors are composed of two 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenolato ligands (1) and one substituted 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (2&#8208;5). The application of imine condensation, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation or copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition allowed the grafting of various new groups onto these species. In particular Sonogashira reactions permitted to observe an excellent conversion of the starting complexes. This systematic study enabled to compile the factors required to preserve the framework of the complexes in the course of a chemical transformation. Thanks to this chemistry realized on the complex, the Ti(1)2 fragment was used as a protecting group to develop a multi&#8208;step synthesis of a bis&#8208;phenanthroline compound (12), for which the synthesis without this protection failed. Thus, a dinuclear complex [Ti2(1)4(12)] was first prepared starting from complex precursor bearing an acetylenic function via a Hay coupling reaction. This was followed by a deprotection step affording 12. Overall, this work illustrates how the Ti(1)2 fragment could be an useful tool for the preparation of unprecedented diimine compounds.

         <title>CD Stretching Modes are Sensitive to the Microenvironment in Ionic Liquids</title>

Use of perdeuterated surface&#8208;active ionic liquids allows for the in&#8197;situ IR spectroscopic differentiation between alkyl chains exposed to a polar microenvironment of the ions and those agglomerated via van der Waals interactions into nonpolar regions. In the monolayer film, the segregation phenomenon depends on the electrode potential.







Abstract
Knowledge of the structure of the electrical double layer in ionic liquids (IL) is crucial for their applications in electrochemical technologies. We report the synthesis and applicability of an imidazolium&#8208;based amphiphilic ionic liquid with a perdeuterated alkyl chain for studies of electric potential&#8208;dependent rearrangements, and changes in the microenvironment in a monolayer on a Au(111) surface. Electrochemical measurements show two states of the organization of ions on the electrode surface. In situ IR spectroscopy shows that the alkyl chains in imidazolium cations change their orientation depending on the adsorption state. The methylene&#8208;d2 stretching modes in the perdeuterated IL display a reversible, potential&#8208;dependent appearance of a new band. The presence of this mode also depends on the anion in the IL. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, this new mode is assigned to a second &#957;as(CD2) band in alkyl&#8208;chain fragments embedded in a polar environment of the anions/solvent present in the vicinity of the imidazolium cation and electrode. It is a measure of the potential&#8208;dependent segregation between polar and nonpolar environments in the layers of an IL closest to the electrode.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17794-17801, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tradeoff between global and local aromaticity is demonstrated for a new series of macrocyclic furans. The global antiaromatic character decreases with macrocycle size, whereas the local aromatic character increases. This trend, which is observed both experimentally and computationally, is explained by the distortion of the larger macrocycles out of planarity.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade&#8208;off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, the aromatic character of furan is relatively small, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, weakly emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity. In contrast, the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non&#8208;planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption band for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.

         <title>Partial Hydrolysis of Cyanide Coordination Polymers Induced by a Pillar Ligand with Optimized Electrochemical Kinetics for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17818-17823, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delaying the inevitable: Hydrolysis of MOF and coordination polymer electrode materials in alkaline electrolyte is inevitable. However, we have found that the hydrolysis of cyanide&#8208;bridged nickel&#8208;based coordination polymer electrode materials can be suppressed by the introduction of pillared pyrazine ligands; this optimizes the electrochemical performance. The possible mechanism of partial hydrolysis of electrode materials was proposed, and the hypothesis was justified by ex situ electrochemical and structural characterization.







Abstract
Coordination polymers are promising cathode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries. Therefore, the precise modulation of these cathodes by chemical structure and in&#8208;depth structure transform study is necessary. Here, two model coordination polymer battery cathodes were designed to demonstrate the dynamic structure&#8211;performance relationship. We studied the electrochemical performance of two kinds of nickel&#8208;based coordination polymer, comprising a planar 2D cyanide&#8208;bridged network and a 3D cyanide&#8208;bridged network pillared by pyrazine molecules. The 2D coordination polymer showed serious voltage degradation with poor rate capability, whereas the 3D coordination polymer exhibited stable voltage output coupled with high rate at various current densities. The investigation revealed the underlining relationship of plateau voltage degradation and hydrolysis process of electrodes. It was revealed that the pyrazine pillar molecules in the 3D coordination polymer could suppress the hydrolysis and lead to the in&#8197;situ formation of partially hydrolyzed structure with excellent electrochemical kinetics; this exhibited obvious smaller peak separation (27&#8197;mV compared with 149&#8197;mV) and hence an almost twofold increase in capacity retention (31.9 to 50.0&#8201;%) and energy density retention (18.2 to 35.9&#8201;%) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

The investigation revealed the underlining relationship of plateau voltage degradation and hydrolysis process of electrodes. It was revealed that the pyrazine pillar molecules in the 3D coordination polymer could suppress the hydrolysis and lead to the in&#8197;situ formation of partially hydrolyzed structure with excellent electrochemical kinetics; this exhibited obvious smaller peak separation (27&#8197;mV compared with 149&#8197;mV) and hence an almost twofold increase in capacity retention (31.9 to 50.0&#8201;%) and energy density retention (18.2 to 35.9&#8201;%) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Pyrazine&#8208;Fused Carbene Au(I) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17834-17842, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gold(I)&#8208;carbene complex shows high efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and sub&#8208;microsecond emission lifetime. The use of conventional pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand as the acceptor provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is conceived to inherit the advantages of both phosphorescent metal complexes and purely organic TADF compounds for high&#8208;performance electroluminescence. Herein a panel of new TADF Au(I) emitters has been designed and synthesized by using carbazole and pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the donor and acceptor ligands, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures show linear molecular shape and coplanar arrangement of the donor and acceptor with small dihedral angles of &lt;6.5&#176;. The coplanar orientation and appropriate separation of the HOMO and LUMO in this type of molecules favour the formation of charge&#8208;transfer excited state with appreciable oscillator strength. Together with a minor but essential heavy atom effect of Au ion, the complexes in doped films exhibit highly efficient (&#934;&#8764;0.9) and short&#8208;lived (&lt;1 &#956;s) green emissions via TADF. Computational studies on this class of emitters have been performed to decipher the key reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) pathway. In addition to a small energy splitting between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST), the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect is found to be larger at a specific torsion angle between the donor and acceptor planes which favours the RISC process the most. This work provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters for OLED application.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
The optimized external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the proposed LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest values for perovskite LECs reported so far. This work successfully demonstrates that separating the ion transport, electron injection and transport layer from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance than mixing all the components in a single emissive layer. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/complex LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.







Abstract
Recently, perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high potential in optoelectronic applications. Employing perovskites as the emissive materials of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) shows the advantages of simple fabrication process, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert electrodes, along with saturated electroluminescence (EL) emission. Unlike in previously reported perovskite LECs, in which salts are incorporated in the emissive layer, the ion&#8208;transport layer was separated from the emissive layer in this work. The layer of ionic transition metal complex (iTMC) not only provides mobile ions but also serves as an electron&#8208;injection/transport layer. Orthogonal solvents are used in spin coating to prevent the intermixing of stacked perovskite and iTMC layers. The blue iTMC with high ionization potential is effective in blocking holes from the emissive layer and thus ensures EL color saturation. In addition, the carrier balance of the perovskite/iTMC LECs can be optimized by adjusting the iTMC layer thickness. The optimized external quantum efficiency of the CsPbBr3/iTMC LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported values for perovskite LECs. This work successfully demonstrates that, compared with mixing all components in a single emissive layer, separating the layer of ion transport, electron injection and transport from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/iTMC LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzoisoselenazolones via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Annulative Selenation by Using Elemental Selenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17952-17959, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium is developed. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions to give isoselenazolone derivatives. An unprecedented selenation mechanism involving an electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor is proposed based on the designed control experiments, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and computational study.







Abstract
Isoselenazolone derivatives have attracted significant research interest because of their potent therapeutic activities and indispensable applications in organic synthesis. Efficient construction of functionalized isoselenazolone scaffolds is still challenging, and thus new synthetic approaches with improved operational simplicity have been of particular interest. In this manuscript, we introduce a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions, and the obtained isoselenazolones could be pivotal synthetic precursors for several organoselenium compounds. Based on the designed control experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we propose an unprecedented selenation mechanism involving a highly electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor. The reaction mechanism was further verified by a computational study.

A series of cationic and neutral p&#8208;bromo and p&#8208;nitropyridine substituted Eu(III) and Gd(III) coordination complexes serve as versatile synthetic intermediates. This approach allows the late stage tuning of absorption and emission spectroscopic properties for Eu(III) complexes, and provides easy access to the corresponding Eu(II) analogues, aiding the development of Gd(III) EPR spin probes that can be readily conjugated to biomolecules, under mild conditions.







Abstract
A series of cationic and neutral p&#8722;Br and p&#8722;NO2 pyridine substituted Eu(III) and Gd(III) coordination complexes serve as versatile synthetic intermediates. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution occurs readily at the para position under mild conditions, allowing C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bond forming reactions to take place, permitting the introduction of azide, amino and alkynyl substituents. For Eu(III) complexes, this approach allows late stage tuning of absorption and emission spectral properties, exemplified by the lowering of the energy of an LMCT transition accompanied by a reduction in the Eu&#8722;Npy bond length. Additionally, these complexes provide direct access to the corresponding Eu(II) analogues. With the Gd(III) series, the nature of the p&#8208;substituent does not significantly change the EPR properties (linewidth, relaxation times), as required for their development as EPR spin probes that can be readily conjugated to biomolecules under mild conditions.

         <title>Sequential Hydrogen Tunneling in o&#8208;Tolylmethylene</title>

Who is first? Conformer specificity, although rarely evidenced, is expected to play a crucial role in tunneling reactions. [1,4] hydrogen transfer in o&#8208;tolylmethylene is a puzzling example in this respect, as the apparent rate constants do not differ for the two conformers. Our structural, kinetic, and energetic analyses demonstrate that conformer specificity is disguised by a rotational tunneling pre&#8208;equilibrium.







Abstract
o&#8208;Tolylmethylene 1 is a metastable triplet carbene that rearranges to o&#8208;xylylene 2 even at temperatures as low as 2.7&#8197;K via [1,4] H atom tunneling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopical techniques were used to identify two conformers of 1 (anti and syn) in noble gas matrices and in frozen organic solutions. Conformer&#8208;specific kinetic measurements revealed that the rate constants for the rearrangements of the anti and syn conformers of 1 are very similar. However, the orbital alignment in the syn conformer is less favorable for the hydrogen transfer reaction than the orbital configuration in the anti conformer. Our spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigations indicate that anti 1 and syn 1 rapidly interconvert via efficient quantum tunneling forming a rotational pre&#8208;equilibrium. The subsequent second tunneling reaction, the [1,4] H migration from anti 1 to 2, is rate&#8208;limiting for the formation of 2. We here present an efficient strategy for the study of such tunneling equilibria.

         <title>Insights into Proton Dynamics in a Photofunctional Salt&#8208;Cocrystal Continuum: Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray, Neutron Diffraction, and Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>

Creating crystal chameleons: X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) demonstrate that the slight difference of the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds (HBs) in crystalline metastable acid&#8208;base complexes gives distinct photoluminescent properties. Our results contribute to understanding the complicated relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes, helping to create novel photofunctional materials.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and theoretical calculations were used to investigate the relationship between the optical properties and degree of protonation in acid&#8208;base complexes. We prepared five acid&#8208;base complexes by using a pyridine&#8208;modified pyrrolopyrrole derivative and salicylic acid. Two of the prepared acid&#8208;base complexes were polymorphs of guest&#8208;free crystals with green emission; the other three were guest&#8208;inclusion crystals with yellow emission containing CH2Cl2, CH2Br2, or C2H4Cl2. The presence or absence of guests caused the emission to change color, altering the hydrogen bond strength between the acid&#8208;base complexes. Accurate N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H distances between the pyridyl moiety and the carboxy group over the temperature range 123 to 273&#8197;K were 1.40&#8197;&#197; for the guest&#8208;free crystals and 1.25&#8197;&#197; for the guest&#8208;inclusion crystals. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes.

Get PALs quick: A multicomponent reaction for the one&#8208;step synthesis of PAL probes. A library of diverse bromodomain (BET)&#8208;targeting PAL probes was synthesized and profiled extensively (physicochemical properties, biochemical and cellular activities, photolabeling efficiencies and crystallographic studies). Optimal probes were profiled by MS&#8208;based proteomics to capture BET proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on/off&#8208;target profiles. We envisage that this methodology can be used to quickly access PAL probes for other compounds&#8208;of&#8208;interest and obtain their target profiles.







Abstract
We present a one&#8208;step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live&#8208;cell MS&#8208;based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan&#8208;BET (BET: bromodomain and extra&#8208;terminal domain) selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS&#8208;based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on&#8208; and off&#8208;target profiles.

Sandwich time! In a study giving new ideas on the design of anion receptors, very strong anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions were calculated between halides and aromatic ligands in transition&#8208;metal half&#8208;sandwich compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands. The strongest interactions surpass the energy of &#8722;20&#8197;kcal/mol, which is stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions between halides and organic aromatic molecules.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich compounds of benzene, cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, and indenyl were studied as a new type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for interactions with halide anions. Although uncoordinated benzene forms only C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions, and hexafluorobenzene forms only anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds can form both types of interactions, because their entire electrostatic potential surface is positive. These aromatic ligands can form stronger anion&#8208;&#960; interactions than organic aromatic molecules, as a consequence of more pronounced dispersion and induction energy components. Moreover, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions of aromatic ligands are stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, and significantly stronger than C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions of benzene. Our study shows that transition&#8208;metal coordination can make aromatic moieties suitable for strong interactions with anions, and gives insight into the design of new anion receptors.

Ribbon&#8208;like and block&#8208;like crystals of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(p&#8208;tolyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one (2ClChMe&#8208;4) exhibit curling/flipping and expansion, respectively, upon heating on account of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations in polymorphs. Besides, 2ClChMe&#8208;4 can undergo a solid&#8208;state [2+2] cycloaddition reaction, which becomes the driving force for the photo&#8208;induced bending of the ribbon&#8208;like crystal, so that the molecular&#8208;crystal&#8208;based photoactuator could perform mechanical work for carrying small object. Herein, a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive actuator showing reversible bending&#8208;unbending behavior triggered by light and heat successively has been fabricated.







Abstract
The polymorphs of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 in Form I (ribbon&#8208;like crystal) and Form II (block&#8208;like crystal) were prepared, and they exhibited curling/flipping and expansion upon heating on account of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations. The irreversible phase transformations occurred separately at 53.2&#8201;&#176;C and 57.8&#8201;&#176;C for the crystals in Form I and Form II, during which the molecular conformation of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 changed and the molecules slipped along the (100) plane. Movement at the molecular level resulted in changes of cell parameters, which in turn led to macroscopic motions of the crystals upon heating. Additionally, the ribbon&#8208;like crystals of 2ClChMe&#8208;4 showed photo&#8208;induced bending driven by [2+2] cycloaddition. Accordingly, an actuator showing reversible bending behavior was fabricated triggered by light and heat successively. Like biomimetic self&#8208;actuators, such multi&#8208;stimuli mechanical responsive molecular crystals might have potential applications in soft robots, artificial muscles and microfluidic systems.

&lt;p&gt;The polymorphs of &lt;b&gt;2ClChMe-4&lt;/b&gt; in Form I (ribbon-like crystal) and Form II (block-like crystal) were prepared, and they exhibited curling/flipping and expansion upon heating on account of single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations.

Additionally, the ribbon-like crystals of &lt;b&gt;2ClChMe-4&lt;/b&gt; showed photo-induced bending driven by [2+2] cycloaddition. Accordingly, an actuator showing reversible bending behavior was fabricated triggered by light and heat successively.

         <dc:description>
Recently published contributions of unusual unsaturated ring strained Group 4 metallocene metallacycles show new aspects of these compounds. Several new investigations of 7&#8208; and 5&#8208;membered metalla&#8208;cyclocumulenes, 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered metalla&#8208;cycloallenes as well as metalla&#8208;cyclopentynes, complete the understanding of these compounds. From the theoretical point of view and the reactivity they have a great potential for important synthetic applications. For more information, see the Minireview by Rosenthal on page&#8197;17751.

Think globally, act locally: The trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of aromaticity is demonstrated for a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic furans of various sizes. Whereas smaller macrocycles are planar, larger macrocycles distort out of planarity, thereby avoiding global antiaromaticity, and display increasing character of local aromaticity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by O. Gidron et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103536).

A layer of ionic transition metal complex promotes electron injection and transport, resulting in an improved carrier balance of green CsPbBr3 perovskite/iTMC light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). The optimized external quantum efficiency reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for perovskite LECs so far.

Hydrogen bonding is a fundamental interaction in daily life and plays an important role in chemical, physical, and biochemical processes. This work presents a metastable acid&#8211;base crystalline material whose luminescence color varies between green and yellow depending on the strength of the hydrogen bonds. The two single crystal structures shown were revealed in detail by neutron structural analysis and modern computational chemistry. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Ono, Y. Hisaeda, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103044).

This work presents a metastable acid&#8211;base crystalline material whose luminescence color varies between green and yellow depending on the strength of the hydrogen bonds. The two single crystal structures shown were revealed in detail by neutron structural analysis and modern computational chemistry. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Ono, Y. Hisaeda, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202103044"&gt;10.1002/chem.202103044&lt;/a&gt;).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast spectroscopic techniques in the electronic and vibrational domains have enabled the real&#8208;time tracking of molecular motions from electrons to atoms in naturally sourced organic chromophores, powering their intrinsic photoresponse and excited&#8208;state mechanisms that could be rationally tuned and designed for versatile optoelectronic applications. An interplay between charge/proton/energy transfer across singlet and triplet states has been highlighted as these organic optoelectronic materials represent a sustainable and efficient route to meet the growing energy and technological demands.

Abstract
Recently published syntheses, reactions and characterizations of unusual unsaturated ring strained Group 4 metallocene metallacycles like metalla&#8208;cyclocumulenes, &#8208;cycloallenes and &#8208;cycloalkynes with different ring size are updated for the last three years. There exist for some of these metallacycles, depending on the ring size, 7&#8208;, 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered compounds. The new results for these metallacycles are summarized here and considered in addition to the former published results. Additionally, several compounds of this type were now characterized by new reactions. For a better understanding of these compounds, some spectroscopical methods as well as theoretical calculations were published. Despite of these all&#8208;C&#8208;metallacycles, only in some cases the syntheses and reactions for the corresponding hetero&#8208;metallacycles were published too. Examples for these metallaheterocyclic compounds will not be considered in this article. All these unusual ring strained compounds have a great potential for a lot of interesting synthetic applications in the future. Additionally, they are very interesting from the theoretical point of view.

Organic optoelectronics: Naturally sourced organic chromophores with photosensitivity have enabled a variety of sustainable optoelectronics for light harvesting, transistors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes with broad societal benefits. To facilitate the rational design, ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy provides a powerful toolset to gain fundamental insights into the working mechanisms of these organic &#8220;molecular machines&#8221; from solution to thin films, aiming to improve the relevant device performance.







Abstract
Recent advances in sustainable optoelectronics including photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, transistors, and semiconductors have been enabled by &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules. A fundamental understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions involving these materials can be realized by time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies. In this Minireview, the photoinduced mechanisms including charge/energy transfer, electronic (de)localization, and excited&#8208;state proton transfer are correlated with functional properties encompassing optical absorption, fluorescence quantum yield, conductivity, and photostability. Four naturally derived molecules (xylindein, dimethylxylindein, alizarin, indigo) with ultrafast spectral insights showcase efficient energy dissipation involving H&#8208;bonding networks and proton motions, which yield high photostability. Rational design principles derived from such investigations could increase the efficiency for light harvesting, triplet formation, and photosensitivity for improved and versatile optoelectronic performance.

         <title>THF&#8208;solvated Heavy Alkali Metal Benzyl Compounds (Na, Rb, Cs): Defined Deprotonation Reagents for Alkali Metal Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 71, Page 17780-17784, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective formation of THF&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds provides a decisive toolbox for alkali metal mediation chemistry and the introduction of the heavier congeners of lithium into small molecules. Crystal structures, NMR studies as well as quantum chemical calculations give detailed insights into these compounds. Experimental investigations towards deprotonations with application in aminometalation reactions are presented.







Abstract
The incorporation of heavy alkali metals into substrates is both challenging and essential for many reactions. Here, we report the formation of THF&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds [PhCH2M&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(thf)n] (M=Na, Rb, Cs). The synthesis was carried out by deprotonation of toluene with the bimetallic mixture n&#8208;butyllithium/alkali metal tert&#8208;butoxide and selective crystallization from THF of the defined benzyl compounds. Insights into the molecular structure in the solid as well as in solution state are gained by single crystal X&#8208;ray experiments and NMR spectroscopic studies. The compounds could be successfully used as alkali metal mediating reagents. The example of caesium showed the convenient use by deprotonating acidic C&#8722;H as well as N&#8722;H compounds to gain insight into the aminometalation using these reagents.

         <title>A New Nonlinear Optical Material with N(CN)2&#8722; Anion</title>

A novel second&#8208;order nonlinear optical material Y[N(CN)2]4[NH(C2H5)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O with anionic group N(CN)2&#8722; is not only strongly NLO&#8208;active at 1064&#8197;nm with a response of about 2.8&#215;KH2PO4, but also is UV transparent down to 250&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Discovering new functional genes and developing high&#8208;performance materials are the goals being pursued by scientists. In this work, we successfully obtained a second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) material via the aqueous solution method, Y[N(CN)2]4[NH(C2H5)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O, which is the first NLO material with the anionic group N(CN)2&#8722;. Remarkably, this material is not only strongly NLO&#8208;active at 1064&#8197;nm with a response of about 2.8 &#215; KH2PO4, but also possesses a short UV absorption edge of 250&#8197;nm. In&#8208;depth first&#8208;principles calculations illustrate well that the optical properties are mainly from the strong interaction of N, C and Y atoms. This result indicates that the N(CN)2&#8722; anion may be a new NLO functional gene. This work enriches the diversity of NLO functional genes and materials.

         <title>A Radical Addition/Cyclization and Se&#8208;Group Transfer Strategy for the Facile Synthesis of Se&#8208;Containing Cyclopentenes under Metal&#8208;Free and Peroxide&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

A highly atom&#8208;economic intermolecular radical addition/cyclization and Se&#8208;group transfer strategy was developed for the efficient synthesis of Se&#8208;containing cyclopentenes under metal&#8208;free and peroxide&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A novel intermolecular radical addition/cyclization and Se&#8208;group transfer reaction of terminal alkynes and unsaturated alkyl selenide is presented which offers a straightforward and facile approach for the synthesis of valuable Se&#8208;containing cyclopentenes. Remarkable features of this strategy include easily accessible starting materials, metal&#8208;free and peroxide&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, simple operation and broad substrate scope. More importantly, the reaction is easy to scale up and can be extended to the construction of six&#8208;membered carbon ring.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis</title>

Inner catalysis: Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis is implanted into polyoxometalates (POMs) through the insertion of urea into the framework. A likely combination of electron&#8208;withdrawing effects and double activation through the metal&#8208;oxo surface enables urea catalysis in POMs. The organopolyoxometalate catalysts can be recycled and reused several times. Modelling of the urea conformation when grafted to the vanadium crown, and NMR are used to investigate this new POM property.







Abstract
Several urea&#8208;inserted organo&#8208;polyoxometalates (POMs) derived from polyoxotungstovanadate [P2V3W15O61]9&#8722; were prepared. The insertion of the carbonyl into the polyoxometallic framework activates the urea toward Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis. This was shown on the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Modelling shows that the most stable form of the organo&#8208;POMs features a cis&#8208;trans arrangement of the two N&#8722;H bonds, but that the likely catalytically active trans&#8208;trans form is accessible at room temperature. Finally, it is possible that the oxo substituents next to the vanadium atoms may help the approach of the nucleophile via H&#8208;bonding.

         <title>Difluorocarbene&#8208;Induced Ring&#8208;Opening Difluoromethylation&#8208;Halogenation of Cyclic (Thio)Ethers with TMSCF2X (X=Br, Cl)**

In&#8208;situ protonation of difluromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylides (generated from diflurorocarbene and cyclic (thio)ethers) constitutes the formal activation of C&#8722;O/S bond of (thio)ethers with difluormethyl cation, thus facilitating the ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic (thio)ethers. (TMS=trimethylsilyl).







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic (thio)ethers is reported through a simple strategy relying on carbon&#8208;chalcogen bond activation with difluorocarbene. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ protonation of the previously little&#8208;known difluoromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylide intermediate followed by ring&#8208;opening with halide ion to afford halogenated acyclic difluoromethyl (thio)ethers that can then be employed for further elaboration. TMSCF2X (X=Br, Cl) are unique reagents to achieve this synthetic purpose, which serve as both the difluorocarbene source and the halide ion source.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Mesoporous Carbons from Cyclodextrin Nanosponges Enabling High&#8208;Capacity Silicon Anodes and Sulfur Cathodes for Lithiated Si&#8208;S Batteries</title>

A facile production strategy to synthesize Si and S directly within porous carbon derived from cyclodextrin nanosponges. These materials act as high capacity electrodes in Lithiated Si&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. Their typical structure of truncated cone can host a wide variety of guest molecules to create inclusion complexes; indeed, we daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high&#8208;capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and guarantees stable cycling performance. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. We show that the use of commercial LP30 electrolyte causes a larger capacity fade, and this is associated with different solid electrolyte interface layer formation and it is also demonstrated that fluoroethylene carbonate addition can significantly increase the capacity retention and the overall performance of our nanostructured Si/C composite in both ether&#8208;based and LP30 electrolytes. As a result, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8722;S cell.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Fe/N/C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Containing Fe&#8722;N4 Sites from an Iron Complex Precursor with 5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;Diazatriphenylene Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts are prepared from iron complex precursors containing 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene ligands with two bromo substituents by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. The iron complex precursors were efficiently converted to atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 active sites without generating less active iron aggregates during pyrolysis. The Fe&#8722;N4 active sites were identified by STEM&#8208;EELS observations and in&#8197;situ electrochemical Fe K edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic measurements. The Fe/N/C catalysts show high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts containing Fe&#8722;Nx sites prepared by pyrolysis are promising cathode materials for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. We have developed iron complexes containing N2&#8208; or N3&#8208;chelating coordination structures with preorganized aromatic rings in a 1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene framework tethering bromo substituents as precursors to precisely construct Fe&#8722;N4 sites in an Fe/N/C catalyst. One&#8208;step pyrolysis of the iron complex with carbon black forms atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 sites without iron aggregates. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical measurements revealed that the iron complex with N3&#8208;coordination is more effectively converted to Fe&#8722;N4 sites catalyzing ORR with a TOF value of 0.21&#8197;e&#8201;site&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE. This indicates that the formation of Fe&#8722;N4 sites is controlled by precise tuning of the chemical structure of the iron complex precursor.

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competition for the lone pair: Our paper describes efforts to access cationic &#945;&#8208;silylated (and &#945;&#8208;germylated) phosphorus ylides of the general formula [R3PC(R)SiR2]+. One inherent feature of these molecules is that the silyl and phosphonyl entities compete for the lone pair of electrons. The ambivalent nature of the possible resonance structures is reflected in the coloured segmentation of the cover feature. The two &#8220;competitors&#8221; are illustrated as sportspersons, and both resonance structures are represented depending on where the ball of positive change is. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Breher et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103974).

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;Dependent AIE Fluorophore Based on HBT Derivative: Substituent Positional Impact on Aggregated Luminescence and its Application for Hydrogen Peroxide Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two positional isomers are presented, p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT, and their structural feature is mainly different in one BT substituent position on HBT fluorophore. Surprisingly, they exhibited totally opposite luminescence behaviour in water/THF cosolvents with different water volume fractions (fw). More importantly, the unique AIE&#8208;ESIPT properties allowed p&#8208;BHBT to construct the chemosensor, Probe&#8208;1, for highly selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.







Abstract
Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to p&#8208;BHBT and ortho position refers to o&#8208;BHBT). Fluorescence emission properties of p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which p&#8208;BHBT showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while o&#8208;BHBT displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, Probe&#8208;1, generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore p&#8208;BHBT, was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22&#8197;&#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.

         <title>Light&#8208;assisted Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides: The synergetic effect between plasmonic copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes from various sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, we loaded plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving the high yield of diaryl ethers. We believe that this study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically&#8208;sustainable process.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin states, bonding and magnetism in mixed valence iron(0)&#8211;iron(II) complexes</title>

         <dc:description>"Xenophilic" complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe&#160;two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8211;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8211;Fp (LX&#160;=&#160;b&#8208;aldiminate or&#160;b&#8208;diketim&#173;inate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into the Fe&#8211;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electro&#173;static interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8211;&#160;"metalloligand" as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange&#8208;red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In case of orange&#8208;red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters. And the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange&#8208;red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra, therefore more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters based on molecular structures such as cyano benzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron based acceptors. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: A Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designer tri&#8208;block copolymer is described to broaden epigenetic combination therapy. Upon intracellular reduction and esterase hydrolysis, it releases nothing but HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug, CO2, and PEG. The design is rooted from a thiol&#8208;based HDACi, for which optimization balances requirements of both efficacy and control&#8208;release, highlighting a new paradigm in polyprodrug nanomedicine: taking pharmaceutics guidelines into account at the medicinal chemistry stage.







Abstract
We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end&#8208;to&#8208;end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach, carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work highlights, for the first time, the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.

The design is rooted from a thiol-based HDACi, for which optimization balances requirements of both efficacy and control-release, highlighting a new paradigm in polyprodrug nanomedicine: taking pharmaceutics guidelines into account at the medicinal chemistry stage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri-block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built-in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end-to-end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach, carefully designed to benefit both control-release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work highlights, for the first time, the unique advantage of thiol-based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mild Microfluidic Approaches to Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the preparation of oxide nanoparticles in microreactors under continuous flow conditions. The use of suitable methodologies allows to manage the size and shape of the nanoparticles, through the fast mixing of the reagents and the precise control of the reaction conditions that can be achieved within flow devices, if compared to batch syntheses.







Abstract
Oxide nanoparticles (oxide NPs) are advanced materials with a wide variety of applications in different fields. The use of continuous flow methods is particularly appealing for their synthesis due to the high control achieved over the reaction conditions and the easy process scalability. The present review focuses on the preparation of oxide NPs using microfluidic setups at low temperature (&#8804;80&#8201;&#176;C), since the employment of mild reaction conditions is crucial for developing sustainable and cost&#8208;effective processes. A particular emphasis will be put on the improvement over the final product features (e.&#8201;g., size, shape, and size distribution) given by flow methods with respect to conventional batch procedures. The main issues that arise by treating NPs suspensions in microfluidic systems are product deposition or channel clogging; mitigation strategies to overcome these drawbacks will also be presented and discussed.

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular uptake of high&#8208;density brush polymers with peptide side chains is governed by the net charge of the polymers. Stimuli responsive cleavable linkers are employed to control the charge of the polymers and to trigger cellular uptake of brush polymers possessing a net positive charge.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids through stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.

         <title>Understanding the Preparation and Reactivity of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The life of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5. Non&#8208;oxidative methane dehydroaromatization is a high&#8208;temperature reaction taking place over zeolite&#8208;based Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst. We used operando spectroscopy to monitor the structural evolution of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 during its whole lifetime: from catalyst synthesis and activation to reaction, deactivation, and regeneration. We derived spectroscopic descriptors for molybdenum precursor decomposition, reduction of dispersed Mo&#8208;oxo centers to form active sites and, finally, evolution of active sites during reductive and oxidative regeneration.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts during their whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of similar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincides with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalysts.

         <title>Assessing the Importance of Cation Size in the Tetragonal&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition in Lithium&#8208;Garnet Electrolytes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high temperature tetragonal&#8208;cubic phase in lithium garnet electrolytes (A3B2Li7O12) is not fully understood. Herein, the transition temperature dependence based on site substitution is investigated, surprisingly it was found a direct relationship to cell volume is perhaps too simplistic. We show that the B site plays an important role, whereas A site substitution (which alters the cell volume noticeably) has minimal difference. The octahedral site ionic radius required to stabilise a room temperature A3B2Li7O12 cubic phase is then suggested.







Abstract
Lithium garnets are promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of seven lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g., La3Zr2Li7O12), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8211;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub&#8208;lattice.
The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.
Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed by variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.

Herein, the transition temperature dependence based on site substitution is investigated, surprisingly it was found a direct relationship to cell volume is perhaps too simplistic. We show that the B site plays an important role, whereas A site substitution (which alters the cell volume noticeably) has minimal difference. The octahedral site ionic radius required to stabilise a room temperature A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; cubic phase is then suggested.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium garnets are promising solid-state electrolytes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of seven lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g., La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8211;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub-lattice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed by variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The rapid development of industrialization and population brings water and air pollution and energy crisis. Solar driven catalysis is expected to relieve above issues. However, low efficiency of solar conversion limited by poor light harvesting and serious charge recombination of semiconductors and high surface reaction barriers is far from the satisfactory of industrial request. Ferroelectrics have been considered as promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO  3  , PbTiO  3  and LiNbO  3  , layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like BiFeO  3  , Bi  2  WO  6  , Bi  2  MoO  6  , etc. and other ferroelectrics have been introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method have been highlighted. Then, the research progress of ferroelectrics for photocatalysis has been summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO  2  reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts have been provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present a deep insight and guideline for the future research works of ferroelectrics  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Ferroelectric Metallomesogen Exhibiting Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional Co(II) compound exhibiting liquid crystal, ferroelectricity, and field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior has been synthesized for the first time. The results provide new insights towards the development of a new category of magnetoelectric (ME) materials.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) materials exhibiting coupled electric and magnetic properties are of significant interest because of their potential use in memory storage devices, new sensors, or low&#8208;consumption devices. Herein, we report a new category of ME material that shows liquid crystal (LC), ferroelectric (FE), and field&#8208;induced single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviors. Co(II) complex incorporating alkyl chains of type [Co(3C16&#8208;bzimpy)2](BF4)2 (1; 3C16&#8208;bzimpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;hexadecyloxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;hexadecyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)) displayed a chiral smectic C mesophase in the temperature range 321&#8197;K&#8211;458&#8197;K, in which distinct FE behavior was observed, with a remnant polarization (88.3&#8197;nC&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Complex 1 also exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior that reflects the large magnetic anisotropy of the Co(II) center. Furthermore, the dielectric property of 1 was able to be tuned by an external magnetic field occurring from both spin&#8208;lattice coupling and molecular orientational variation. Clearly, this multifunctional compound, combining LC, FE, and SMM properties, represents an entry to the development of a range of next&#8208;generation ME materials.

         <title>Spiroconjugated Tetraaminospirenes as Donors in Color&#8208;Tunable Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emitters go spiro: Using spiroconjugated tetraamines as a novel type of donor and a range of different acceptors in three different modes of connection, 12 donor&#8208;acceptor compounds are synthesized. Their twisted structures lead to a spatial separation of the HOMOs and LUMOs. Photophysical measurements show tunable emission colors for these donor&#8208;acceptor compounds, and photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 99&#8201;% in solution are obtained.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer emitters are attractive due to their color tunability and potentially high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). We herein present tetraaminospirenes as donor moieties, which, in combination with a variety of acceptors, furnished 12 charge&#8208;transfer emitters with a range of emission colors and PLQYs of up to 99&#8201;%. The spatial separation of their frontier molecular orbitals was obtained through careful structural design, and two DA structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A range of photophysical measurements supported by DFT calculations shed light on the optoelectronic properties of this new family of spiro&#8208;NN&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor dyes.

         <title>Molecular Modelling and Simulations of Light&#8208;Harvesting Decanuclear Ru&#8208;Based Dendrimers for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molucular simulations on the structure of a decanuclear Ru&#8208;based dendrimer capable to play the role of antenna for artificial photosynthesis is performed. Aggregation of dendrimers is also modelled and compared to experimental results obtained by SAXS, scanning tunneling electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
The structure of a decanuclear photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active dendrimer based on Ru(II) polypyridine subunits, suitable as a light&#8208;harvesting multicomponent species for artificial photosynthesis, has been investigated by means of computer modelling. The compound has the general formula [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru[(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru(bpy)2]2}3](PF6)20 (Ru10; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; dpp=2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazine). The stability of possible isomers of each monomer was investigated by performing classical molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM) simulations on each monomer and comparing the results. The number of stable isomers is reduced to 36 with a prevalence of MER isomerism in the central core, as previously observed by NMR experiments. The simulations on decanuclear dendrimers suggest that the stability of the dendrimer is not linked to the stability of the individual monomers composing the dendrimer but rather governed by the steric constrains originated by the multimetallic assembly. Finally, the self&#8208;aggregation of Ru10 and the distribution of the counterions around the complexes is investigated using Molecular Dynamics both in implicit and explicit acetonitrile solution. In representative examples, with nine and four dendrimers, the calculated pair distribution function for the ruthenium centers suggests a self&#8208;aggregation mechanism in which the dendrimers are approaching in small blocks and then aggregate all together. Scanning transmission electron microscopy complements the investigation, supporting the formation of different aggregates at various concentrations.

         <title>Chiral Ligands in Hypervalent Iodine Compounds: Synthesis and Structures of Binaphthyl&#8208;Based &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contained chirality: Novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents are presented with the chirality contained only in the ligand. These have been characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, and all derivatives show the prominent reactivities of hypervalent iodine reagents. Due to their limited stability in solution, they are inefficient chiral iodine(III) derivatives.







Abstract
Several novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents have been prepared and structurally analysed. Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed; however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. NMR experiments indicated that these reagents are very easily hydrolysed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to the limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.

         <title>Direct Near Infrared Light&#8211;Activatable Phthalocyanine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going in for infra red: The development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules is described. The choice of solvent is important to promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction involves a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.







Abstract
The high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light makes it effective for use in selective reactions under light&#8208;shielded conditions, such as in sealed reactors and deep tissues. Herein, we report the development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules. The desired photocatalytic properties were achieved in the phthalocyanines by introducing the appropriate peripheral substituents and central metal. These phthalocyanine photocatalysts promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling (CDC) under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. The choice of solvent is important, and a mixture of a reaction&#8208;accelerating (pyridine) and &#8208;decelerating (methanol) solvents was particularly effective. Moreover, we demonstrate photoreactions under visible&#8208;light&#8208;shielded conditions through the transmission of NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction does not involve a photoredox&#8208;type mechanism with electron transfer, but instead a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compounds [1]+.[R]&#8722; and [1]2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[R]&#8722; have been prepared from the respective one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron transfer reactions of 1,4&#8208;disilabenzene (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (1) by using the transferable organometallic oxidants and characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;transferable oxidants such as B(C6F5)3/nBuLi, B(C6F5)3/LiB(C6F5)4, B(C6F5)3/LiHBEt3, Al(C6F5)3/(o&#8208;RC6H4)AlH2 (R=N(CMe2CH2)2CH2), B(C6F5)3/AlEt3, Al(C6F5)3, Al(C6F5)3/nBuLi, Al(C6F5)3/AlMe3, (CuC6F5)4, and Ag2SO4, respectively were employed for reactions with (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (L=PhC(NtBu)2, 1). The stable radical cation [1]+. was formed and paired with the anions [nBuB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 2), [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (in 3), [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 4), [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 5), {[(C6F5)3Al]2(&#956;&#8208;F)]&#8722; (in 6), [nBuAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 7), and [Cu(C6F5)2]&#8722; (in 8), respectively. The stable dication [1]2+ was also generated with the anions [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (9) and [MeAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (10), respectively. In addition, the neutral compound [(L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2][&#956;&#8208;O2S(O)2] (11) was obtained. Compounds 2&#8211;11 are characterized by UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and elemental analysis. Compounds 2&#8211;8 are analyzed by EPR spectroscopy and compounds 9&#8211;11 by NMR spectroscopy. The structure features are discussed on the central Si2C4&#8208;rings of 1, [1]+., [1]2+, and 11, respectively.

         <dc:description>The reaction of  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/  M  F  5  (  M  &#160;=&#160;Sb,&#160;As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8209;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]. In presence of water traces, the diprotonated species of  &#946;  &#8208;alanine [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, in case of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  , single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted. By using SO  2  instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NHSO][SbF  6  ]  2  was obtained, and a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from  N  &#8209;protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, and the MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, respectively, were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reaction of  &#946;  -propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/  M  F  5  (  M  &#160;=&#160;Sb,&#160;As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8209;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ].

         <title>How 5&#8201;f Electron Polarisability Drives Covalency and Selectivity in Actinide N&#8208;Donor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N versus O donor: Isostructural complexes [An(pyren)2] (An=Th, U&#8211;Pu) with a pyrrole&#8208;based ligand (pyren) were synthesised and compared to the structural relative salen. Solid&#8208;state analysis and quantum chemical calculations reveal an increased bond strength to the imine nitrogen when changing the second donor from the dominant O to the softer N. In the complexes, the overall bond strength of salen exceeds pyren, except for the Pa case. This can be explained by a greater degree of polarizability for the Pa 5&#8201;f1 state. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. M&#228;rz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102849).

         <title>Direct Superacid&#8208;Promoted Difluoroethylation of Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an original superelectrophile&#8208;promoted difluoroethylation in superacid, CF2&#8208;Me aromatic amines can be synthesized directly and regioselectivity. Applied to simple substrates, natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients, this method offers an alternative for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of aryl methyl ethers bioisosters.







Abstract
Under superacid conditions, aromatic amines are directly and regioselectively 1,1&#8208;difluoroethylated. Low temperature in situ NMR studies confirmed the presence of benzylic &#945;&#8208;fluoronium and &#945;&#8208;chloronium ions as key intermediates in the reaction. This method has a wide substrate scope and can be applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Uranium(IV) Thio&#8208; and Selenoether Complexes: Syntheses, Structures, and Computational Investigation of U&#8722;ER2 Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranium&#8212;selenoether linkages have been accessed for the first time, enabling the study of U&#8722;SeR2 versus U&#8722;SR2 and U&#8722;OR2 bonding. The shape of the uranium selenoether complex resembles a butterfly, and the cover art depicts a metamorphosis from the protio&#8208;ligand (caterpillar), to the potassium salt of the ligand (chrysalis), to the uranium complex (butterfly). More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;J.&#8197;H. Emslie et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103580). Cover design: N.A.G.G.

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes Bearing Axially Chiral Bipyridyls: The Mismatched Diastereomer Showed Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RutheniumII complexes bearing axially chiral bipyridyls were synthesized, and matched (more relaxed) &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and mismatched (more constrained) &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer was nonluminescent. In contrast, the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited vivid red circularly polarized phosphorescence. For the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the cumulative CH/&#960; interactions seem to suppress further distortion in the T1 state.







Abstract
RutheniumII complexes bearing three axially chiral bipyridyl ligands were synthesized as a new family of chiral complex dyes, and &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggested that all the bipyridyls maintained chirality in both the ground and excited states, and the &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomers are the matched (more relaxed) and mismatched (more constrained) pairs, respectively. The mismatched &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited red circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) both in solution and in the solid state. The solution state CPP is the most intense of ruthenium complexes, while the solid state CPP is the first example of them. It is supposed that, for the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the six cumulative CH/&#960; interactions suppress further distortion in the T1 state.

         <title>Two Faces of the Same Coin: Coupling X&#8208;Ray Absorption and NMR Spectroscopies to Investigate the Exchange Reaction Between Prototypical Cu Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed investigation of the reduction of the octahedral Cu(terpyridine)22+ complex to the tetrahedral Cu(neocuproine)2+ complex using the chemical fuel 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as reductant, has been carried out by exploiting an innovative mechanistic tool based on the complementarity of X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies coupled with Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analys.







Abstract
The satisfactory rationalization of complex reactive pathways in solution chemistry may greatly benefit from the combined use of advanced experimental and theoretical complementary methods of analysis. In this work, we combine X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analyses to gain a comprehensive view on a prototypical reaction involving the variation of the oxidation state and local structure environment of a selected metal ion coordinated by organic ligands. Specifically, we investigate the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid reduction of the octahedral complex established by the Cu2+ ion with terpyridine to the tetrahedral complex formed by Cu+ and neocuproine. Through our interdisciplinary approach we gain insights into the nature, concentration time evolution and structures of the key metal (XAS measurements) and organic (1H NMR measurements) species under reaction. We believe our method may prove to be useful in the toolbox necessary to understand the mechanisms of reactive processes of interest in solution.

         <title>New Palladium &#8211; ZrO2 Nano&#8208;Architectures from Thermal Transformation of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for Carbonylative Suzuki and Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 nanocomposites, obtained by direct pyrolysis of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under nitrogen or air, presented high ability to form benzophenone according to carbonylative Suzuki pathway under 1&#8197;atm of CO with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1. Pd/ZrO2 nanocomposites are superior catalysts of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Its morphology was preserved during the catalytic reaction.







Abstract
The new nanocomposites, Pd/C/ZrO2, PdO/ZrO2, and Pd/PdO/ZrO2, were prepared by thermal conversion of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2 (MOF) in nitrogen or air atmosphere. The presence of Pd nanoparticles, uniformly distributed on the ZrO2 or C/ZrO2 matrix, was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman and X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) methods. All pyrolysed composites retained the shape of the MOF template. They catalyze carbonylative Suzuki coupling under 1&#8197;atm CO with an efficiency significantly higher than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2. The most active PdO/ZrO2 composite, formed benzophenone with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1, while by using Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2, much lower TOF values, 51&#8211;95&#8197;h&#8722;1, were achieved. After the reaction, PdO/ZrO2 was recovered with the same composition and catalytic activity. Very good results were also obtained in the transfer hydrogenation of benzophenones to alcohols with Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation.

         <dc:description>We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives, containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of a two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited state dynamic behavior occurring between the three radially arranged anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with a ca. 3.0 &#197; distances between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradation of herbicides by a plant nonheme iron dioxygenase: mechanism and selectivity of substrate analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogs by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C  2  &#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the  R  &#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trihalide salts were found to efficiently promote photochemical dediazotizing halogenations of diazonium salts. In contrast to classical Sandmeyer reactions, no metal catalysts are required to achieve high yields and outstanding selectivities for halogenation over competing hydridodediazotization.

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 10  7  M  &#8208;1  and large exothermicities &#916;  H  &#176; of &#8208;14 kcal/mol in a 120 mM K  +  buffer at 40 &#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted  N  5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8208;H activation for cysteine bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8208;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Bonding Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8208;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy) 3  2+  ) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03 &#956;M to 300 &#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013 &#181;M (3&#963;/ m  ). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.</dc:description>

Abstract
Multichromophoric systems based on a RuII polypyridine moiety containing an additional organic chromophore are of increasing interest with respect to different light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel RuII photosensitizer, namely [(tbbpy)2Ru((2&#8208;(perylen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthrolline))](PF6)2 RuipPer, that includes a merged perylene dye in the back of the ip ligand. This complex features two emissive excited states as well as a long&#8208;lived (8&#8197;&#956;s) dark state in acetonitrile solution. Compared to prototype [(bpy)3Ru]2+&#8208;like complexes, a strongly altered absorption (&#1013;=50.3&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 467&#8197;nm) and emission behavior caused by the introduction of the perylene unit is found. A combination of spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy was used to elucidate the nature of the excited states. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully used for the efficient formation of reactive singlet oxygen.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic Stereotriads Featuring Fluorinated Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence of two unprecedented steps is described to build acyclic stereotriads bearing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter. The sequence combines a highly diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction from readily available starting materials with an acylative double organocatalyzed kinetic resolution (DoCKR) providing enantioenriched products. This method is practically simple, general, and flexible affording different diastereomers depending on the initial substrates. A mechanistic study supports the observed stereochemistry of fluorinated products.







Abstract
Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction directly generates a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5).

         <title>Solvothermal Synthesis of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with Magnetically Frustrated [Cr7S8]5+ Double&#8208;Cubes**

Novel compound, [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O was synthesized by using DMSO as a source of sulfur in solvothermal synthesis. Crystal structure is composed of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]3+ units connected into 2D layers by bridging ethylenediamine ligands. Magnetic interactions between Cr3+ centers in [Cr7S8]5+ core units were studied using magnetometry and DFT calculations. Strong antiferromagnetic coupling was observed in the peripheral Cr3 triangles as well as between central and peripheral Cr atoms of the Cr7 cluster leading to high degree of frustration.







Abstract
A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with [Cr7S8]5+ dicubane cationic clusters, has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (en) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi&#8208; and monodentate coordination modes; in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8&#8197;K, a highly negative Weiss constant, &#952;=&#8722;224(2)&#8197;K, obtained from Curie&#8208;Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility, suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between S=3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2S+1)7=16384 microstates from seven Cr3+ centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be J1=&#8722;21.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;30.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr3+ center and the peripheral Cr3+ ions of the dicubane cluster. The best simulation of the experimental data was obtained with J1=&#8722;20.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;21.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, in agreement with the slightly stronger AFM exchange within the triangles of the peripheral Cr3+ ions as compared to the AFM exchange between the central and peripheral Cr3+ ions. This compound is proposed as a synthon towards magnetically frustrated systems assembled by linking dicubane transition metal&#8208;chalcogenide clusters into polymeric networks.

Abstract
Bis&#8208;arene sandwich complexes are generally prepared by the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, which conditions are incompatible with most O&#8208; and N&#8208; functional groups. We report a new way for the synthesis of sandwich type complexes [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+ from [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+, with functionalized arenes and pharmaceuticals. N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (NMP) facilitates the substitution of naphthalene with the incoming arene. A series of fully characterized rhenium sandwich complexes with simple arenes, such as aniline, as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin are presented. With these rhenium compounds in hand, the radioactive sandwich complexes [99mTc(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+ (pharm=pharmaceutical) can be unambiguously confirmed. The direct labelling of pharmaceuticals with 99mTc through &#951;6&#8208;coordination to phenyl rings and the confirmation of the structures with the rhenium homologues opens a path into molecular theranostics.

         <title>Photobase&#8208;Driven Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in a Strapped &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>

         <dc:description>
A pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore acts as a photobase to induce strap&#8208;to&#8208;&#960; excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) from a strapped ammonium moiety. This new design of an ESIPT fluorophore, which is suitable for use in acidic media, produces a significantly red&#8208;shifted orange emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.







Abstract
We report a new design strategy for an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore that can be used in acidic media. A photobasic pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore is combined with a basic trialkylamine &#8220;strap&#8221;. In the presence of an acid, protonation occurs predominantly at the amine moiety in the ground state. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a pre&#8208;organized intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure between the resulting ammonium moiety and the pyridine ring. Upon excitation, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transition increases the basicity of the pyridine moiety in the excited state, resulting in proton transfer from the amine to the pyridine moiety. Consequently, the fluorophore takes on a polymethine&#8208;dye character in the ESIPT state, which gives rise to significantly red&#8208;shifted emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Characterising a Weak Halogen Bond in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very weak halogen bonds are excessively difficult to characterise in solution. We present an approach for the detailed NMR spectroscopic description of very weak interactions, providing the solution ensemble of the flexible model compound, the accurate geometry of the binding sites and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters. Here NOE abbreviates nuclear Overhauser effect, RDC corresponds to residual dipolar coupling, and &#916;T indicates variable temperature experiments.







Abstract
Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8208;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE&#8208; and RDC&#8208;based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.

CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ/pp structures of mercury oxides. The Hg&#8722;Hg bond of OHgHgO is shorter than that of HgHgO, similar to the Hg+(CN)2 system. Besides the broad absorption at &#8764;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 of &#8722;(HgO)n&#8722; in reactions of Hg and O2, HgO appeared at 521.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1, compared to 828.0 and 619.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for PtO and AuO. The band at 676&#8197;cm&#8722;1 observed in reactions of Hg and O3 was assiged to HgHgO.







Abstract
An investigation of pulsed&#8208;laser&#8208;ablated Zn, Cd and Hg metal atom reactions with HCN under excess argon during co&#8208;deposition with laser&#8208;ablated Hg atoms from a dental amalgam target also provided Hg emissions capable of photoionization of the CN photo&#8208;dissociation product. A new band at 1933.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in the region of the CN and CN+ gas&#8208;phase fundamental absorptions that appeared upon annealing the matrix to 20&#8197;K after sample deposition, and disappeared upon UV photolysis is assigned to (Ar)nCN+, our key finding. It is not possible to determine the n coefficient exactly, but structure calculations suggest that one, two, three or four argon atoms can solvate the CN+ cation in an argon matrix with C&#8722;N absorptions calculated (B3LYP) to be between 2317.2 and 2319.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Similar bands were observed in solid krypton at 1920.5, in solid xenon at 1935.4 and in solid neon at 1947.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. H13CN reagent gave an 1892.3 absorption with shift instead, and a 12/13 isotopic frequency ratio&#8211;nearly the same as found for 13CN+ itself in the gas phase and in the argon matrix. The CN+ molecular ion serves as a useful infrared probe to examine Ng clusters. The following ion reactions are believed to occur here: the first step upon sample deposition is assisted by a focused pulsed YAG laser, and the second step occurs on sample annealing: (Ar)2++CN&#8594;Ar+CN+&#8594;(Ar)nCN+.

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rearrange and aromatise: After a thiourea derivative has been transformed to a benzothiazine heterocycle, thioquinoline heterocycles can be formed by gold catalysis. The stability of the products is represented by the low level in the railway, while the gold catalysis will help to overcome the energetic barrier represented by the mountains.

We have successfully isolated the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), which is an intermediate in the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and Si(OMe)4. By analyzing the reaction mechanism based on the reactivity of 1 and DFT calculations, we improved the catalytic system and synthesized various organic carbamates&#8212;including polyurethane raw materials&#8212;by using CO2 at 1&#8197;atm.

         <title>Being Positive is Not Everything &#8211; Experimental and Computational Studies on the Selectivity of a Self&#8208;Assembled, Multiple Redox&#8208;State Receptor that Binds Anions with up to Picomolar Affinities</title>

         <dc:description>
The interaction of a redox&#8208;active trinuclear, self&#8208;assembled Ru metallomacrocycle with oxo&#8208;anions is reported and its affinity for these anions and halides in different oxidation states is calculated, revealing both high affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for some guests) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1). Detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies on the host in each of its oxidation states, revealed that it binds anion guests by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions, including charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The interaction of the self&#8208;assembled trinuclear ruthenium bowl 13+, that displays three other accessible oxidation states, with oxo&#8208;anions is investigated. Using a combination of NMR and electrochemical experimental data, estimates of the binding affinities of 14+, 15+, and 16+ for both halide and oxo&#8208;anions were derived. This analysis revealed that, across the range of oxidation states of the host, both high anion binding affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for specific guests bound to 16+) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) were observed. As the crystal structure of binding of the hexafluorophosphate anion revealed that the host has two potential binding sites (named the &#945; and &#946; pockets), the host&#8208;guest properties of both putative binding sites of the bowl, in all of its four oxidation states, were investigated through detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies. These studies revealed that, due to the interplay of ion&#8208;ion interactions, charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, binding to the &#945; pocket is generally preferred, except for the case of the relatively large and lipophilic hexafluorophosphate anionic guest and the host in the highest oxidation states, where the &#946; pocket becomes relatively favourable. This analysis confirms that host&#8208;guest interactions involving structurally complex supramolecular architectures are driven by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions and, even in the case of charged binding pairs, simple ion&#8208;ion interactions alone cannot accurately define these recognition processes.

         <title>Tuning peptide structure and function through fluorobenzene stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides was developed. This enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with  ortho  ,  meta  or  para  relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant difference in potency and efficacy demonstrates how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C 18  ) precursors, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), are studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It is found that C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8208;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960; out  and &#960; in  ) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C 18  . However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) compared to C 18  . Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960; in  system, and the &#960; out  system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) with larger n  shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960; out  electron delocalization in the C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) and C 18  in terms of gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 4 and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120 &#181;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200 &#181;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method for studying enzyme&#8208;ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>An alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;Ru(II) polypyridine complex for targeted antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize clinical application of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), one of the most arduous challenges is how to render aPDT agents a high selectivity against bacterial pathogens. In light of the fact that amino group&#8208;containing lipids are rich on the outer surfaces of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, we herein constructed an alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;ruthenium (II) polypyridine complex (  Ru2  ) to preferentially label  Staphylococcus aureus  and methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) over mammalian cells via the amino&#8208;yne bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Thanks to the strong singlet oxygen generation ability,  Ru2  could photo&#8208;inactivate  S. aureus  and MRSA effectively and specifically. phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules also exist in mammalian cells but are not accessible for  Ru2  , leading to its poor binding/uptake and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark and upon irradiation towards mammalian cells as well as low hemolysis, all favorable for aPDT application.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 3  10  helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. Yet, the screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus.  1  H and  19  F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their  N  &#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 3  10  &#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle  19  F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@hydrogel system for antibacterial therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Here, we propose an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained&#8208;release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) was loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two-fold reduction to afford a doubly-reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18-crown-6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;-complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali-metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo-15-crown-5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent-separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8211;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two-fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six-membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X-ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in-depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Assemblies with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent supramolecular assembly systems with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties for the detection of analytes including metal ions, anions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and heparin are summarized according to their unique architectures, diverse functions, outstanding sensitivity, and excellent selectivity as sensing platforms. Furthermore, the additional advantages of the marriage between supramolecular assemblies and AIE features are highlighted, and opportunities, challenges, and development perspectives of the particular combination are also discussed.







Abstract
The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.

         <title>Understanding the Effects of Binders in Gas Sorption and Acidity of Aluminium Fumarate Extrudates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pinch of binder, a pinch of MOF: The effect of co&#8208;extruding aluminium fumarate with either clays or silica gel binders has been investigated. Textural, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques show the changes in porosity and surface sites, and CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms fitted an ideal Jensen&#8208;Seaton adsorption model. We have demonstrated the viability of extrusion for MOF extrudate formation and the changes associated to the process.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminium fumarate MOF with clays or SiO2 gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO2 selectivity towards CH4, of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process. Moreover, probe FTIR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.

         <title>Z&#8208;scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction for boosting photo&#8208;oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide under ambient conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In  2  S  3  show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalysis property is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalysis reveal that the superoxide radical (&#8226;O  2  &#8208;  ) and singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  , an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a  Z  &#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  methyl ester in 13% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of  S. aureus  and zymosan A bioparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Coexistence of Tellurium Cations and Anions in Phosphonium&#8208;based Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental tellurium readily dissolves in ionic liquids based on tetraalkylphosphonium cations even at temperatures below 100 &#176;C. In the case of ILs with acetate, decanoate, or dicyanamide anions, dark red to purple colored solutions form. A study combining NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of tellurium anions (Te  n  )  2&#8211;  with chain lengths up to at least  n  = 5, which are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. Since external influences could be excluded and no evidence of an ionic liquid reaction was found, disproportionation of the tellurium is the only possible dissolution mechanism. Although the spectroscopic detection of tellurium cations in these solutions is difficult, the coexistence of tellurium cations, such as (Te  4  )  2+  and (Te  6  )  4+  , and tellurium anions could be proven by cyclic voltammetry and electrodeposition experiments. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ILs are sufficient to stabilize both types of tellurium ions in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on utilizing two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activity for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. While bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced utilizing dual ligands in the whole   domino  process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ylide&#8208;stabilized phosphenium cations: Impact of the substitution pattern on the coordination chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Here, we report the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]  +  (with Y = Ph  3  PC(Ph), R = Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties. While the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y  2  P]  +  formed the expected LAuCl]  +  complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from enantiomeric helic[6]arenes, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes is developed, which subsequently provided a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes in almost quantitative yields. Moreover, the chirality transfer in the chiral [1]rotaxanes is also observed.







Abstract
Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combined with DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.

         <dc:description>Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;&#8208;bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom or heterocycle containing substrates. The base&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation induced emission leading to white light emission in diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8208;A groups or energy transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Calixarenes incorporating sulfonamide moieties: versatile ligands for carbonic anhydrases inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki  values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and Molecular Modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaching new biocatalytic reactivity using continuous flow reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of the Conformational Space of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Quadruplex RG&#8208;1 by Cellular Components and the Amyloidogenic Peptides &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and hIAPP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid&#8208;19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG&#8208;1 RNA&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N&#8208;gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type&#8208;II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG&#8208;1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG&#8208;1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies. These results may therefore shed more light on the relationship between PD as well as T2DM and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 disease and their molecular underpinnings. Since dysregulation of G4Q formation by rationally designed targeting compounds affects the control of cellular processes, this study should contribute to the development of specific ligands for intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin Metathesis in Confinement: Towards Covalent Organic Framework Scaffolds for Increased Macrocyclization Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer vast structural and chemical diversity enabling a wide and growing range of applications. While COFs are well&#8208;established as heterogeneous catalysts, so far, their high and ordered porosity has scarcely been utilized to its full potential when it comes to spatially confined reactions in COF pores to alter the outcome of reactions. Here, we present a highly porous and crystalline, large&#8208;pore COF as catalytic support in a,w&#8208;diene ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions, leading to increased macrocylization selectivity. COF pore&#8208;wall modification by immobilization of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8208;type catalyst via a mild silylation reaction provides a molecularly precise heterogeneous metathesis catalyst. An increased macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) selectivity over oligomerization (O) for the heterogeneous COF&#8208;catalyst (MMC:O = 1.35) of up to 51% compared to the homogeneous catalyst (MMC:O = 0.90) was observed along with a substrate&#8208;size dependency in selectivity, pointing to diffusion limitations induced by the pore confinement.</dc:description>

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group&#160;P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is p&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P.&#160;In situ&#160;studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.</dc:description>

         <title>Piers' Borane Induced Tetramerization of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the reaction of Piers' borane, i.e. HB(C 6 F 5 ) 2 , with an excess of arylacetylenes at room temperature leads to tetramerization of the acetylene and the diastereoselective formation of boryl&#8208;substituted tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes. The reaction mechanism was investigated by isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations. These investigations indicate that a series of 1,2&#8208;carboboration reactions form an octatetraene that undergoes an electrocyclization. Two skeletal rearrangements then presumably lead to the formation of the tetrahydropentalene core. Overall, this intricate and unprecedented transformation comprises five carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations in a single reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Channel Engineering for Rapid Ion Transport: From Nature to Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion transport behaviours through cell membranes are commonly identified in biological systems, which are crucial for sustaining life for organisms. Similarly, ion transport is significant for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Rapid ion transport can be well achieved by crystal channels engineering, such as creating pores or tailoring interlayer spacing downwards nanometres or even sub&#8208;nanometre scales. Furthermore, some functional channels, such as ion selective channels and stimulus&#8208;responsive channels, are developed for smart ion storage applications. In this review, the typical ion transport phenomena in the biological systems, including ion channels and pumps, are first introduced, and then ion transport mechanisms in solid and liquid crystals are comprehensively reviewed, particularly for the widely studied porous inorganic/organic hybrid crystals and ultrathin inorganic materials. Subsequently, recent progress on the ion transport properties in electrodes and electrolytes is reviewed for rechargeable batteries. Finally, current challenges in the ion transport behaviours in rechargeable batteries are analysed and some potential research approaches, such as bioinspired ultrafast ion transport structures and membranes, are proposed for future studies. It is expected that this review can give a comprehensive understanding on the ion transport mechanisms within crystals and provide some novel design concepts on promoting electrochemical ion storage capability in rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C60 dyad as a photosensitizer for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C  60  dyad (  BP&#8208;C  60  ) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatments and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications.  BP&#8208;C  60  is constituted by a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a fullerene C  60  moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. BOPHY core works as a visible light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C  60  subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8208;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C  60  . Photodynamic studies indicate that  BP&#8208;C  60  produces ROS by both photomechanisms (Type I and Type II), even it presents a higher ROS production efficiency than its constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models demonstrated the capability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C  60  dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency and relatively low cost. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in&#8208;situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.</dc:description>
