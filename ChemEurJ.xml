      <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble NHC&#8208;capped permethylated cyclodextrins with encapsulated copper(I), silver(I), or gold(I) complexes were used as catalysts in neat water for hydration, lactonization, hydroarylation, and cycloisomerization reactions. The cavity of these ligands induced high regioselectivity in hydroarylations, and high enantioselectivities in gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions giving up to 98&#8201;% ee in water.

      <title>Guest Recognition Control Accompanied by Stepwise Gate&#8208;Closing and Opening of a Macrocyclic Metallohost</title>
      <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest binding behavior of macrocyclic hosts is significantly influenced by the shapes and sizes of the hosts. In particular, closing/opening the apertures of the hosts controls the guest uptake/release. We utilized the post&#8208;metalation modification method, which we have recently developed, to achieve the open/close conversions. The starting open complex, [LCo 2 (pip) 4 ](OTf) 2 , was efficiently converted to the closed complex, [LCo 2 (hda) 2 ](OTf) 2 , which has a doubly&#8208;bridged structure. The conversion of this closed complex to the open complex [LCo 2 (hda) 2 (OAc)] + was too slow to be completed, but this gate&#8208;opening was dramatically accelerated by the addition of Na + . The Na + binding was also significantly enhanced by the gate&#8208;opening, e.g., conversion of [LCo 2 (hda) 2 ] 2+ to [LCo 2 (hda) 2 (OAc)] + .</dc:description>

      <title>Concentration&#8208;dependent interactions of amphiphilic PiB&#8208; derivative metal complexes with amyloid peptides A&#946; and amylin</title>
      <dc:description>Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. The attachment of a metal complex to amyloid recognition units typically leads to a decrease in peptide affinity. We show here that by separating a macrocyclic GdL chelate and a PiB targeting unit with a long hydrophobic C10 linker, it is possible to attain nanomolar affinities for both A&#946;  1&#8208;40  (  K  d  = 4.4 nM) and amylin (  K  d  = 4.5 nM), implicated respectively in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and diabetes. The Scatchard analysis of surface plasmon resonance data obtained for a series of amphiphilic, PiB derivative GdL complexes indicate that their A&#946;  1&#8208;40  or amylin binding affinity varies with their concentration, thus micellar aggregation state. The GdL chelates also affect peptide aggregation kinetics, as probed by thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence assays. A 2D NMR study allowed identifying that the hydrophilic region of A&#946;  1&#8208;40  is involved in the interaction between the monomer peptide and the Gd  3+  complex. Finally,  ex vivo  biodistribution experiments were conducted in healthy mice by using  111  In labelled analogues.

      <title>Cationic Fe(II)&#8208;Triplex Forming Metallohelices as DNA Bulge Binders</title>
      <dc:description>Bulges are essential structural elements in nucleic acids. The detection and targeting of bulged DNA sequences are highly important. Small molecules capable of targeting DNA bulges have attracted considerable attention because they can be used not only as reagents for bulge recognition but also as potential therapeutic drugs. Here we report on the interaction of DNA duplexes containing bulges of various sizes and base compositions with a series of Fe(II)&#8208;triplex forming metallohelices. The results obtained with the aid of the methods of molecular biophysics show that the investigated metallohelices prefer binding to bulged over double&#8208;stranded DNA and that their binding affinities towards bulges differ among individual metallohelices. Moreover, their binding affinities towards bulges strongly depend on the bulge size and the base composition of the bulge loop. The investigated metallohelices can enter eukaryotic cells and accumulate in the cell nucleus, allowing them to interact with nucleic acids. Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that the interaction of the metallohelices with nucleic acids bulges might contribute to the mechanism of their biological activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Dendritic oligoglycerol regioisomer mixtures and their utility for membrane protein research</title>
      <dc:description>Dendrons are an important class of macromolecules that can be used for a broad range of applications. Recent studies indicated that mixtures of oligoglycerol detergent (OGD) regioisomers are superior over individual regioisomers for protein extraction. The origin of this phenomenon remains puzzling. Here we discuss the synthesis and characterization of dendritic oligoglycerol regioisomer mixtures and their implementation into detergents. We provide experimental benchmarks to support quality control after synthesis and investigate the unusual utility of OGD regioisomer mixtures for extracting large protein quantities from biological membranes. We anticipate that our findings will enable the development of mixed detergent platforms in the future.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorescence Response and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Tweezer&#8208;Type Synthetic Receptor Triggered by Complexation with Heme and Its Catabolites</title>
      <dc:description>There is increasing interest in development and applications of synthetic receptors that recognize target biomolecules in aqueous media. We have developed a new tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor that exhibits a significant fluorescence response upon the complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. The synthetic receptor consists of a tweezer&#8208;type heme recognition site and sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore. The receptor&#8208;heme complex exhibits a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates, and both the tweezer moiety and the sulfo&#8208;Cy5 moiety are important for this property. The synthetic receptor also exhibits significant fluorescence responses to biliverdin and bilirubin, but shows very weak fluorescence responses to flavin mononucleotide, folic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which contain smaller &#960;&#8208;scaffolds.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: The Xanthate Route to Indolines, Indoles, and their Aza Congeners</title>
      <dc:description>
Convergent routes to a variety of indolines, indoles, oxindoles, and their aza analogues involving radical additions of xanthates are described while discussing three different approaches. The first is the least general and relies on the generation of aryl or heteroaryl radicals starting from diazonium salts. The second involves radical addition to N&#8208;allylanilines followed by ring&#8208;closure onto the aromatic core. The last approach hinges on the direct modification of indoles by radical addition to the pyrrole subunit of the indole nucleus. For more information, see the Review by S. Zard et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;12689&#8197;ff.

      <title>Iminophosphorano&#8208;substituted Bispyridinylidenes: Redox Potentials and Substituent Constants from Tolman Electronic Parameters</title>
      <dc:description>Bispyridinylidenes (BPYs) have emerged as an important class of neutral organic electron donors, with redox potentials that vary widely with choice of substituent. Methods to predict the effect of substitution on the redox potential are therefore highly desirable. Here we show that the redox potential of BPYs featuring iminophosphorano substituents (R  3  P=N&#8208;), which represent the most reducing class of BPYs, can be predicted based on the well&#8208;known Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) for the respective phosphine fragment (R  3  P). Moreover, building on earlier work relating redox potentials to Hammett&#8208;type substituent constants, it is now possible to quantitatively predict &#963;  p  +  values for iminophosphorano substituents from TEP values. These results provide a path for precisely tailoring redox potentials of iminophosphorano&#8208;substituted BPYs, but also give quantitative descriptors for how these highly versatile iminophosphorano substituents can impact the properties of any molecular scaffold.</dc:description>

      <title>Divergent Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Yaku&#8217;amide B and Its Seven E/Z Isomers</title>
      <dc:description>Yaku&#8217;amide B (1) inhibits cancer cell growth through a unique mechanism of action. Compound  1  binds to mitochondrial FoF1&#8208;ATP synthase, inhibits ATP production, and enhances ATP hydrolysis. The presence of one (E)&#8208; and two (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroisoleucines (&#916;Ile) in the linear 13&#8208;mer sequence is the most unusual structural feature of  1. To uncover the biological importance of these residues, we synthesized  1  and its seven  E/Z  isomers  2&#8211;8  by devising a new divergent solid&#8208;phase strategy. Both the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;&#916;Ile residues were stereoselectively constructed by traceless Staudinger ligation on resin to ultimately deliver  1&#8211;8. All isomers  2&#8211;8  displayed the effects on inhibition of cell growth and ATP production, and enhancement of ATP hydrolysis, indicating that  2&#8211;8  share the same mode of action as  1. The least potent isomer  8  was isomeric at the three &#916;Ile residues of the most potent  1. These findings together indicate that the  E/Z&#8208;stereochemistry of the three &#916;Ile residues control the magnitude of the biological functions of  1.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yaku&#8217;amide B (1) inhibits cancer cell growth through a unique mechanism of action. Compound  1  binds to mitochondrial FoF1&#8208;ATP synthase, inhibits ATP production, and enhances ATP hydrolysis. The presence of one (E)&#8208; and two (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroisoleucines (&#916;Ile) in the linear 13&#8208;mer sequence is the most unusual structural feature of  1. To uncover the biological importance of these residues, we synthesized  1  and its seven  E/Z  isomers  2&#8211;8  by devising a new divergent solid&#8208;phase strategy. Both the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;&#916;Ile residues were stereoselectively constructed by traceless Staudinger ligation on resin to ultimately deliver  1&#8211;8.

      <title>Control of Axial Chirality by Planar Chirality Based on Optically Active [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral X&#8208;shaped molecules based on the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane have been prepared, in which di(methoxy)terphenyl units are stacked on the central benzene rings. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, methoxyphenyl rings freely rotate in solution, while at &#8722;120&#8201;&#176;C, their rotary motion is suppressed in the excited state. The X&#8208;shaped molecules emit CPL at 25&#8201;&#176;C in solution with a large glum value. On the other hand, at &#8722;120&#8201;&#176;C, dual CPL emission with opposite signs is observed. The axial chirality is controlled by the planar chirality at low temperature, leading ultimately to propeller chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Morisaki et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003188).

Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells have been fabricated for the first time from graphene quantum dots (GQDs) sandwiched by ITO and Al electrodes, to display a broad and strong white emission. The GQDs have been fabricated in gram scale from electrochemical exfoliation of graphite and studied in electrochemiluminescence to gain insight into their optoelectronic characteristics. It is anticipated to use the GQDs in lighting applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Ding et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003395).

Three birds with one stone: New therapies are needed to facilitate synergistic combinations that span distinct antitumor mechanisms. A small library of structurally relevant C,N&#8208;cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes was synthesized and their pharmacologic efficacy was investigated. The cover art shows the structure of the complex Ru8, which was demonstrated to have three antitumor functions, including potent cytotoxicity, antimetastasis and antivascular activity.

      <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8211;Vanadium Oxide Nanozymes for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
One&#8208;step assembly of tannic acid and metavanadate led to the formation of a type of nanozyme comprising natural polyphenol&#8208;hybrided mixed valence vanadium oxide nanosheets (TA@VOx NSs). In this nanosystem, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of VOx provides the possibility to achieve tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy (CDT). As a valid supplement to CDT, NIR absorption ensures that TA@VOx NSs can realize NIR light&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT). Such combination of chemodynamic and photothermal activities means that TA@VOx NSs can be applied for effective synergistic CDT/PTT of cancers. More information can be found in the Full Paper by X.&#8208;C. Shen, B.&#8208;P. Jiang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002335).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One&#8208;step assembly of tannic acid and metavanadate&lt;/b&gt; led to the formation of a type of nanozyme comprising natural polyphenol&#8208;hybrided mixed valence vanadium oxide nanosheets (TA@VO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; NSs). In this nanosystem, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of VO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; provides the possibility to achieve tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy (CDT). As a valid supplement to CDT, NIR absorption ensures that TA@VO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; NSs can realize NIR light&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT). Such combination of chemodynamic and photothermal activities means that TA@VO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; NSs can be applied for effective synergistic CDT/PTT of cancers. More information can be found in the Full Paper by X.&#8208;C. Shen, B.&#8208;P. Jiang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200233510.1002/chem.202002335&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Tetrazole Azasydnone (C2N7O2H) and Its Salts: High&#8208;Performing Zwitterionic Energetic Materials Containing a Unique Explosophore</title>
      <dc:description>
The first compound containing both a tetrazole and an azasydnone ring, a unique energetic material, is reported. Several energetic salts of the tetrazole azasydnone were synthesized and characterized, leading to the creation of new secondary and primary explosives. Molecular structures are confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The high heats of formation, fast detonation velocities, and straightforward synthesis of energetic azasydnones should capture the attention of future energetics research.

      <title>Synthesis and Coordination Behavior of a New Hybrid Bidentate Ligand with Phosphine and Silylene Donors</title>
      <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and coordination behavior of a new mixed donor ligand PhC(NtBu)  2  SiC  6  H  4  PPh  2  (  1  ) containing both silylene and phosphine donor sites. Ligand (  1  ) was synthesized from a reaction of ortho&#8208;lithiated diphenylphosphinobenzene (LiC  6  H  4  PPh  2  ) with chlorsilylene (PhC(NtBu)  2  SiCl). Reaction of  1  with Se and GeCl  2  resulted in Si(IV) compounds  2  and  3  by selective oxidation of silylene donor. This strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligand induces dissociation of CuCl and PhBCl  2  leading to formation of ionic complexes  4  and  5  respectively. The reaction of  1  with ZnCl  2 &#173;  and AlCl  3  resulted in the formation of chelate complex  5  and  7  , respectively, while the reaction with EtAlCl  2  and GaCl  3  forms monodentate complexes  8  and  9  . X&#8208;ray analysis of  4  showed that the copper is in the spiro center of the two five&#8208;membered rings. Moreover, the copper(I)chloride has not been oxidized but dissociates to Cu  +  and [CuCl  2  ]  &#173;&#173;&#8208;  . All the compounds are well characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Study of excited states and electron transfer of semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;complex hybrid photocatalysts for CO2 reduction using picosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies</title>
      <dc:description>We have previously reported on a semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;complex hybrid photocatalyst for CO2 reduction composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped Ta2O5 as a semiconductor photosensitizer and Ru complex as a CO2 reduction catalyst that operates under visible light (&gt; 400 nm) with high selectivity for HCOOH formation of more than 75 %. The electron transfer from a photoactive semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst is a key process for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with hybrid photocatalysts. To understand the mechanism of electron transfer from a semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst, here we describe the excited&#8208;state dynamics of several hybrid photocatalysts using time&#8208;resolved emission and infrared absorption spectroscopies. Our results show that electron transfer from the semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst does not directly occur upon photoexcitation, but that the photoexcited electron transfers to a new excited state. Based on the present results and previous reports, we suggest that the excited state is a charge transfer state located between shallow defects of the semiconductor and the metal&#8208;complex catalyst.</dc:description>

Entropic mixing of two or more derivatives of highly similar dye molecules results in thin films showing almost solution&#8208;like photophysical properties. Mixed films of new, low molecular weight BODIPY dyes, with short alkyl chains in the &#945;&#8208;position, were fabricated and furthermore used in an optical cavity, where the strong coupling regime was reached.

     alt="Entropic Mixing Allows Monomeric&#8208;Like Absorption in Neat BODIPY Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entropic mixing&lt;/b&gt; of two or more derivatives of highly similar dye molecules results in thin films showing almost solution&#8208;like photophysical properties. Mixed films of new, low molecular weight BODIPY dyes, with short alkyl chains in the &#945;&#8208;position, were fabricated and furthermore used in an optical cavity, where the strong coupling regime was reached. More information can be found in the Communication by K. B&#246;rjesson et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200246310.1002/chem.202002463&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Synthesis, structure and properties of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;6</title>
      <dc:description>Pure silica zeolites possessing uniform micropores, large surface area and high thermal and chemical stability have been widely studied and used in the fields of fine chemicals and oil industry. The incorporation of Al into the framework of silica zeolites changes their properties, making them more industrially useful as adsorbents and catalysts. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;6 with a 16&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pore channel. The Al was directly incorporated into the zeolite NUD&#8208;6 framework, which was confirmed by  27  Al MAS NMR studies and ammonia temperature&#8208;programmed desorption probes. Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 was not stable when heated at 550&#176;C to remove the organic templates. However, the organic templates in Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 could be removed by oxidation in nitric acid at room temperature. The obtained Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6H retained the crystalline structure and possessed both micropores and mesopores despite the occurrence of severe structural distortions due to the presence of the corner&#8208;sharing Q  3  Si  2  O  7  units. The incorporation of Al resulted in both medium and strong acid sites in Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6H, and could facilitate its use in adsorption and catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>A Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Synthesized in a Deep Eutectic Solvent for Dye Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>Instead of the use of organic solvents, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of tetrabutylammonium bromide and imidazole (Bu 4  NBr/Im) was employed as a solvent for the first time to synthesize covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Due to the low vapor pressure of the Bu 4  NBr/Im&#8208;based DES, a new carboxyl&#8208;functionalized COF (TpPa&#8208;COOH) was synthesized under the environmental pressure. The as&#8208;synthesized TpPa&#8208;COOH has open channels and the DES can be removed completely from the pores. The dye adsorption performance of TpPa&#8208;COOH was examined for three organic dyes with similar molecular sizes, including one anionic dye (eosin B, EB) and two cationic dyes (methylene blue, MB; safranine T, ST). TpPa&#8208;COOH showed an excellent selective adsorption effect on MB and ST. The electronegative keto form in TpPa&#8208;COOH may help to form electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the &#960;&#8211;stacking frameworks of TpPa&#8208;COOH and the positive plane MB and ST molecules. The adsorption isotherms of MB and ST on TpPa&#8208;COOH were further investigated in detail and the equilibrium adsorption was well&#8208;modeled by using Langmuir isotherm model. Together with hydrogen bonding, TpPa&#8208;COOH showed higher adsorption capacity for ST than that for MB (1135 vs 410 mg/g).

      <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from d10 Metal Carbene Complexes via Intermolecular Charge Transfer and Multicolor Emission with a Monomer&#8208;Dimer Equilibrium</title>
      <dc:description>We report a series of two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) and Cu(I) complexes (3a&#8211;3b and 5a&#8211;5b) as new organometallic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which were based on the carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;carbazole model with pyridine&#8208;fused&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene (PyTz) ligand. The PyTz features small steric hindrance and low&#8208;energy LUMO (LUMO = &#8211;1.47 eV) locating over the &#960;* orbitals of the whole ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular charge transfer (CT) between a donor (carbazole) and an accepter (PyTz). These compounds exhibit efficient TADF with microsecond lifetimes. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL kinetics of 3a supports a rather small energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;ES1&#8211;T1 = 60 meV). Further experiments reveal that there exist dual&#8208;emission properties from a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in the solution, exhibiting single&#8208;component multicolor emission from blue to orange including white&#8208;light emission.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights on the Pseudo&#8208;Enantiomeric Properties of Bifunctional Cinchona Alkaloid Squaramide&#8208;derived Organocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The use of pseudo enantiomers is a well&#8208;known method of achieving products of complementary stereochemistry. Only rarely can different enantiomers of a product be accessed without modulation of the catalyst. Recently, a system was reported wherein two different enantiomers of spirocycles were obtained by a cascade reaction of unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones with mercaptoacetaldehyde catalyzed by a single optimized cinchona alkaloid squaramide&#8208;derived organocatalyst. It was originally proposed that the  E  &#8208;/  Z  &#8208;geometry of the unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one dictated the stereochemistry of the spirocycle product, but this was not investigated further. In the present work, we have investigated the nature of a pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric organocatalyst conformation applying density functional theory calculations for investigating the transition states for the reaction. Furthermore, the influence of the double&#8208;bond geometry of the pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one has been studied beyond what is possible to test experimentally. The results provide a greater understanding for this class of reactions that may be applicable in future methodology development.</dc:description>

      <title>Stabilization of Black Phosphorus using Sonication&#8208;Assisted Simultaneous Exfoliation&#8208;Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Black Phosphorus (BP) displays extraordinary properties but its ambient instability remains a critical challenge. Functionalization has been employed to overcome the sensitivity of BP to ambient conditions while preserving its properties. Here, we report a simultaneous exfoliation&#8208;functionalization process that functionalizes BP flakes during exfoliation, hence providing increased protection which can be attributed to the minimal exposure of flakes to ambient oxygen and water. A tetrabutylammonium salt was employed for the intercalation of BP, resulting in the formation of flakes with large lateral dimensions. The addition of an aryl iodide or an aryl iodonium salt to the exfoliation solvent creates a scalable strategy for the production of functionalized few&#8208;layer BP flakes. The ambient stability of functionalized BP was prolonged to a period of 1 week compared to unfunctionalized BP, as characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</dc:description>

Thus, with  t  BuLi, an unprecedented addition to C5 of bipy, a regiochemistry non&#8208;accessible for free bipy, was obtained, while coordinated phen underwent  t  BuLi addition to C2 and C4. Remarkably, when LiHBEt  3  reacted with [Re(bipy)(CO)  3  (PMe  3  )]OTf, hydride addition to the 4 and 6 positions of bipy triggered an intermolecular cyclodimerization of two dearomatized pyridyl rings. In contrast, hydride addition to the phen analog resulted on partial reduction of one pyridine ring. The resulting neutral Re(I) products showed a varied reactivity with HOTf and with MeOTf to yield cationic complexes. These strategies rendered access to Re(I) complexes containing bipy&#8208; and phen&#8208;derived chelates with several C(sp  3  ) centers.</dc:description>

      <title>Saccharide Recognition by a Three Arm&#8208;Shaped Host Having Preorganized Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Generally, cage&#8208;shaped hosts for saccharides can strongly bind to guest molecules owing to the three&#8208;dimensional preorganized hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, the preparation of cage molecules is often difficult due to the low&#8208;yield macrocyclization step. Here, we report a three arm&#8208;shaped molecule possessing pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol units as a new kind of host having a preorganized three&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonding site. This three arm&#8208;shaped host was readily prepared compared to a cage&#8208;shaped analogue.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generally, cage&#8208;shaped hosts for saccharides can strongly bind to guest molecules owing to the three&#8208;dimensional preorganized hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, the preparation of cage molecules is often difficult due to the low&#8208;yield macrocyclization step. Here, we report a three arm&#8208;shaped molecule possessing pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol units as a new kind of host having a preorganized three&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonding site. This three arm&#8208;shaped host was readily prepared compared to a cage&#8208;shaped analogue. This host associated with lipophilic glycosides to form chiral complexes, and the association constants were sufficiently high as well as those of the cage&#8208;shaped one. Furthermore, this host extracted native monosaccharides into a lipophilic solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthetically Versatile Nitrogen Acyclic Carbene stabilized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received significant attention as gold nanoparticle stabilizers due to their strong binding affinity towards gold. However, their tunability is limited by the difficulty in obtaining nonsymmetric NHCs.

The nanoparticles display good stability at elevated temperatures and for extended periods both dried or dispersed in a medium, as well as in the presence of exogenous thiols.

      <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability and Photoisomerization of Azoheteroarenes through Macrocycle Strain</title>
      <dc:description>Azobenzene and its derivatives are one of the most&#8208;widespread molecular scaffolds in a range of modern applications, as well as in fundamental research. After photoexcitation, azo&#8208;based photoswitches revert back to the most stable isomer in a timescale ( [[EQUATION]] ) that determines the range of potential applications. Attempts to bring [[EQUATION]] to extreme values prompted to the development of azobenzene and azoheteroarene derivatives that either rebalance the E&#8208; and Z&#8208; isomer stabilities, or exploit unconventional thermal isomerization mechanisms. In the former case, one successful strategy has been the creation of macrocycle strain, which tends to impact the E/Z stability asymmetrically, and thus significantly modify [[EQUATION]] . On the bright side, bridged derivatives have shown an improved optical switching owing to the higher quantum yields and absence of degradation. However, in most (if not all) cases, bridged derivatives display a  reversed  thermal stability (more stable Z&#8208;isomer), and smaller [[EQUATION]] than the acyclic counterparts, which restricts their potential interest to applications requiring a fast forward and backwards switch. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alkyl bridges to the thermal stability of phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes using computational methods, and we reveal that is indeed possible to combine such improved photo&#8208;switching characteristics while preserving the  regular  thermal stability (more stable E&#8208;isomer), and increased [[EQUATION]] values under the appropriate connectivity and bridge length.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemoenzymatic synthesis of fluorinated cellodextrins identifies a new allomorph for cellulose&#8208;like materials</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the fine details of self&#8208;assembly of building blocks into complex hierarchical structures represents a major challenge  en route  to the design and preparation of soft matter materials with specific properties. Enzymatically synthesised cellodextrins are known to have limited water solubility beyond DP9, a point at which they self&#8208;assemble into particles resembling the antiparallel cellulose II crystalline packing. We have prepared and characterised a series of site selectively fluorinated cellodextrins of different degrees of fluorination and substitution patterns by chemoenzymatic synthesis. Bearing in mind the potential disruption of the hydrogen bond network of cellulose II, we have prepared and characterised a multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin. In addition, a series of single site selectively fluorinated cellodextrins were synthesised to assess the structural impact upon addition of one fluorine atom per chain. The structural characterisation of these materials at different length scales, combining advanced NMR and microscopy methods, showed that a 6&#8208;fluorinated donor substrate yielded multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin chains that assembled into particles presenting morphological and crystallinity features, and intermolecular interactions, that are unprecedented for cellulose&#8208;like materials.</dc:description>

      <title>BIAN&#8211;NHC Ligands in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalysis: A Perfect Union of Sterically&#8208;Encumbered, Electronically&#8208;Tunable N&#8211;Heterocyclic Carbenes?</title>
      <dc:description>The discovery of NHCs (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes) as ancillary ligands in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis ranks as one of the most important developments in synthesis and catalysis. It is now well&#8208;recognized that the strong&#963;&#8208;donating properties of NHCs along with the ease of scaffold modification and a steric shielding of the N&#8208;wingtip substituents around the metal center enable dramatic improvements in catalytic processes, including the discovery of reactions that are not possible using other ancillary ligands. In this context, although the classical NHCs based on imidazolylidene and imidazolinylidene ring systems are now well&#8208;established, recently tremendous progress has been made in the development and catalytic applications of BIAN&#8211;NHC (BIAN = bis(imino)acenaphtene) class of ligands. The enhanced reactivity of BIAN&#8211;NHCs is a direct result of the combination of electronic and steric properties that collectively allow for a major expansion of the scope of catalytic processes that can be accomplished using NHCs. BIAN&#8211;NHC ligands take advantage of (1) the stronger&#160;&#963;&#963;&#8208;donation, (2) lower lying LUMO orbitals, (3) the presence of an extended &#960;&#960;&#8208;system, (4) the rigid backbone that pushes the N&#8208;wingtip substituents closer to the metal center by buttressing effect, thus resulting in a significantly improved control of the catalytic center and enhanced air&#8208;stability of BIAN&#8211;NHC&#8211;metal complexes at low oxidation state.

      <title>Temperature as an extra dimension in multidimensional protein NMR.</title>
      <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a particularly informative method for studying protein structure and dynamics in solution; however, it is also one of the most time&#8208;consuming. Modern approaches to biomolecular NMR are based on lengthy multidimensional (ND) experiments whose duration grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. The experimental time may even be several days in the case of 3D and 4D spectra. Moreover, the experiment often has to be repeated in several different conditions, for example in order to measure the temperature&#8208;dependent effects in a spectrum (temperature coefficients, TCs). In this paper we propose a new approach that involves joint sampling of indirect evolution times and temperature. This allows us to measure TCs with 3D spectra in even less time than is needed to acquire a single spectrum using the conventional approach. We propose two signal processing methods that are complementary in terms of sensitivity and resolution: a) dividing the data into overlapping subsets followed by compressed sensing reconstruction, and b) treating the complete data set with a variant of the Radon transform. The temperature&#8208;swept 3D HNCO spectra of two intrinsically disordered proteins&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;osteopontin and CD44 cytoplasmic tail&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;show that our new approach makes it possible to determine TCs and their non&#8208;linearities effectively. Non&#8208;linearities, which indicate the presence of a compact state, are particularly interesting. We provide the complete package of data acquisition and processing software for this new approach.</dc:description>

      <title>Quinoline Photobasicity &#8211; Investigation within water&#8208;soluble light&#8208;responsive copolymers</title>
      <dc:description>Photobases exhibit a distinctly higher pK  a  in their excited state compared to the ground state, thus, enabling light&#8208;controlled proton transfer reactions. Their versatility in  e.g.  molecular catalysis routes in the dramatic change of the electronic configuration.

The integration of quinolines as photobase chromophores within copolymers offers new possibilities for light triggered proton transfer in nanostructured materials,  i.e.  , in nanoparticles, at surfaces, membranes and interfaces. To exploit the light&#8208;triggered reactivity of photobases within such materials, we first investigated how the ground and excited state properties of the quinoline unit changes upon polymer integration. To address this matter, we combine absorption and emission spectroscopy with time&#8208;resolved transient absorption studies to reveal photoinduced proton transfer dynamics in various solvents. The results yield important insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of these polymeric quinoline photobases.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8592;N&#8208;Incorporated Dibenzo&#8208;azaacene with Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Visible Transparency</title>
      <dc:description>Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semi&#8208;transparent opto&#8208;electronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39 eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856 nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41 nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380 nm to 760 nm. Thin films of QBNA&#8208;O exhibit the average visible transparency (AVT) of 78% at the thickness of 205 nm and 90% at the thickness of 45 nm. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) of QBNA&#8208;O display ambipolar transporting behavior with the electron mobility of 0.52 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and the hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 together with excellent air&#8208;stability. The selective NIR absorbing property and excellent charge transporting property imply that QBNA&#8208;O can be used to fabricate transparent organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semi&#8208;transparent opto&#8208;electronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39 eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856 nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41 nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380 nm to 760 nm. Thin films of QBNA&#8208;O exhibit the average visible transparency (AVT) of 78% at the thickness of 205 nm and 90% at the thickness of 45 nm. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) of QBNA&#8208;O display ambipolar transporting behavior with the electron mobility of 0.52 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and the hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 together with excellent air&#8208;stability. The selective NIR absorbing property and excellent charge transporting property imply that QBNA&#8208;O can be used to fabricate transparent organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Microwave Detection of Wet Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP): Non&#8208;Covalent Forces and Water Dynamics</title>
      <dc:description>The microsolvated adducts of Triacetone triperoxide (TATP) have been observed using broadband rotational spectroscopy. This work opens a new way for the gas phase detection of this improvised explosive. The observed clusters exhibit unusual water dynamics and rarely observed multicenter interactions.

      <title>DpgC&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation of&#160; DPA&#8208;CoA: insights into the spin&#8208;forbidden transition and charge transfer mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a very strong oxidizing agent, most organic molecules are not oxidized in the presence of O$_2$ at room temperature because O$_2$ is a diradical while most organic molecules are closed&#8208;shell. Oxidation then requires a change in the spin state of the system, forbidden according to non&#8208;relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually rely on metal or redox cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of, at least, one oxygen atom into an organic substrate. However, some oxygenases do not require any cofactor, and the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes remains elusive. To fill this gap, here we study the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of&#160; 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) combining multi&#8208;reference calculations on a model system, with QM/MM calculations. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen. The characterization of the electronic states reveals that&#160; &#160;electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet&#8208;singlet transition. The enzyme plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water&#8208;wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations. Our results show that the stabilization of the singlet radical&#8208;pair between dioxygen and enolate is enough to promote spin&#8208;forbidden reaction without the need for neither metal cofactors nor basic residues in the active site.</dc:description>
