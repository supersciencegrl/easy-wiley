         <title>Acid&#8208;Tolerant Sulfate Tetrahedral Cages from Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular cages have been constructed by anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) in recent years and shown unique host&#8208;guest interactions. However, most of the reported cages are made of phosphate ion (PO43&#8722;), while other anions have rarely been explored. Here we show for the first time that sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) is also able to form the A4L4 tetrahedral motif with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, but this is dependent on the stoichiometry of sulfate ion (in solution). Notably, the sulfate cages display enhanced resistance for both Br&#248;nsted (pH as low as 4.3 in acetone containing 15% water) and Lewis acids (metal complexes) than the corresponding phosphate cages, and thus may find applications where acidic (proton or metals) environment is required.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Free Access to Polysubstituted Pyrimidines via Nitrile Activation and [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitriles were activated in presence of Tf2O into aza&#8208;allene species followed by an intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This process was evidenced by detailed deuteration experiments and competing reactions. A bidentate pyrimidine ligand was synthesized for preparation of a metal complex with pure blue luminescence at 470&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tf2O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidines and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf2O, aza&#8208;allene species were generated in&#8197;situ through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments. The reaction had good substrate extensibility with moderate to excellent yield including trimethylsilylalkynes. The method was utilized as a synthetic tool in the preparation of a luminescent metal complex.

         <title>Synthesis of a Negative Photochrome with High Switching Quantum Yields and Capable of Singlet Oxygen Production and Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dimethyldihydropyrene (DHP) photochromic unit has been functionalized by donor (triphenylamine group) and acceptor (methyl&#8208;pyridinium) substituents. This compound was characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies as well as cyclic voltammetry and its properties were rationalized by theoretical calculations. The incorporation of both electron donor and withdrawing groups on the photochromic center allows  i)  an efficient photo&#8208;isomerization of the system when illuminated at low energy (quantum yield: &#1060;  c&#8208;o  = 13.3% at &#955;  ex.  = 660 nm),  ii)  the reversible and quantitative formation of two endoperoxyde isomers when illuminated under aerobic conditions at room temperature and  iii)  the storage and production of singlet oxygen. The photo&#8208;isomerization mechanism was also investigated by spin&#8208;flip TD&#8208;DFT (SF&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hydro&#8208; and Organogelation by Minimalistic Diketopiperazines Containing a Highly Insoluble Aggregation&#8208;Induced, Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission Luminophore**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimalistic and highly efficient hydro&#8208; and organogelators were obtained by the combination of a highly insoluble luminophore capable of aggregation&#8208;induced blue shifted emission (AIBSE) with natural amino&#8208;acid derived diketopiperazines. The gelators were investigated with regard to their aggregation and gelation behavior, and their photophysical and material properties. The modular approach demonstrates a potent strategy to turn an otherwise poorly soluble polycyclic aromatic compound into hydro&#8208; and organogelators.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, gelation abilities and aggregation&#8208;induced, blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE) properties of two minimalistic diketopiperazine&#8208;based gelators. Despite containing a highly insoluble luminophore that makes up more than half of their respective molecular masses, efficient hydrogelation by multiple stimuli for one and efficient organogelation for the other compound are reported. Insights into the aggregation and gelation properties were gained through examination of the photophysical and material properties of selected gels, which are representative of the different modes of gelation. The synthesis of the gelators is highly modular and based on readily available amino acid building blocks, allowing the efficient and rapid diversification of these core structures and fine&#8208;tuning of gel properties.

         <title>The Roles of Composition and Mesostructure of Cobalt&#8208;Based Spinel Catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The particle anisotropy and cobalt content in spinel oxides is systematically varied and the impact on oxygen evolving reactions is investigated. For chemical and electrochemical water oxidation as well as H2O2 decomposition the reactivity changes with the cobalt&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio and the degree of anisotropy. Furthermore, the importance of the interplay of redox pairs and different active sites are highlighted.







Abstract
By using the crystalline precursor decomposition approach and direct co&#8208;precipitation the composition and mesostructure of cobalt&#8208;based spinels can be controlled. A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox&#8208;active iron and redox&#8208;inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co3O4, MgCo2O4, Co2FeO4, Co2AlO4 and CoFe2O4. The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation by using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H2O2 decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co3O4 and CoFe2O4 catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogues. For CAN&#8208;test and OER, Co3+ plays the major role for high activity. In H2O2 decomposition, Co2+ reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions. A benefit of a predominant 111 surface termination depends on the cobalt oxidation state in the as&#8208;prepared catalysts and the investigated reaction.

     alt="The Roles of Composition and Mesostructure of Cobalt-Based Spinel Catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The particle anisotropy&lt;/b&gt; and cobalt content in spinel oxides is systematically varied and the impact on oxygen evolving reactions is investigated. For chemical and electrochemical water oxidation as well as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition the reactivity changes with the cobalt-to-metal ratio and the degree of anisotropy. Furthermore, the importance of the interplay of redox pairs and different active sites are highlighted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the crystalline precursor decomposition approach and direct co-precipitation the composition and mesostructure of cobalt-based spinels can be controlled. A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox-active iron and redox-inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, MgCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation by using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogues. For CAN-test and OER, Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; plays the major role for high activity. In H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions.

         <title>Fast Detection of Entacapone by a Lanthanide&#8211;Organic Framework with Rhombic Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide&#8208;organic framework was synthesized to detect entacapone by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect.







Abstract
Entacapone (ENT) is a powerful catechol&#8208;O&#8208;methyl transferase inhibitor that is used for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's syndrome, but the amount used must be well controlled to avoid overtreatment and side effect. Fast and selective detection of ENT needs well&#8208;matched energy levels and well&#8208;designed sensor&#8208;ENT interaction which is highly challenging. In this work, a water stable europium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Eu&#8208;TDA) was synthesized to detect ENT by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity in the presence of main coexisting and interference species of plasma with a limit of detection of 5.01&#8197;&#956;M. The experimental results showed that the luminescence of Eu&#8208;TDA can be effectively quenched by ENT via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect mechanism in the system.

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring, ring! The reactivity of spiro&#8208;activated electrophilic cyclopropanes was studied by following the kinetics of their SN2&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening reactions with thiophenolate ions in DMSO at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The experimentally determined second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) correlated linearly with Mayr nucleophilicities N, basicities (pKaH), and Hammett substituent constants of the thiophenolates, but parabolic Hammett plots revealed variable electrophile&#8208;dependent effects on the stabilization of the transition states.







Abstract
The kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reactions of thiophenolates with geminal bis(acceptor)&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in DMSO at 20&#8201;&#176;C was monitored by photometric methods. The determined second&#8208;order rate constants of the SN2 reactions followed linear relationships with Mayr nucleophilicity parameters (N/sN) and Br&#248;nsted basicities (pKaH) of the thiophenolates as well as with Hammett substituent parameters (&#963;) for groups attached to the thiophenolates. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted by up to a factor of 15 faster than their unsubstituted analogues, in accord with the known activating effect of adjacent &#960;&#8208;systems in SN2 reactions. Variation of the electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, the inherent SN2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;systems because of the more advanced C1&#8722;C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems also lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.

         <title>Electrochemical Studies of CO2&#8208;Reducing Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only two enzymes are able to directly reduce CO2: the metalloenzymes formate dehydrogenase, which produces formate, and CO dehydrogenase, which produces carbon monoxide. We review studies in which these enzymes were connected to electrodes, either for applicative purposes or to learn about their catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Only two enzymes are capable of directly reducing CO2: CO dehydrogenase, which produces CO at a [NiFe4S4] active site, and formate dehydrogenase, which produces formate at a mononuclear W or Mo active site. Both metalloenzymes are very rapid, energy&#8208;efficient and specific in terms of product. They have been connected to electrodes with two different objectives. A series of studies used protein film electrochemistry to learn about different aspects of the mechanism of these enzymes (reactivity with substrates, inhibitors&#8230;). Another series focused on taking advantage of the catalytic performance of these enzymes to build biotechnological devices, from CO2&#8208;reducing electrodes to full photochemical devices performing artificial photosynthesis. Here, we review all these works.

         <dc:description>
A highly atom&#8208;economic intermolecular radical addition/cyclization and Se&#8208;group transfer strategy was developed for the efficient synthesis of Se&#8208;containing cyclopentenes under metal&#8208;free and peroxide&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
A novel intermolecular radical addition/cyclization and Se&#8208;group transfer reaction of terminal alkynes and unsaturated alkyl selenide is presented which offers a straightforward and facile approach for the synthesis of valuable Se&#8208;containing cyclopentenes. Remarkable features of this strategy include easily accessible starting materials, metal&#8208;free and peroxide&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, simple operation and broad substrate scope. More importantly, the reaction is easy to scale up and can be extended to the construction of six&#8208;membered carbon ring.

A convenient and efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component perfluoroalkylation/aminocarbonylation strategy for accessing &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides has been developed. A wide range of readily available substrates including amines (anilines, alkylamines, sulfonamide, sulfonyl hydrazide, hydrazine, and hydrazides), perfluoroalkyl halides, and unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds (alkyl olefins, alkynes, and alkyl allenes) were transformed into the corresponding &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides in moderate to high yields with good chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent carbonylation is one of the most efficient strategies to construct carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component perfluoroalkylation/aminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes with perfluoroalkyl halides, and amines was developed. A wide range of substrates, including anilines, alkylamines, sulfonamides, and hydrazines are all suitable reaction partners for this catalyst system, resulting in various &#946;&#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity. Furthermore, not only alkyl olefins, but also aliphatic alkynes, and even alkyl allenes can all be employed. Notably, several medical and bioactive related molecules are compatible here as well.

         <title>Contrasting the Mechanism of H2 Activation by Monomeric and Potassium&#8208;Stabilized Dimeric AlI Complexes: Do Potassium Atoms Exert any Cooperative Effect?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two is not better than one!. In this work, we determined that the dimeric, low&#8208;valent AlI complex (D) is not more reactive than the monomeric derivative (M) toward the activation of H2. Moreover, neither complicity between the two monomers in the dimeric complex nor cooperative effects by K+ atoms was observed in the activation mechanism. A complete characterization of the H2 activation process has been conducted, proffering insights that can be beneficial for future experimental realizations.







Abstract
Aluminyl anions are low&#8208;valent, anionic, and carbenoid aluminum species commonly found stabilized with potassium cations from the reaction of Al&#8208;halogen precursors and alkali compounds. These systems are very reactive toward the activation of &#963;&#8208;bonds and in reactions with electrophiles. Various research groups have detected that the potassium atoms play a stabilization role via electrostatic and cation
 interactions with nearby (aromatic)&#8208;carbocyclic rings from both the ligand and from the reaction with unsaturated substrates. Since stabilizing K&#8943;H bonds are witnessed in the activation of this class of molecules, we aim to unveil the role of these metals in the activation of the smaller and less polarizable H2 molecule, together with a comprehensive characterization of the reaction mechanism. In this work, the activation of H2 utilizing a NON&#8208;xanthene&#8208;Al dimer, [K{Al(NON)}]2 (D) and monomeric, [Al(NON)]&#8722; (M) complexes are studied using density functional theory and high&#8208;level coupled&#8208;cluster theory to reveal the potential role of K+ atoms during the activation of this gas. Furthermore, we aim to reveal whether D is more reactive than M (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the D complex toward the activation of H2. The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric complexes were found to be very close (around 33&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the nature of the energy barriers for the monomeric and dimeric complexes are inherently different. The former is dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants (and increased interaction energies between them). Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H2 distorts the most, usually over 0.77 
. Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies between the complexes and H2 are the main stabilizing components up to the respective transition states. The results suggest that the K+ atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their cooperative role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H2. Cooperation between the two monomers in D is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H2 is wholly disengaged.

         <title>Emerging Yttrium Phosphides with Tetrahedron Phosphorus and Superconductivity under High Pressures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, several unprecedented Y&#8208;P compounds are predicted. Strikingly, vertex&#8208;sharing P4 polyhedrons in Fd&#8208;3m YP2 are firstly found in crystals. Importantly, Pm&#8208;3m Y3P sets a new record for superconductivity of binary transition&#8208;metal phosphides.







Abstract
Metal phosphides have triggered growing interest for their exotic structures and striking properties. Hence, within advanced structure search and first&#8208;principle calculations, several unprecedented Y&#8722;P compounds (e.&#8201;g., Y3P, Y2P, Y3P2, Y2P3, YP2, and YP3) were identified under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain&#8208;like network, buckled layer, three&#8208;dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly, Fd&#8208;3m YP2 can be viewed as assemblage of diamond&#8208;like Y structure and rare vertex&#8208;sharing tetrahedral P4&#8197;units. Impressively, electron&#8208;phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that Pm&#8208;3m Y3P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature Tc of 10.2&#8197;K among binary transition metal phosphides. Remarkably, the EPC of Pm&#8208;3m Y3P mainly arises from the contribution of low&#8208;frequency soft phonon modes, whereas mid&#8208;frequency phonon modes of Fd&#8208;3m YP2 dominate. These results strengthen knowledge of metal phosphides and pave a way for seeking superconductive transition metal phosphides.

         <title>Exciton Coupling in Redox&#8208;Active Salen based Self&#8208;Assembled Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of redox&#8208;active Ni salen donors and Ru dimer acceptors affords a [2+2] rectangle for the shorter acceptor and a catenane for the longer acceptor. Catenane formation is dependent on solvent choice and concentration. Oxidation to form salen ligand radicals results in exciton coupling of the intense near&#8208;infrared intervalence charge transfer band confirming that the macrocycles remain intact upon oxidation.







Abstract
The incorporation of a redox&#8208;active nickel salen complex into supramolecular structures was explored via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with homobimetallic ruthenium complexes (bridged by oxalato or 5,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinato ligands). The self&#8208;assembly resulted in the formation of a discrete rectangle using the oxalato complex and either a rectangle or a catenane employing the larger naphthoquinonato complex.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self-assembly&lt;/b&gt; of redox-active Ni salen donors and Ru dimer acceptors affords a [2+2] rectangle for the shorter acceptor and a catenane for the longer acceptor. Catenane formation is dependent on solvent choice and concentration. Oxidation to form salen ligand radicals results in exciton coupling of the intense near-infrared intervalence charge transfer band confirming that the macrocycles remain intact upon oxidation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a redox-active nickel salen complex into supramolecular structures was explored via coordination-driven self-assembly with homobimetallic ruthenium complexes (bridged by oxalato or 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinato ligands). The self-assembly resulted in the formation of a discrete rectangle using the oxalato complex and either a rectangle or a catenane employing the larger naphthoquinonato complex. The formation of the interlocked self-assembly was determined to be solvent and concentration dependent. The electronic structure and stability of the oxidized metallacycles was probed using electrochemical experiments, UV-Vis-NIR absorption, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, confirming ligand radical formation. Exciton coupling of the intense near-infrared (NIR) ligand radical intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) bands provided further confirmation of the geometric and electronic structures in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy and High&#8208;Efficiency Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution of a {Mo3S4}&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect between a {Mo3S4} catalytic unit and a POM electron&#8208;collecting unit gives rise to highly efficient light&#8208;driven HER photocatalysis. Such behavior is directly correlated to the very high rate constant for electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the ThioPOM catalyst. Furthermore, the high stability of the catalytic system should be related to the protected {Mo3S4} cores within the dumbbell&#8208;like arrangement.







Abstract
Polyoxothiometalate ions (ThioPOM) are active hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) catalysts based on modular assembly built from electrophilic clusters {MoSx} and vacant polyoxotungstates. Herein, the dumbbell&#8208;like anion [{(PW11O39)Mo3S4(H2O)3(OH)}2]8&#8722; exhibits very high light&#8208;driven HER activity, while the active cores {Mo3S4} do not contain any exposed disulfido ligands, which were suspected to be the origin of the HER activity. Moreover, in the catalyst architecture, the two central {Mo3S4} cores are sandwiched by two {PW11O39}7&#8722; subunits that act as oxidant&#8208;resistant protecting groups and behave as electron&#8208;collecting units. A detailed photophysical study was carried out confirming the reductive quenching mechanism of the photosensitizer [Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ by the sacrificial donor triethanolamine (TEOA) and highlighting the very high rate constant of the electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the ThioPOM catalyst. Such results provide new insights into the field of molecular catalytic systems able to promote high HER activity.

         <title>Computational Study of Bridge Splitting, Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to PtII, and Reductive Elimination from PtIV: Route to Pincer&#8208;PtII Reagents with Chemical and Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory studies of bridge&#8208;splitting of [PtIIR2(SEt2)]2 (R = 4&#8208;tolyl) by bromoarenes containing nitrogen donor groups, subsequent intramolecular coordination assisted oxidative addition, and reductive elimination elucidate the mechanism for formation of mer&#8208;PtII(N,C,N)Br pincers via PtIV, where the pincers have applications in fundamental and applied chemistry. While the research covers the breaking of bridges, it has built a collaborative bridge between Utrecht and Hobart that has stood for over 30 years.

Landing to explore beneath the silvery reflection of the moon, the unusual air oxidation of silver was investigated, granting access to the homoleptic anion [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1). The crew compartment of the Lunar Lander illustrates the structure of 1 mimicking the heraldic Occitan Cross, symbol of Occitania, where this work was developed. Compound 1 reacts with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline leading to the organosilver(III) compound [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3], which is depicted in the descent stage of the Lunar Lander. Upon addition of aryl boron derivatives and base, [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3] undergoes aromatic trifluoromethylation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Nebra et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared absorbing properties are of great interest in organic semiconducting materials for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. A series of thienoquinoid&#8208;containing molecules are presented that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV, corresponding to a wavelength of 1700&#8197;nm. The key to the very small optical energy gaps is an efficient quinoid&#8208;aromatic resonance along the conjugated backbones that significantly reduces the bond length alternation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kawabata and K. Takimiya (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102663).

         <title>Breaking Symmetry Relaxes Structural and Magnetic Restraints, Suppressing QTM in Enantiopure Butterfly Fe2Dy2 SMMs**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
These 2 coordination clusters are similar but different both in the fine details of their structures as well as their magnetic behaviour. [Fe2Dy2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(Me&#8208;teaH)2(O2CPh)6], which normally forms with the racemic version of Me&#8208;teaH3 by using enantiopure ligand, allows access to the S&#8208;version, but for the R&#8208;version there is significant racemisation. Surprisingly, by using the synthesis of [Fe2Dy2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(Me&#8208;teaH)2(O2CPh)4(NO3)2] both enantiopure R&#8208; and S&#8208;compounds were obtained. In both cases breaking the symmetry of the parent compounds leads to enhanced SMM behaviour.







Abstract
The {Fe2Dy2} butterfly systems can show single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour, the nature of which depends on details of the electronic structure, as previously demonstrated for the [Fe2Dy2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(Me&#8208;teaH)2(O2CPh)6] compound, where the [N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;amino]&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (Me&#8208;teaH3) ligand is usually used in its racemic form. Here, we describe the consequences for the SMM properties by using enantiopure versions of this ligand and present the first homochiral 3d/4&#8201;f SMM, which could only be obtained for the S enantiomer of the ligand for [Fe2Dy2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(Me&#8208;teaH)2(O2CPh)6] since the R enantiomer underwent significant racemisation. To investigate this further, we prepared the [Fe2Dy2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(Me&#8208;teaH)2(O2CPh)4(NO3)2] version, which could be obtained as the RS&#8208;, R&#8208; and S&#8208;compounds. Remarkably, the enantiopure versions show enhanced slow relaxation of magnetisation. The use of the enantiomerically pure ligand suppresses QTM, leading to the conclusion that use of enantiopure ligands is a &#8220;gamechanger&#8221; by breaking the cluster symmetry and altering the intimate details of the coordination cluster's molecular structure.

         <title>Investigation of the Organocatalytic Chlorination of 2&#8208;Phenylpropanal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is a long&#8208;standing challenge in organocatalysis. This work sheds light on why such a seeming simple aminocatalytic reaction cannot deliver a stereocontrolled outcome.







Abstract
Results of an examination of the organocatalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of 2&#8208;phenylpropanal are described. Synthetic investigation including the screening of primary and secondary aminocatalysts, many different reaction conditions, and other &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes show that especially primary aminocatalysts can catalyze the formation of the &#945;&#8208;chloro branched aldehydes in good yields, but only with moderate enantioselectivities. In order to try to understand the challenge in obtaining high enantioselectivity for the aminocatalytic &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes a series of experimental investigations were performed employing 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a model system. These investigations have been coupled with computational investigations, which provided important insight into the moderate enantioselectivity of this chlorination reaction. Analysis of the reaction showed, that the lack of control over the selectivity of formation of the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;enamine intermediate, and the clustering of reaction barriers of possible reaction pathways help to rationalize difficulties in producing high enantioselectivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;expansion featuring bicyclic azetidinium intermediates, prepared from 2&#8208;(trifluoropropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) piperidines, provides an effective access to &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl azocanes. The opening of the azetidinium intermediate was achieved by various nucleophiles in an excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantiospecificity as well as in good yields.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl azocanes are accessible from 2&#8208;(trifluoropropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) piperidines by metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;expansion involving a bicyclic azetidinium intermediate. The opening of the azetidinium intermediate was achieved by various nucleophiles (amines, alcoholates, carboxylates, phosphonates, halides and pseudo&#8208;halides) with an excellent regio&#8208; diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity and in good yields. The relative configuration of the piperidines and azocanes were assigned and the deprotected azocanes offer opportunities for further derivatization.

         <title>Photoluminescence&#8208;Based Techniques for the Detection of Micro&#8208; and Nanoplastics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detection of micro&#8208; and nanoplastics (MNPs) lacks recognized quality&#8208;controlled protocols and consequently also of related legislation. Here, photoluminescence&#8208;based techniques that can represent a solution are discussed. Nile Red staining is now the most used strategy, but also recently proposed molecular and nanostructured fluorogenic probes (biocompatible and water soluble) are presented.







Abstract
The growing numbers related to plastic pollution are impressive, with ca. 70&#8201;% of produced plastic (&gt;350&#8197;tonnes/year) being indiscriminately wasted in the environment. The most dangerous forms of plastic pollution for biota and human health are micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;plastics (MNPs), which are ubiquitous and more bioavailable. Their elimination is extremely difficult, but the first challenge is their detection since existing protocols are unsatisfactory for microplastics and mostly absent for nanoplastics. After a discussion of the state of the art for MNPs detection, we specifically revise the techniques based on photoluminescence that represent very promising solutions for this problem. In this context, Nile Red staining is the most used strategy and we show here its pros and limitations, but we also discuss other more recent approaches, such as the use of fluorogenic probes based on perylene&#8208;bisimide and on fluorogenic hyaluronan nanogels, with the added values of biocompatibility and water solubility.

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Patterns of Aryl&#8208;Group Substituted Silanediols and &#8208;triols from Alkoxy&#8208; and Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and isolable silanols with various aromatic substituents (e.&#8201;g., naphthyl or phentanthrenyl) were obtained by hydrolysis of alkoxy&#8208; and chlorosilanes. The resulting compounds exhibit strong hydrogen bonds both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures showed &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions dominating the structures of the non&#8208;hydrolyzed precursor molecules. The resulting crystalline silanols exhibit hydrogen bonding with a variety of structural motifs depending on the substitution pattern on the Si atom.







Abstract
Organosilanols typically show a high condensation tendency and only exist as stable isolable molecules under very specific steric and electronic conditions at the silicon atom. In the present work, various novel representatives of this class of compounds were synthesized by hydrolysis of alkoxy&#8208; or chlorosilanes. Phenyl, 1&#8208;naphthyl, and 9&#8208;phenanthrenyl substituents at the silicon atom were applied to systematically study the influence of the aromatic substituents on the structure and reactivity of the compounds. Chemical shifts in 29Si NMR spectroscopy in solution, correlated well with the expected electronic situation induced by the substitution pattern on the Si atom. 1H NMR studies allowed the detection of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the alkoxides and the chlorosilanes are dominated by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of the aromatic systems, which are substituted by strong hydrogen bonding interactions representing various structural motifs in the respective silanol structures.

A heterojunction material combined with polyoxometalate is designed to remove complex pollutants from water. The results of the experiments show that a material with such structure has good photoreduction property for Cr(VI) and adsorption property for organic cation dyes.







Abstract
Wastewater treatment is of great significance to environmental remediation. The exploration of efficient and stable methods for wastewater treatment is still a challenging issue. Herein, a heterojunction material with photocatalysis and adsorption properties has been designed to remove the complex pollutants from wastewater. The heterojunction material (ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12, PW12=[PW12O40]3&#8722;) was synthesized by calcining the ZnTi&#8722;layered double hydroxide (ZnTi&#8208;LDH) intercalated with the Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate H3PW12O40. In the construction of ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12 it was found that the polyanionic PW12 remained unchanged in the process of forming the proposed heterojunction. The photochemical properties verify that heterojunction synergistic with PW12 facilitated the separation of photoproduced electron&#8208;hole pairs and thus suppressed the recombination. Therefore, ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12 exhibits excellent photocatalytic property, and the efficiency of Cr(VI) photoreduction reached more than 90&#8201;% in the first 3&#8197;min. Furthermore, the electrostatic force between the PW12 and cationic dyes makes ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12 having an outstanding adsorption performance for cationic dyes, such as rhodamine B, crystal violet and methyl blue. Such heterojunction material combined with polyoxometalate puts forward new insights for the design of functional materials for water treatment with low cost and high efficiency.

         <title>Light&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated Water&#8208;soluble Pseudorotaxanes Comprising a Cucurbit[7]uril and a Flavylium&#8208;based Axle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central trans&#8208;chalcone moiety forms pseudorotaxanes with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), in water. Irradiation of the chalcone under slightly acidic conditions triggers the formation of the fluorescent cationic flavylium form with displacement of the CB7 ring along the thread, defining a pH&#8208;dependent photoswitch for ring translocation with fluorescence read&#8208;out. The system returns to the initial trans&#8208;chalcone state in the dark through a series of consecutive reversible reactions characteristic of flavylium&#8208;based molecular switches.







Abstract
A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central chalcone moiety is shown to provide two independent binding sites with similar affinity for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) macrocycles in water as judged from NMR, UV&#8208;Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Association results in [2] and [3]pseudorotaxanes, which are both pH and photosensitive. Switching from the neutral chalcone to the cationic flavylium form upon irradiation at 365&#8197;nm under acidic conditions provided an enhanced CB7 association (K1:1 increases from 1.2&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 to 1.5&#215;108&#8197;M&#8722;1), limiting spontaneous on&#8208;thread cucurbituril shuttling. This co&#8208;conformational change in the [2]pseudorotaxane is reversible in the dark with kobs=4.1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;s&#8722;1. Threading the flavylium moiety into CB7 leads to a dramatic increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, from 0.29 in the free axle to 0.97 in the [2]pseudorotaxane and 1.0 in the [3]pseudorotaxane.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A linear double pyridinium-terminated&lt;/b&gt; thread comprising a central &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-chalcone moiety forms pseudorotaxanes with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), in water. Irradiation of the chalcone under slightly acidic conditions triggers the formation of the fluorescent cationic flavylium form with displacement of the CB7 ring along the thread, defining a pH-dependent photoswitch for ring translocation with fluorescence read-out. The system returns to the initial &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-chalcone state in the dark through a series of consecutive reversible reactions characteristic of flavylium-based molecular switches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A linear double pyridinium-terminated thread comprising a central chalcone moiety is shown to provide two independent binding sites with similar affinity for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) macrocycles in water as judged from NMR, UV-Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Association results in [2] and [3]pseudorotaxanes, which are both pH and photosensitive. Switching from the neutral chalcone to the cationic flavylium form upon irradiation at 365&#8197;nm under acidic conditions provided an enhanced CB7 association (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1:1&lt;/sub&gt; increases from 1.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), limiting spontaneous on-thread cucurbituril shuttling. This co-conformational change in the [2]pseudorotaxane is reversible in the dark with &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;=4.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Threading the flavylium moiety into CB7 leads to a dramatic increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, from 0.29 in the free axle to 0.97 in the [2]pseudorotaxane and 1.0 in the [3]pseudorotaxane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Amino&#8208;Acid Based Self&#8208;Assembled Biomaterials with Potent Antimicrobial Activity</title>

New self&#8208;assembled materials with prominent antimicrobial activity developed by the modification of amino acid's sidechain.







Abstract
The design and development of soft biomaterials based on amino acid and short&#8208;peptide have gained much attention due to their potent biomedical applications. A slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of single amino acid in a peptide or protein sequence has a huge impact on the structure and function. Phenylalanine is one of the most studied amino acids, which contains an aromatic phenyl group connected through a flexible &#8722;CH2&#8722; unit. In this work, we have examined whether flexibility and aromatic functionality of phenylalanine (Phe) are important in gel formation of model gelator Fmoc&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH or not. To examine this hypothesis, we synthesized Fmoc&#8208;derivatives of three analogues unnatural amino acids including cyclohexylalanine, phenylglycine, and homophenylalanine; which are slightly varied from Phe. Interestingly, all these three new analogues formed hydrogels in phosphate buffer at pH&#8197;7.0 having different gelation efficacy and kinetics. This study suggests that the presence of aromatic side&#8208;chain and flexibility are not mandatory for the gelation of this model gelator. Newly synthesized unnatural amino acid derivatives have also exhibited promising antimicrobial activity towards gram&#8208;positive bacteria by inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption. We further determined the biocompatibility of these amino acid derivatives by using a hemolysis assay on human blood cells. Overall studies described the development of single amino acid&#8208;based new injectable biomaterials with improved antimicrobial activity by the slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of amino acid.

         <title>A Study in Red: The Overlooked Role of Azo&#8208;Moieties in Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Strongly Extended Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What makes it red? A novel high&#8208;temperature treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow polymeric carbon nitride into a red carbon nitride is reported. Surprisingly, a detailed characterization reveals that the red colour comes from the azo&#8208;groups formed during the synthesis, a moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge and photocatalytic activity of carbon nitrides more into the visible range has been overlooked so far.







Abstract
The unique optical and photoredox properties of heptazine&#8208;based polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials make them promising semiconductors for driving various productive photocatalytic conversions. However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430&#8211;450&#8197;nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting. Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450&#8197;nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high&#8208;temperature (900&#8201;&#176;C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de&#8208;ammonification leads to the formation of azo&#8208;groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible&#8208;light (470&#8197;nm) for H2 evolution even without any additional co&#8208;catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge&#8208;trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Stiff&#8208;Stilbene: Proton&#8208;Gated Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitching and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization</title>

Push&#8208;pull stiff&#8208;stilbene, containing dimethylamino and cyano substituents, undergoes E&#8208;Z isomerization upon irradiation with visible light. The photochromic properties can be controlled by acid/base as an orthogonal secondary stimulus. Beside inhibiting the visible&#8208;light triggered isomerization process, acid addition significantly lowers the energy barrier to thermal back&#8208;isomerization.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor substituted stiff&#8208;stilbene is shown to undergo isomerization induced by visible light avoiding the need for harmful UV light. This visible&#8208;light photoswitching is inhibited by protonation of the dimethylamino&#8208;donor unit, disrupting the push&#8208;pull character and thus, gating of the photochromic properties is allowed by acid/base addition. Remarkably, the addition of a mild acid also triggers fast thermal back&#8208;isomerization, which is unprecedented for stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitches usually having a very high energy barrier for this process. These combined features offer unique orthogonal control over switching behavior by light and protonation, which is investigated in detail by 1H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. In addition, TD&#8208;DFT calculations are used to gain further insight into the absorption properties. Our results will help elevating the level of control over dynamic behavior in stiff&#8208;stilbene applications.

         <title>Switching the Mechanism of NADH Photooxidation by Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium polypyridine complex bearing a large planar ligand sphere is capable to preorganize naturally occurring nicotinamides via their adenine moiety. This allows the complex to achieve unexpectedly high catalytic activity in the selective photooxidation of these nicotinamides by following a direct electron transfer mechanism. Reference complexes not being equipped with a suitable ligand&#8208;based nicotinamide binding sphere oxidize these cofactors via 1O2 sensitation instead.







Abstract
A series of three Ru(II) polypyridine complexes was investigated for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+ in water. A combination of (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic studies and photocatalysis experiments revealed that ligand design can be used to control the mechanism of the photooxidation: For prototypical Ru(II) complexes a 1O2 pathway was found. Rudppz ([(tbbpy)2Ru(dppz)]Cl2, tbbpy=4,4'&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridine, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine), instead, initiated the cofactor oxidation by electron transfer from NAD(P)H enabled by supramolecular binding between substrate and catalyst. Expulsion of the photoproduct NAD(P)+ from the supramolecular binding site in Rudppz allowed very efficient turnover. Therefore, Rudppz permits repetitive selective assembly and oxidative conversion of reduced naturally occurring nicotinamides by recognizing the redox state of the cofactor under formation of H2O2 as additional product. This photocatalytic process can fuel discontinuous photobiocatalysis.

Therefore, &lt;b&gt;Rudppz&lt;/b&gt; permits repetitive selective assembly and oxidative conversion of reduced naturally occurring nicotinamides by recognizing the redox state of the cofactor under formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as additional product. This photocatalytic process can fuel discontinuous photobiocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Determination of Relative Stabilities of Metal&#8208;Peptide Bonds in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking bonds: Physiological environments are rich in potential ligands for metal&#8208;based drugs and understanding their molecular interactions with biomolecules is pivotal in the design and development of the next generation of metallodrugs. Energy&#8208;resolved mass spectrometry allows for measurement of relative bond stabilities in metal&#8208;peptide adducts in a quick and simple manner, providing data on the intrinsic properties of the adducts formed.







Abstract
Understanding binding site preferences in biological systems as well as affinities to binding partners is a crucial aspect in metallodrug development. We here present a mass spectrometry&#8208;based method to compare relative stabilities of metal&#8208;peptide adducts in the gas phase. Angiotensin 1 and substance P were used as model peptides. Incubation with isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of RuII, OsII, RhIII, and IrIII led to the formation of various adducts, which were subsequently studied by energy&#8208;resolved fragmentation experiments. The gas&#8208;phase stability of the metal&#8208;peptide bonds depended on the metal and the binding partner. Of the four complexes used, the OsII derivative bound strongest to Met, while RuII formed the most stable coordination bond with His. RhIII was identified as the weakest peptide binder and IrIII formed peptide adducts with intermediate stability. Probing these intrinsic gas&#8208;phase properties can help in the interpretation of biological activities and the design of site&#8208;specific protein binding metal complexes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Heck Carbonylation Reactions: Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Oxindole Ynones and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective domino Heck carbonylation reaction of o&#8208;iodoacrylanilides with phenylacetylenes or water has been developed using a Pd/(Cu) catalytic system containing a chiral diphosphine ligand L9, furnishing a wide array of chiral &#946;&#8208;carbonylated 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles in high yields with up to 99&#8201;% ee values.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective domino Heck carbonylation reaction of o&#8208;iodoacrylanilides with terminal alkynes and water as the nucleophiles, affording a diversity of &#946;&#8208;carbonylated 2&#8208;oxindole derivatives bearing a 3,3&#8208;disubstituted all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, in high yields (55&#8211;99&#8201;%) with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The synthetic utilities of the protocol were demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of 2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;derived ynone 3&#8201;ea and carboxylic acid 4&#8201;a, as well as the facile synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;oxindoles with a pyrazole or isoxazole moiety.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Formation of Cyano&#8208;Vinylene Linked Chains by Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the thermally induced synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted phenylene vinylene chains through Knoevenagel condensation reaction on an Au(111) surface. The formation of C=C interlinked chains is investigated by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory.







Abstract
The rapid development of on&#8208;surface synthesis provides a unique approach toward the formation of carbon&#8208;based nanostructures with designed properties. Herein, we present the on&#8208;surface formation of CN&#8208;substituted phenylene vinylene chains on the Au(111) surface, thermally induced by annealing the substrate stepwise at temperatures between 220&#8201;&#176;C and 240&#8201;&#176;C. The reaction is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory. Supported by the calculated reaction pathway, we assign the observed chain formation to a Knoevenagel condensation between an aldehyde and a methylene nitrile substituent.

         <title>Plasmon Coupling Enhanced Micro&#8208;Spectroscopy and Imaging for Sensitive Discrimination of Membrane Domains of a Single Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the additional plasmonic silver film for surface plasmon (SP) excitation to selectively enhance the fluorescence&#8208;Raman signal from the basal membrane in the near&#8208;field, plasmon coupling enhanced microscopic technique is capable of selectively exciting the basal and lateral cell membranes at the surface plasmon resonance (&#952;SP) and critical (&#952;C) angles, respectively. The brighter micro&#8208;images and more intense micro&#8208;spectra of the probes bound to basal and lateral cell membranes in SP and critical excitation modes than in conventional EPI mode allow the membrane domains to be clearly distinguished.







Abstract
Different cell membrane domains play different roles in many cell processes, and the discrimination of these domains is of considerable importance for the elucidation of cellular functions. However, the strategies available for distinguishing these cell membrane domains are limited. A novel technique called plasmon coupling enhanced micro&#8208;spectroscopy and imaging to discriminate basal and lateral membrane domains of a single cell combines the application of an additional plasmonic silver film for surface plasmon (SP) excitation to selectively excite and enhance the basal membranes in the near&#8208;field with directional enhanced microscopic imaging and spectroscopy. The SP and critical evanescent fields are induced upon excitation through a silver&#8208;coated semitransparent coverslip at the surface plasmon resonance and critical angles, respectively. The basal and lateral membrane domains located within the SP and critical evanescent fields can be selectively excited and distinguished by adjusting the incident angle of laser irradiation. Moreover, the brighter images and more intense spectra of membrane&#8208;targeting fluorescence&#8208;Raman probes under directional excitation than in conventional EPI mode allow clear identification of the membrane domains.

         <title>Breathing&#8208;Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key point of our work is selective adsorption of a C8 isomer with the assistance of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) breathing, which can be further applied to C8 isomer separation. When a C8 isomer mixture (colored balls) is applied to the MOF from an inlet bottle, the MOF starts to preferentially adsorb a single isomer (green balls) in the pores of MOF by breathing, as depicted by the expanding of the empty cages (MOFs) by incorporating the balls. As a result, the single C8 isomer is selectively isolated from the mixture, which is collected in the other bottle. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;C.&#8197;Rao, M.&#8197;Yoon et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102640).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A key point of our work&lt;/b&gt; is selective adsorption of a C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomer with the assistance of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) breathing, which can be further applied to C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomer separation. When a C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomer mixture (colored balls) is applied to the MOF from an inlet bottle, the MOF starts to preferentially adsorb a single isomer (green balls) in the pores of MOF by breathing, as depicted by the expanding of the empty cages (MOFs) by incorporating the balls. As a result, the single C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomer is selectively isolated from the mixture, which is collected in the other bottle.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Novel Catenane&#8208;like Interlocking: Metal&#8208;Determined Photoresponse and Uranyl Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organo&#8208;originated and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties were elucidated for a family of isostructural MOFs with tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate likers. Supramolecular entanglement between 2D networks dictates electron donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which not only allow photoluminescence through interligand charge&#8208;transfer excitation/emission but also cause photochromism through photoinduced electron transfer. Transition metal centers can weaken or prevent the photoresponsive properties because of energy transfer through d&#8208;d transitions. The MOFs also show highly sensitive and selective fluorescence quenching response to UO22+ in water.







Abstract
The assembly of two tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate ligands and different metal ions leads to seven isostructural MOFs, which show novel 2D&#8594;2D supramolecular entanglement featuring catenane&#8208;like interlocking of tricyclic cages. The MOFs show tripyridinium&#8208;afforded and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties. The MOFs with d10 metal centers (1&#8208;Cd, 1&#8208;Zn, 2&#8208;Cd, 2&#8208;Zn) show fast and reversible photochromism and concomitant fluorescence quenching, 1&#8208;Ni displays slower photochromism but does not fluoresce, and 1&#8208;Co and 2&#8208;Co are neither photochromic nor fluorescent. It is shown here that the network entanglement dictates donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which enable fluorescence originated from interligand charge transfer. The contacts also allow photoinduced electron transfer, which underlies photochromism and concomitant fluorescence response. The metal dependence in fluorescence and photochromism can be related to energy transfer through metal&#8208;centered d&#8208;d transitions. In addition, 1&#8208;Cd is demonstrated to be a potential fluorescence sensor for sensitive and selective detection of UO22+ in water.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochemiluminescence from Au18 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of Au18 nanoclusters revealed an extremely high quantum efficiency of 5.5 relative to that of Ru(bpy)32+, due to the exposed kernel facets, electrocatalytic loops and overlapped oxidation potentials of Au18 and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as co&#8208;reactant. ECL peak maxima at 832 and 850 nm were unambiguously identified as emissions from Au180*, Au181+* and Au182+* by means of spooling ECL and photoluminescence spectroscopy. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hesari and Z. Ding (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102926).

A tale of mirrors: Bioisosteres are molecules resulting from the exchange of atoms or moieties with a functionally similar alternative to create a new molecule with similar biological properties to the parent compound. They could be described as an &#8220;imperfect&#8221; reflection in the mirror and are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry. Though almost identical, their synthesis often implies very different routes and starting materials. In their Communication, F.&#8197;H. Lutter and M. Jouffroy describe a mild and functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant synthesis of (hetero)aryl alkynes from the corresponding carboxylic acids toward the synthesis of triazole bioisosters. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102130).

         <title>On the Reduction of MoO3&#160;to MoO2: A Path to Control the Particle Size and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the reduction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO  3  ) to metallic molybdenum, the first reduction step yielding molybdenum dioxide as an intermediary product is of crucial importance. In this study, we examined the impact of the parameters reduction temperature, water influx, and potassium content on the hydrogen reduction of this first reaction step. Beginning from the same starting material the chemical vapor transport mechanism was utilized to yield the phase pure MoO  2  . Analyses including powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and high performance optical microscopy were performed on the product phases. Modulations of the specific surface areas of molybdenum dioxide ranging from 2.28 to 0.41 m  2  /g were possible. Furthermore, a distinct shift from small plate&#8208;like grains to cuboid&#8208;like forms was achieved.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rh(I) NHC and Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, NHC =  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene = pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Py&#8208;Im), thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are presented. Selected catalysts were selectively immobilized inside the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15 having average pore diameters of 5.0 and 6.2 nm, respectively. Together with their homogenous progenitors, the immobilized catalysts were used in the hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes. For aromatic alkynes, both the neutral and cationic Rh(I) complexes showed excellent reactivity with exclusive formation of the &#946;(  E  )&#8208;isomer. For aliphatic alkynes, however, selectivity of the Rh(I) complexes was low. By contrast, the neutral and cationic Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes proved to be highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalysts, allowing for the formation of the thermodynamically less stable &#946;&#8208;(  Z  )&#8208;vinylsilane isomers at room temperature. Notably, the SBA&#8208;15 immobilized Rh(I) catalysts, in which the pore walls provide an additional confinement, showed excellent &#946;&#8208;(  Z  )&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of aliphatic alkynes, too. Also, in the case of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene, selective formation of the &#946;(  Z  )&#8208;isomer was observed with a neutral SBA&#8208;15 supported Rh(III) Cp* NHC complex but not with its homogenous counterpart. These are the first examples of high &#946;(  Z  )&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of alkynes by confinement generated upon immobilization inside mesoporous silica.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with a potential to streamline the drug discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The herein presented method enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed for the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug delivery conjugates, PROTACs, as well as probes for chemical biology. The rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid, and considerably accelerate, drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Methane Activation by (MoO3)5O&#8722; Cluster Anions: The Importance of Orbital Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the molybdenum oxide cluster anion (MoO 3 ) 5 O &#8722; , bearing an unpaired electron at a bridging oxygen atom (O b &#8226;&#8722; ), towards methane under thermal collision conditions has been studied by mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations. This reaction follows the mechanism of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and is facilitated by the O b &#8226;&#8722; radical center. The reactivity of (MoO 3 ) 5 O &#8722; can be traced back to the appropriate orientation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) that is essentially the 2p orbital of the O b &#8226;&#8722; atom. This study not only makes up the blank of thermal methane activation by the O b &#8226;&#8722; radical on negatively charged clusters but also yields new insights into methane activation by the atomic oxygen radical anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Activity of Supported Metal Nanoparticles and Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis has been known as one of the promising technologies due to its eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, the potential application of many photocatalysts is limited owing to their large bandgaps and inefficient use of the solar spectrum. One strategy to overcome this problem is to combine the advantages of heteroatom&#8208;containing supports with active metal centres to accurately adjust the structural parameters. Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) are excellent candidates due to their distinctive coordination environment which enhances photocatalytic activity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and carbon nitride (g&#8208;C  3  N  4  ) have shown great potential as catalyst support for SACs and MNPs. The numerous combinations of organic linkers with various heteroatoms and metal ions provide unique structural characteristics to achieve advanced materials. This review describes the recent advancement of the modified MOFs, COFs and g&#8208;C  3  N  4  with SACs and NPs for enhanced photocatalytic applications with emphasis on environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple regulation effects of ammonium acetate on ZnO growth process in chemical bath deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical bath deposition method has been used to synthesize a variety of ZnO morphology structures. However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO  3  )  2  &#8208;HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn  2+  &#8208;layered basic zinc salta(LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped, rod&#8208;shaped to a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand&#8208;ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn&#8208;rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve&#8208;renucleation&#8208;regrowth process which retains the twin&#8208;shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at ~10 mM ammonium acetate. Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) measurements show that the uniform hexagonal ZnO rods (Y&#8208;10, the sample named as Y&#8208;x (x represents x mM ammonium acetate, herein, x is 10 mM)) have a maximum photocurrent density of 1.54 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), much higher than that of the dumbbell&#8208;shaped ZnO rods (Y&#8208;50, 0.20 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) at the same voltage. These results provide a further explanation of morphology regulation mechanisms on ZnO synthesis processes and pave the road for more practical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Discovering new functional genes and developing high&#8208;performance materials are the goals being pursued by scientists. In this work, we successfully obtained a second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) material via the aqueous solution method, Y[N(CN)  2  ]  4  [NH(C  2  H  5  )  3  ]&#8729;3H  2  O, which is the first NLO material with anionic group N(CN)  2  &#8208;  . Remarkably, this material not only is strongly NLO&#8208;active at 1064 nm with a response of about 2.8 &#215; KH  2  PO  4  , but also possesses a short UV absorption edge of 250 nm. In&#8208;depth first&#8208;principles calculations well illustrate that the optical properties are mainly from the strong interaction of N, C and Y atoms. This result indicates that the N(CN)  2  &#8722;  anion may be a new NLO functional gene. This work enriches the diversity of NLO functional genes and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Molecular O2 on CoFe2O4&#160;(001) Surfaces: An Embedded Cluster Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dioxygen activation pathways on the (001) surfaces of cobalt ferrite, CoFe  2  O  4  , were investigated computationally using density functional theory and the hybrid Perdew&#8211;Burke&#8211;Ernzerhof exchange&#8208;correlation functional (PBE0) within the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. We considered two terminations: the A&#8208;layer exposing Fe  2+  and Co  2+  metal sites in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, and the B&#8208;layer exposing octahedrally coordinated Co  3+  . On the A&#8208;layer, molecular oxygen is chemisorbed as a superoxide on the Fe monocenter or bridging a Fe&#8208;Co cation pair, whereas on the B&#8208;layer it is adsorbed at the most stable anionic vacancy. Activation is promoted by transfer of electrons provided by the  d  metal centers onto the adsorbed oxygen. The subsequent dissociation of dioxygen into monoatomic species and surface reoxidation have been identified as the most critical steps that may limit the rate of the oxidation processes. Of the reactive metal&#8208;O species, [Fe  III  &#8208;O]  2+  is thermodynamically most stable, while the oxygen of the Co&#8208;O species may easily migrate across the A&#8208;layer with barriers smaller than the associative desorption.</dc:description>

         <title>The Electrochemical cis&#8208;Chlorination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double role: The cis&#8208;chlorination of alkenes is realised in an electrochemical setup with PhSeCl as catalyst. The supporting electrolyte (TBACl) acts as nucleophilic reagent for the SN2&#8208;type replacement of selenium versus chloride in the key step of the process while the PhSeCl&#8208;alkene adduct is activated by electrochemically generated PhSeCl3.







Abstract
The first example for the electrochemical cis&#8208;dichlorination of alkenes is presented. The reaction can be performed with little experimental effort by using phenylselenyl chloride as catalyst and tetrabutylammoniumchloride as supporting electrolyte, which also acts as nucleophilic reagent for the SN2&#8208;type replacement of selenium versus chloride. Cyclic voltammetric measurements and control experiments revealed a dual role of phenylselenyl chloride in the reaction. Based on these results a reaction mechanism was postulated, where the key step of the process is the activation of a phenylselenyl chloride&#8208;alkene adduct by electrochemically generated phenylselenyl trichloride. Like this, different aliphatic and aromatic cyclic and acyclic alkenes were converted to the dichlorinated products. Thereby, throughout high diastereoselectivities were achieved for the cis&#8208;chlorinated compounds of &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 or higher.

         <title>In Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging&#160;of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum mechanical framework&#160;that enables a combination of ideas from&#160;three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA), Quantum Chemical Topology, and Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one&#8208;part electrons and one&#8208;part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. Formation of polar bonds are predicted to cause inversions of electronegativity and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8208;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. Electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of&#160;pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived Self&#8208;Supported Carbon&#8208;Based Composites for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. A self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. In this review, we intend to offer a timely and comprehensive summary of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials for electrocatalytic water splitting, and a deep analysis and understanding of the relationship between the component manipulation and the properties of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials is also showed.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for the sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon&#8208;based composites, including heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for the sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon-based composites, including heteroatom-doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance. In comparison, a self-supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Recently, self-supported metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by coordination of metal centers and organic ligands have been considered as suitable templates/precursors to construct free-standing carbon-based composites grown on conductive substrate. MOFs-derived carbon-based composites have various merits, such as the well-aligned array architecture and evenly distributed active sites, and easy functionalization with other species, which make them suitable alternatives to non-noble metal-included electrocatalysts. In this review, we intend to show the research progresses by employment of MOFs as precursors to prepare self-supported carbon-based composites. Focusing on these MOFs-derived carbon-based nanomaterials, the latest advances in their controllable synthesis, composition regulation, electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS) are presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are showed for the further developments of MOFs-derived self-supported carbon-based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8208;Modified DNA Three&#8208;Way Junctions with Amide linkers: Metal&#8208;Dependent Structure Induction and Self&#8208;Sorting</title>

         <dc:description>
Nitrogen+nickel nexus: A bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structure has been synthesized from three DNA strands modified with a bipyridine (bpy) ligand via a stable amide linker. The bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was thermally stabilized by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex. Structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was achieved by addition or removal of NiII ions. Furthermore, NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was demonstrated by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts.







Abstract
DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structures are essential building blocks for the construction of DNA nanoarchitectures. We have synthesized a bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;modified DNA 3WJ by using a newly designed bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside, Ubpy&#8208;3, in which a bpy ligand is tethered via a stable amide linker. The thermal stability of the bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was greatly enhanced by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex at the junction core (&#916;Tm=+17.7&#8201;&#176;C). Although the stereochemistry of the modification site differs from that of the previously reported bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside Ubpy&#8208;2, the degree of the NiII&#8208;mediated stabilization observed with Ubpy&#8208;3 was comparable to that of Ubpy&#8208;2. Structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was carried out by the addition or removal of NiII ions. Furthermore, NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was performed by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. Both transformations were driven by the formation of NiII(bpy)3 complexes. The structural induction and self&#8208;sorting of bpy&#8208;modified 3WJs are expected to have many potential applications in the development of metal&#8208;responsive DNA materials.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208; and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Substitution Reactions of Propargylic Alcohol Derivatives with Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching between paths: Ruthenium&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohol derivatives have been achieved by using N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones as ambident nucleophiles, whose nucleophilicity is switched between carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered ones by two different catalytic systems, affording propargylic alkylated products and propargylic aminated products, respectively.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohol derivatives with N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones as ambident nucleophiles are achieved in which N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones exhibit impressive different reactivities depending on different catalytic systems, behaving as carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles to give the corresponding propargylic alkylated products in ruthenium catalysis, or as nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles to afford the corresponding propargylic aminated products in copper catalysis. DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the detailed reaction pathways of these two systems. Further transformation of propargylic substituted products affords the corresponding multisubstituted pyrazoles as cyclization products in good to high yields.

         <title>From the {FeIII2Ln2} Butterfly's Perspective: the Magnetic Benefits and Challenges of Cooperativity within 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f Based Coordination Clusters</title>

The well&#8208;known oxo&#8208;centred Fe triangle is used to access the vast majority of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OR)2L2(O2CR)6] butterflies, since it provides a di&#8208;iron central body unit and carboxylate bridges to the wingtips, which are occupied by supplied Ln ions. The remaining coordination sites of the lanthanide are occupied by a multidentate ligand, which can also provide further bridging. This system provides a useful testbed for exploring multiple variations, for example changing the Ln, the bridging carboxylate and the nature of the chelating ligand.







Abstract
In this Review we discuss the tuning handles which can be used to steer the magnetic properties of FeIII&#8208;4&#8201;f &#8220;butterfly&#8221; compounds. The majority of presented compounds were produced in the context of project A3 &#8220;Di&#8208; to tetranuclear compounds incorporating highly anisotropic paramagnetic metal ions&#8221; within the SFB/TRR88 &#8220;3MET&#8221;. These contain {FeIII2Ln2} cores encapsulated in ligand shells which are easy to tune in a &#8220;test&#8208;bed&#8221; system. We identify the following advantages and variables in such systems: (i) the complexes are structurally simple usually with one crystallographically independent FeIII and LnIII, respectively. This simplifies theory and anaylsis; (ii) choosing Fe allows 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to be used as an additional technique which can give information about oxidation levels and spin states, local moments at the iron nuclei and spin&#8208;relaxation and, more importantly, about the anisotropy not only of the studied isotope, but also of elements interacting with this isotope; (iii) isostructural analogues with all the available (i.&#8201;e. not Pm) 4&#8201;f ions can be synthesised, enabling a systematic survey of the influence of the 4&#8201;f ion on the electronic structure; (iv) this cluster type is obtained by reacting [FeIII3O(O2CR)6(L)3](X) (X=anion, L=solvent such as H2O, py) with an ethanolamine&#8208;based ligand L&#8242; and lanthanide salts. This allows to study analogues of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(L&#8242;)2(O2CR)6] using the appropriate iron trinuclear starting materials. (v) the organic main ligand can be readily functionalised, facilitating a systematic investigation of the effect of organic substituents on the ligands on the magnetic properties of the complexes. We describe and discuss 34 {MIII2Ln2} (M=Fe or in one case Al) butterfly compounds which have been reported up to 2020. The analysis of these gives perspectives for designing new SMM systems with specific electronic and magnetic signatures

         <title>gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Substituted Fluoroalkenes as Mimics of Amide Derivatives or Phosphates: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the unique properties of the fluoroalkene moiety &#8208; mimic of amide bond, high strength of C&#8722;F bond &#8208; several gem&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as relevant and stable mimics of important moieties, such as phosphate, urea, carbamate and S&#8208;thiocarbamate. The gem&#8208;heteroatom substituted fluoroalkene scaffold could also be the starting point toward more complex molecules. Herein, the synthetic access to these fluoroalkenes derivatives over the last decade is described.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes have received little attention despite their great potential in medicinal chemistry or in fine chemistry. Indeed, due to the electronic and steric similarity between the fluoroalkene moiety and the amide bond as well as the high strength of the carbon&#8208;fluorine bond, these gem&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as stable mimics of various important organic functions, such as phosphates, carbamates, S&#8208;thiocarbamates and ureas. We present herein an overview describing the syntheses over the last decade of heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes in geminal position. This review will be divided into several sections covering each the common following heteroatom: oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, phosphorus&#8208;, boron&#8208; and silicon&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes.

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size Instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm Switch! Chemical bonds in general become stronger as the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. This correlation has hitherto been considered causal but, here, we show it is not in some remarkable cases. For example, carbon&#8722;halogen bonds become weaker from C&#8722;F to C&#8722;I, despite stronger (not weaker) orbital interactions as the bond overlap increases, because of stronger Pauli repulsion with the larger, more electron&#8208;rich halogen.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically analyzed element&#8722;element bonds of archetypal HnX&#8722;YHn molecules (X, Y=C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I), using density functional theory. One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e.&#8201;g., from C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C&#8722;F to C&#8722;I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electronegativity difference. Instead, we show that the effective atom size (via steric Pauli repulsion) is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance. We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance.

         <title>Indandione&#8208;Terminated Quinoidal Compounds for Low&#8208;Bandgap Small Molecules with Strong Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption: Effect of Conjugation Length on the Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap quinoidal molecule with intense absorption in the first (760&#8211;1000&#8197;nm) and second (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) near&#8208;infrared region was developed by synergistical extending quinoidal core and end groups.







Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors have attracted much attention for their multiple applications in optoelectronics. However, the realization of narrow bandgap is challenging particularly for small molecules. Herein, we have synthesized four quinoidal compounds, i.&#8201;e., QSN3, QSN4, QSN5 and QSN6, with electron rich S,N&#8208;heteroacene as the quinoidal core and indandione as the end&#8208;groups. The optical bandgap of the quinoidal compounds is systematically decreased with the extension of quinoidal skeleton, while maintaining stable closed&#8208;shell ground state. QSN6 absorbs an intense absorption in the first and second near&#8208;infrared region in the solid state, and has extremely low optical bandgap of 0.74&#8197;eV. Cyclic voltammetry analyses reveal that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four quinoidal compounds all lie below &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, resulting in good electron&#8208;transporting characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. These results demonstrated that the combination of &#960;&#8208;extended quinoidal core and end&#8208;groups in quinoidal compounds is an effective strategy for the synthesis of low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with good stability.

         <title>Tunable Synchronicity of Molecular Valence Tautomerism with Macroscopic Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition by Molecular Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synchronicity of molecular valence tautomerism (VT) and macroscopic solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition has been rationally tuned by crystal lattice engineering in a new series of bistable valence tautomeric cobalt complexes [Co(3,6&#8208;DTBQ)2(L)2] (3,6&#8208;DTBQ&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsemiquinonato/catecholato) with two ancillary pyridine ligands (L) substituted with di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexa(ethylene glycol) groups.







Abstract
The combination of a cobalt&#8208;dioxolene core that exhibits valence tautomerism (VT) with pyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid functionalized with chains bearing two, four, or six oxyethylene units led to new complexes ConEGEspy (n&#8201;=&#8201;2, 4, and 6). These complexes commonly form violet crystals of the low&#8208;spin (ls)&#8208;[CoIII(nEGEspy)2(3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)(3,6&#8208;DTBCat)] (ls&#8208;[CoIII], 3,6&#8208;DTBSQ&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl semiquinonato, 3,6&#8208;DTBCat&#8201;=&#8201;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl catecholato). Interestingly, violet crystals of Co2EGEspy in the ls&#8208;[CoIII] transitioned into a green liquid, accompanied by an almost complete VT shift (94&#8201;%) to the high&#8208;spin (hs)&#8208;[CoII(nEGEspy)2(3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)2] (hs&#8208;[CoII]) upon melting. In contrast, violet crystals of Co4EGEspy and Co6EGEspy in the ls&#8208;[CoIII] exhibited partial VT (33&#8201;%) and only a 9.3&#8201;% VT shift after melting, respectively. These data demonstrate the tunability of the synchronicity of the molecular VT and macroscopic solid&#8208;liquid transitions by optimizing the tethered chains, thus establishing a new strategy for coupling bistable molecules with the macroscopic world.

         <title>Development of Red&#8208;Shifted and Fluorogenic Nucleoside and Oligonucleotide Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleoside based diarylethenes was modified, with the aim of bathochromically shifting the absorption wavelength in the visible range (&#955;max,vis) and to introduce photomodulatable fluorescence. Extending the &#960;&#8208;system of the bridging unit resulted in a desired red shift of &#955;max,vis and fluorogenicity could be obtained by the introduction of a fluorescent adenosine analogue.







Abstract
The reversible modulation of fluorescence signals by light is of high interest for applications in super&#8208;resolution microscopy, especially on the DNA level. In this article we describe the systematic variation of the core structure in nucleoside&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs), in order to generate intrinsically fluorescent photochromes. The introduction of aromatic bridging units resulted in a bathochromic shift of the visible absorption maximum of the closed&#8208;ring form, but caused reduced thermal stability and switching efficiency. The replacement of the thiophene aryl unit by thiazol improved the thermal stability, whereas the introduction of a benzothiophene unit led to inherent and modulatable turn&#8208;off fluorescence. This feature was further optimized by introducing a fluorescent indole nucleobase into the DAE core, resulting in an effective photoswitch with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.0166 and a fluorescence turn&#8208;off factor of 3.2. The site&#8208;specific incorporation into an oligonucleotide resulted in fluorescence&#8208;switchable DNA with high cyclization quantum yields and switching efficiency, which may facilitate future applications.

         <title>Synthesis, Mechanism Elucidation and Biological Insights of Tellurium(IV)&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>

In the search for bioactive organotellurium compounds, promising hypervalent TeIV&#8208;containing heterocycles with possible biological applications have been obtained. 125Te NMR of a series of 16 halogenated organotelluranes confirms that these products contain a Te&#8722;O bond within the five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring. We describe their synthesis, identification of the most favorable mechanism and diastereoselectivity, stability assays and in&#8197;vitro potential against L.&#8197;amazonensis.







Abstract
Inspired by the synthetic and biological potential of organotellurium substances, a series of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring organotelluranes containing a Te&#8722;O bond were synthesized and characterized. Theoretical calculations elucidated the mechanism for the oxidation&#8208;cyclization processes involved in the formation of the heterocycles, consistent with chlorine transfer to hydroxy telluride, followed by a cyclization step with simultaneous formation of the new Te&#8722;O bond and deprotonation of the OH group. Moreover, theoretical calculations also indicated anti&#8208;diastereoisomers to be major products for two chirality center&#8211;containing compounds. Antileishmanial assays against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes disclosed 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurane LQ50 (IC50=4.1&#177;1.0; SI=12), 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurolane LQ04 (IC50=7.0&#177;1.3; SI=7) and 1,2&#955;4&#8208;benzoxatellurole LQ56 (IC50=5.7&#177;0.3; SI=6) as more powerful and more selective compounds than the reference, being up to four times more active. A stability study supported by 125Te NMR analyses showed that these heterocycles do not suffer structural modifications in aqueous&#8208;organic media or at temperatures up to 65&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Ultrahigh Rate Capability and Lifespan MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF Electrode for High Performance Battery&#8208;Type Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14478-14488, October 19, 2021. </description>

Nanoflower structural MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite prepared by in&#8197;situ growth of Ni&#8208;MOF on the surface of MnCo2O4 nanorods derived from Co/Mn&#8208;MOF at 600&#8201;&#176;C has a high cycling stability and outstanding rate performance as supercapacitor electrode material.







Abstract
MnCo2O4 is derived from a Co/Mn bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). Then Ni&#8208;MOF is directly grown on the surface of the obtained MnCo2O4 to form a nano&#8208;flower structure with small balls. A large surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo2O4 and porosity of Ni&#8208;MOF allow the prepared MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite material to deliver an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, an appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo2O4 precursor is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo2O4 and electrochemical performances of the resulted composite material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo2O4&#8208;600/Ni&#8208;MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance (when the current density increases from 1 to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41&#8201;%) and good cycle stability (the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74&#8201;% after 20&#8201;000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF has a good application prospect in the market.

Singlet&#8208;triplet gap energies are computed for simple pnictinidene moieties to offer theoretical insights and motivate future work on heavier pnictogen containing species.







Abstract
Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST=ESinglet&#8722;ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8722;R; Pn=P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8722;PH2 (&#8722;3.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and P&#8722;NH2 (&#8722;0.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8722;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.

Cyclic d/l peptide nanotubes (CPNs) have diverse applications in biological and materials science. We study the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CPN stability and report crystal structures of non&#8208;tubular folded peptide conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations correlate with measured H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives, showing how the composition and relative orientation of amino acids are key factors in CPN stability.







Abstract
Our understanding of the factors affecting the stability of cyclic d/l peptide (CP) nanotubes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CP nanotube stability through X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterise the distinct CP&#8208;CP alignments that can form and identify stable and unstable dimers by MD simulation. We measure H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives of synthesised CPs by 1H&#8722;D exchange experiments and find good correlation with predicted CP&#8208;CP stabilities. We find that hydrophobic amino acids improve CP dimer stability but experimentally reduce solubility. Charged amino acids either increase or decrease CP dimer stability depending on the relative orientation and composition of charged groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are solved for two CPs, revealing non&#8208;tubular folded conformations. Ultimately, this work will assist the educated design of stable tubular structures for potential applications in biomedicine.

         <title>Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids</title>

Spatial distance has a major impact on the photoswitching in NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids. By careful molecular design and using MD simulations it was possible to gain valuable insight into the mechanism underlying these unique photoswitches.







Abstract
With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back&#8208;reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C60. In this work, the fundamental processes within these hybrids has been investigated. Variation of the linker unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction, two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8211; fullerene hybrids having a long&#8208;rigid and a short&#8208;rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC&#8211;C60 distance of up to 14.2&#8197;&#197;. By comparing the NBD&#8211;QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back&#8208;reaction.

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14472-14477, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous PdNi/Ni nanoparticles assembled nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) have been synthesized via replacement reaction, in which nickel nanowires serve as sacrificial template to form tubular structure and the diblock copolymer induce the formation of mesoporous structures. Due to the mesoporous nanoparticle structure and tubular geometry, the mPdNi/Ni NTs have better catalytic performance than mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black for ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibite superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Strapped Porphyrin BODIPY Rotaxanes for Dual Optical and Electrochemical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14550-14559, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes have been prepared according to an active metal template strategy. Capitalising on the augmented anion affinities by virtue of axle triazole ligation to macrocyclic zinc(II) metalloporphyrin, the incorporation of fluorogenic BODIPY and redox&#8208;active porphyrin transducing groups allows dual&#8208;channel sensing of anions by quenching BODIPY emission and through cathodic perturbations of porphyrin oxidation redox couples.







Abstract
Anion receptors employing two distinct sensory mechanisms are rare. Herein, we report the first examples of halogen&#8208;bonding porphyrin BODIPY [2]rotaxanes capable of both fluorescent and redox electrochemical sensing of anions. 1H NMR, UV/visible and electrochemical studies revealed rotaxane axle triazole group coordination to the zinc(II) metalloporphyrin&#8208;containing macrocycle component, serves to preorganise the rotaxane binding cavity and dramatically enhances anion binding affinities. Mechanically bonded, integrated&#8208;axle BODIPY and macrocycle strapped metalloporphyrin motifs enable the anion recognition event to be sensed by the significant quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore and cathodic perturbations of the metalloporphyrin P/P+. redox couple.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled, Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>

Motion capture: Gel beads that incorporate a self&#8208;assembled low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) into an agarose polymer gel particle are reported; when loaded with ethanol and placed in water, they self&#8208;propel as a result of the Marangoni effect. The presence of the LMWG significantly increases their mobility and endows them with unique functions, such as enhanced ability to adsorb a pollutant dye.







Abstract
Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate an enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water owing to the Marangoni effect changes in surface tension caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move farther and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8220;stamp&#8221; &#8211; circles moved the furthest, whereas stars showed more rotation on their own axes. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of noncovalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery suggests that adding them to self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.

Arylmethylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains: Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains have been developed to systemically investigate the impact of arylmethylene substitution and its number on molecular structure, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Better light&#8208;harvesting properties and molecular planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMO levels are achieved, enabling improvements in device efficiency both for halogenated and non&#8208;halogenated processing solvents.







Abstract
Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) were developed that feature methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains, to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA without conjugated side chains. The synthesized SMAs were tested in polymer solar cells for examples of their applicability. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.

Hold tight, shine bright: A novel method for the development of lanthanide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, taking advantage of an EuIII complex with an organic ligand covalently bound to the silica nanoparticle supports at two binding sites has been demonstrated. The hybrid nanoluminophore exhibited higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previous EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials.







Abstract
In this study, we have demonstrated a two&#8208;legged, upright molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent LnIII&#8208;silica nanomaterials. A novel EuIII&#8208;silica hybrid nanoparticle was developed by using a doubly binding TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 (TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) linker. The TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 was confirmed by 1H, 31P, 29Si NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Luminescent Eu(hfa)3 and Eu(tfc)3 moieties (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3&#8208;(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed onto TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3&#8208;modified silica nanoparticles, producing Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2 and Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2, respectively. Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 exhibited the higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 showed an extra&#8208;large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54&#8201;%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3)2 was found to be 39&#8201;%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 linker is a promising candidate for development of EuIII&#8208;based luminescent materials.

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C&#8201;N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14410-14417, October 19, 2021. </description>

Gold(III) metallacycles. Monocyclometalated gold(III) metallacycles with tunable emission properties have been demonstrated. The complexes show highly emissive triplet excited states (T1) with long excited state lifetimes. The T1 of the complexes and the triplet excited state of dioxygen (3O2) lie in a delicate balance resulting in an efficient quenching of these triplet states to generate 1O2. The first use case of monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes to generate 1O2 photochemically is demonstrated.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and photoluminescent properties of four cyclometalated (C&#8201;N)&#8208;type gold(III) complexes bearing a bidentate diacetylide ligand, tolan&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diacetylide (tda), are reported. The complexes exhibit highly tunable excited state properties and show photoluminescence (PL) across the entire visible spectrum from sky&#8208;blue (&#955;PL=493&#8197;nm) to red (&#955;PL=675&#8197;nm) with absolute PL quantum yields (PLQY) of up to 75&#8201;% in solution, the highest PLQY found for any monocyclometalated Au(III) complex in solution. As a consequence of the use of the strongly rigidifying diacetylide bidentate ligand, a significant increase in the excited state lifetimes (&#964;0=16&#8211;258 &#956;s) was found in solution and in thin films. The complexes showed remarkable singlet oxygen generation in aerated solution with absolute singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#981;1&#916;) values reaching up to 7.5&#215;10&#8722;5 and singlet oxygen lifetimes (&#964;01&#916;) in the range of 66&#8211;95 &#956;s. Furthermore, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates of singlet oxygen were determined using the &#981;1&#916; and &#964;01&#916; values and correlations are drawn between the formation of singlet oxygen and its interaction with cyclometalated (C&#8201;N) gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14418-14426, October 19, 2021. </description>

Promoting renewable energy production: LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts have been prepared by a sol&#8208;gel protocol. Subsequent calcination at 700&#8201;&#176;C yields a macroporous material with modest surface area. Hydrogen reduction induces surface defects, in particular a high concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits a significantly higher current density at lower overpotential, with faster kinetics and superior stability for oxygen evolution for water splitting.







Abstract
Perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high efficiency and durability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influence their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700&#8201;&#176;C calcined LaNiO3 induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO3; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of 380&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ valence states, which quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Further, it reveals that the formation of oxygen vacancies is thermodynamically more favourable on the surface than in the bulk; it increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO3 in accordance with the enhanced OER activity that is observed.

Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700&#8201;&#176;C calcined LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of 380&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a small Tafel slope of 70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; valence states, which quantum-chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Further, it reveals that the formation of oxygen vacancies is thermodynamically more favourable on the surface than in the bulk; it increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in accordance with the enhanced OER activity that is observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Modulation on NiCo2S4Nanoarray by N Doping to Enhance 2e&#8208;ORR Selectivity for Photothermal AOPs and Zn&#8722;O2Batteries**
</title>

Zn&#8722;O2 batteries: A 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;active electrocatalyst was synthesized by loading N&#8208;doped NiCo2S4 nanoarray on filter paper derived carbon paper with two coordination complexes as precursors. The electrocatalyst also exhibits good photothermal properties. Under the heating of the photothermal effect, H2O2 produced by 2e&#8208;ORR is decomposed and releases .OH radicals, which can degrade antibiotics, pesticides, and phenol through advanced oxidation processes. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and Zn as anode, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery was constructed.







Abstract
As a H2O2 generator, a 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in the advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo2S4 towards the 2e&#8722; reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S2&#8722;. The result implies that this weakens the interaction between NiCo2S4 and OOH*, suppresses O&#8722;O bond breaking and enhances H2O2 selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H2O2 produced by the oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and releaseOH, which degrades organic pollutants through the advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over the traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe2+ free character. With Zn as anode and the electrocatalyst as cathode material, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery is assembled. It achieves electricity generation and photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process simultaneously.

         <title>Target&#8208;Dependent Protection of DNA Aptamers against Nucleolytic Digestion Enables Signal&#8208;On Biosensing with Toehold&#8208;Mediated Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14543-14549, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digestion protection: a fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase followed by toehold mediated strand displacement of the target by a circular template to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing sub&#8208;nanomolar detection limits for protein targets, including in serum and plasma.







Abstract
We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5&#8242;&#8208;end protects it from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn&#8208;on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real&#8208;time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay.

         <title>Engineering Functional Interface with Built&#8208;in Catalytic and Self&#8208;Oxidation Sites for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

More than a separator: An integrated functional interface on separator of lithium&#8722;sulfur battery is fabricated with graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowires (G@MC). The G@MC possesses &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; catalytic Mn2+ sites and good electronic conductivity, which endows the batteries with fast kinetic conversion of polysulfides and rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. The reversible and strong chemical interaction between intermediates and G@MC is beneficial for achieving enhanced cycling stability and rate capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have attracted great attention due to their high theoretical energy density. The rapid redox conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is effective for solving the serious shuttle effect and improving the utilization of active materials. The functional design of the separator interface with fast charge transfer and active catalytic sites is desirable for accelerating the conversion of intermediates. Herein, a graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowire (G@MC) was prepared and utilized to engineer the separator interface. G@MC with active Mn2+ sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn&#8722;S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+ sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS via the spontaneous &#8220;self&#8208;redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC&#8208;based battery exhibits only 0.038&#8201;% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0&#8197;C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Are Heavy Pnictogen&#8208;&#960; Interactions Really &#8220;&#960; Interactions&#8221;?</title>

Is it, or is it not &#960;? The interaction of heavy pnictogen compounds with benzene and cyclohexane provides an insightful example of whether such interactions are indeed &#8220;&#960; interactions&#8221;. High&#8208;level, ab&#8208;initio calculations show that in both cases the interaction is dominated by dispersion and that this contribution is practically the same with or without a &#960; system.







Abstract
The noncovalent interactions of heavy pnictogens with &#960;&#8208;arenes play a fundamental role in fields like crystal engineering or catalysis. The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of &#960;&#8208;arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat&#8208;twist conformers, and thus suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilise the desired conformation.

         <title>Deuterated Indocyanine Green (ICG) with Extended Aqueous Storage Shelf&#8208;Life: Chemical and Clinical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14535-14542, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuterium atom in the right place mitigates the 60&#8208;year problem of aqueous Indocyanine Green (ICG) instability. A clinical stock solution of heavy ICG in water can be stored for an extended period without significant loss of fluorescence brightness; this will improve the effectiveness of various biomedical imaging, diagnostic and therapy procedures.







Abstract
Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dye that is used extensively for various imaging and diagnostic procedures. One drawback with ICG is its instability in water, which means that reconstituted clinical doses have to be used very shortly after preparation. Two deuterated versions of ICG were prepared with deuterium atoms on the heptamethine chain, and the spectral, physiochemical, and photostability properties were quantified. A notable mechanistic finding is that self&#8208;aggregation of ICG in water strongly favors dye degradation by a photochemical oxidative dimerization reaction that gives a nonfluorescent product. Storage stability studies showed that replacement of C&#8722;H with C&#8722;D decreased the dimerization rate constant by a factor of 3.1, and it is likely that many medical and preclinical procedures will benefit from the longer shelf&#8208;lives of these two deuterated ICG dyes. The discovery that ICG self&#8208;aggregation promotes photoinduced electron transfer can be exploited as a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation photodynamic therapies.

         <title>Frontispiece: Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surfaces are ubiquitous in nanomaterials at large. Colloidal nanocrystals provide a versatile platform to conveniently study in the solution phase the impact of surface chemistry on the electronic structure of nanomaterials. On page 14359, the impact of the post&#8208;synthesis surface chemistry modification on the light absorption properties of colloidal quantum dots is discussed. A unified description of the contribution of the surface species to the ground state electronic structure of the overall, ligand&#8208;coordinated quantum dot is attempted.

         <title>Frontispiece: Noncovalent Interactions at Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tuneable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts do not effectively catalyze organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts. For more information, see the Minireview by K. T. Mahmudov et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;14370.

Explaining the oxidation&#8211;cyclization mechanism of heterocycles containing Te&#8722;O bonds. The structures of halogenated Te&#8208;containing heterocycles have been elucidated, and computational methods showed them to be prepared in a two&#8208;step oxidation&#8211;cyclization. The three compounds shown represent both the structural diversity and the biological application of these hypervalent compounds as leishmanicides.

A new class of monocyclometalated gold(III) diacetylide metallacycles has been synthesized and characterized. Photophysical investigations of these complexes revealed strong phosphorescence with very long excited&#8208;state lifetimes. We demonstrate the efficient singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation properties of these metallacycles through their ability to sensitize singlet oxygen. The complexes&#8242; varying ability to generate singlet oxygen opens avenues for their potential use in catalysis and biomedical applications.

The impact of defect generation by thermal reduction on the structure and electrocatalytic performance of LaNiO3 has been examined in a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Surface defects, predominantly surface oxygen vacancies, promote oxygen evolution over LaNiO3 resulting in a significantly lower overpotential (380&#8197;mV) for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faster kinetics (70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope) and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes to conventionally prepared LaNiO3. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Arandiyan, Y. Wang, T. Maschmeyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102672).

A two&#8208;legged, standing&#8208;up molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent EuIII&#8211;silica nanomaterials is demonstrated. By using a Eu(hfa)3 complex with TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)3 (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) covalently bonded to the silica nanoparticles at two binding sites, nanoluminophores Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8208;Si)2&#8211;SiO2 were developed that have an excellent intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93%) and long emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms).

         <title>Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14359-14369, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligands at the surface of colloidal quantum dots are intrinsically electronically coupled to the inorganic semiconductor core thus affecting the overall ground state electronic structure and, consequently, the light absorption properties.







Abstract
At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211; and wires and wells, too &#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other's electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.&#8201;e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions at Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14370-14389, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8211;&#960; and pancake interactions in the design of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes is discussed.







Abstract
Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tunable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts (solvento complexes) do not catalyze effectively organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts in both homogenous and heterogenous catalysis. In this minireview, we discuss several relevant examples, based on X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, in which the hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds, as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8211;&#960; and pancake interactions, are used as a synthon in the decoration of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Germanylidene Anions: Efficient Single&#8208;Site Nucleophiles for Activation of Small Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
Stepwise reduction of germylenes via stable and isolable germanium radicals yields germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands. The anions contain a highly electron&#8208;rich germanium centre with significant ylidone character and are efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles that react even with weak electrophiles.







Abstract
Rare mononuclear and helical chain low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene and hypermetallyl ligands were synthesised by stepwise reduction from corresponding germylene precursors via stable and isolable germanium radicals. The electronic structures of the anions can be described with ylidene and ylidone resonance forms with the Ge&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;electrons capable of binding even weak electrophiles. The germanylidene anions reacted with CO2 to give &#956;&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O complexes, a rare coordination mode for low&#8208;valent germanium and inaccessible for the related neutral germylones. These results implicate low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions as efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles for activation of small molecules.

A rare phenomenon: A pronounced shift to lower frequency in the IR spectra of isostructural ThIV and UIV complexes of isocyanide and carbonyl indicates strong backbonding between the actinide and ligand. Quantum mechanical calculations show that charge transfer from an An&#8722;As &#963;&#8208;bond to the &#960;* orbital of the ligand is responsible for the strong donor&#8208;acceptor interaction.







Abstract
The coordination of tBuNC and CO with the diarsenido complexes (C5Me5)2An(&#951;2&#8208;As2Mes2), An=Th, U, has been investigated. For the first time, a comparison between isostructural complexes of ThIV and UIV has been possible with CO; density functional calculations indicated an appreciable amount of &#960; backbonding that originates from charge transfer from an actinide&#8208;arsenic sigma bond. The calculated CO stretching frequencies in the ThIV and UIV diarsenido complexes are consistent with the experimental measurements, both show large shifts to lower frequency. We demonstrate that the &#960; backbonding is crucial to explaining the red shifts of CO frequency upon AnIV complex formation. Interestingly, this interaction essentially correlates to the parallel orientation of &#960;*(C&#8722;O) orbitals relative to the An&#8722;As bond.

         <title>Selective One&#8208;Pot Syntheses of Mixed Silicon&#8208;Germanium Heteroadamantane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14401-14404, October 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward novel nanoclusters: The fourfold SiCl3&#8208;substituted Si4Ge6 ([0]), Si5Ge5 ([1]), and Si6Ge4 ([2]) heteroadamantane cores are accessible directly from Me2GeCl2 and Si2Cl6/Cl&#8722; in a time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient synthesis. In a chloride ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement, [2] is converted into [1] at room temperature and into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
SixGey alloys are emerging materials for modern semiconductor technology. Well&#8208;defined model systems of the bulk structures aid in understanding their intrinsic characteristics. Three such model clusters have now been realized in the form of the SixGey heteroadamantanes [0], [1], and [2] through selective one&#8208;pot syntheses starting from Me2GeCl2, Si2Cl6, and [nBu4N]Cl. Compound [0] contains six GeMe2 and four SiSiCl3 vertices, whereas one and two of the GeMe2 groups are replaced by SiCl2 moieties in compounds [1] and [2], respectively. Chloride&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement quantitatively converts [2] into [1] at room temperature and finally into [0] at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is not only remarkable in view of the rigidity of these cage structures but also sheds light on the assembly mechanism.

         <title>A Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 58, Page 14390-14395, October 19, 2021. </description>

A novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300&#8197;nm) and suitable band structure was successfully synthesized, and it functioned as an efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalytst for photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines under the irradiation of white (400&#8211;830&#8197;nm), and red light (660&#8211;680&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Imines are important intermediates in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imines and has attracted great attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8211;1300&#8197;nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97&#8201;%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.

         <title>Exploiting the structural metamorphosis of polymers to &#8216;wrap&#8217;&#160;micron&#8208;sized spherical objects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is growing interest in developing methods to &#8216;wrap&#8217; nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects within films that may offer protection, enhance their stability or improve performance.&#160; We describe the successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film. This approach utilizes polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly cross&#8208;linked to intermoleculary cross&#8208;linked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur. This work is significant as it suggests that nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects such as virus&#8208;like particles, bacteria or mammalian cells&#8212;all of which may benefit from additional environmental protection or stabilization in emerging applications&#8212;may also be &#8216;wrapped&#8217; by this approach.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have invented a new route to synthesis of various mono N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides by involving in a new C&#8208;N bond formation using N&#8208;amino&#8208;&#8203;1,&#8203;8&#8208;&#8203;naphthalimide&#160;as a regenerated precursor. Aniline&#160;and phenylhydrazines &#160;are reproduced upon reacting these individually with 1,8&#8208;naphthalic anhydride&#160;followed by hydrazinolysis. The practicality and simplicity of this C&#8211;N bond formation protocol was exemplified to various hydrazines and hydrazides.

         <title>Interplay of Polarity and Confinement in Asymmetric Catalysis with Chiral Rh Diene Complexes in Microemulsions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microemulsions provide a unique opportunity to tailor the polarity and liquid confinement in asymmetric catalysis via nanoscale polar and nonpolar domains separated by a surfactant film. For chiral diene Rh complexes, the influence of counterion and surfactant film on the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity remained elusive. To explore this issue chiral norbornadiene Rh(X) complexes (X = OTf, OTs, OAc, PO  2  F  2  ) were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations. These complexes were used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;additions of phenylboroxine to  N&#8208;  tosylimine in microemulsions stabilized either exclusively by  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;  &#223;  &#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (C  8  G  1  ) or a C  8  G  1  &#8208;film doped with anionic or cationic surfactants (AOT, SDS and DTAB). The Rh(OAc) complex showed the largest dependence on the composition of the microemulsion, yielding up to 59&#160;%&#160;(90&#160;%ee) for the surfactant film doped with 5&#160;wt.% of AOT as compared to 52&#160;% (58&#160;%ee) for neat C  8  G  1  at constant surfactant concentration. The larger domains, determined by SAXS analysis, enabled an increase in yield and selectivity while the reaction rate almost remained constant according to kinetic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Total syntheses of conjugation&#8208;ready repeating units of Acinetobacter baumannii AB5075 for glycoconjugate vaccine development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acinetobacter baumannii  is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious nosocomial infections. One of the multidrug&#8208;resistant strains, AB5075, can result in bacteremia, pneumonia and wound infections associated with high morbidity and mortality. The structurally unique glycans on the surface of these bacteria are attractive targets for the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. Here, we report the first total synthesis of the densely functionalized trisaccharide repeating unit of  A. baumannii  AB5075 as well as two analogues. The construction of 1,2&#8208;  cis  linkages between the rare sugars relies on a double&#8208;serial inversion strategy. The judicious selection of building blocks and reaction conditions allowed for stereoselective glycosylations, the installation of acetamido groups and the (  S  )&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Azimuthal Dipolar Rotor Arrays on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of dipolar molecular rotor compounds was designed, synthesized and adsorbed as self&#8208;assembled 2D arrays on Ag(111) surfaces. The title molecules are constructed from three building blocks: (a) 4,8,12&#8208;trioxatriangulene (TOTA) platforms that are known to physisorb on metal surfaces such as Au(111) and Ag(111), (b) phenyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that function as pivot joints to reduce the barrier to rotation, (c) pyridine and pyridazine units as small dipolar units on top. Theoretical calculations and STM investigations hint at the fact that the dipoles of neighbouring rotors interact through space via pairs of energetically favourable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ  observation of  ferroelastic domain and phase transition in a three&#8208;dimensional molecular crystal.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Massive efforts have been devoted to designing molecular ferroic materials by molecular modification. For molecular ferroelastic, previous work is focused on the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelastic domains, however, few are related to controlling the ferroelastic domain by the stress. Inspired by the &#8220;quasi&#8208;spherical theory&#8221; and fluorination effect, we designed a more flexible (MedabcoF)  2+  (MedabcoF= 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) cation by introducing a methyl group and a fluorine atom at the two symmetrical ends of the Dabco (1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and synthesized a hybrid 3D perovskite (MedabcoF)Rb(BF  4  )  3  (1) which displays three reversible phase transitions accompanying dual ferroelastic behavior. Besides, it not only exhibits ferroelastic domains switching by the thermal stimulation, and the sensitive reaction of in situ domains under the stress of it is also realized. This work not only achieves a force&#8208;controlled ferroelastic domain but develops a more profound comprehension of the relationship between the thermal motion behavior of guest cations and the intriguing properties of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Access to Cyanated N&#8208;Heterocycles via Direct Flow&#8208;Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitriles are recurring motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile functional groups in synthetic chemistry. Despite recent progress, direct introduction of a nitrile moiety in heteroarenes remains challenging. Recent developments in electrochemical reactions pave the way to more practical cyanation protocols. However, currently available methods typically require hazardous cyanide sources, expensive mediators, and often suffer from narrow substrate scope and laborious reaction set&#8208;up. To address the limitations of current synthetic methods, we report here an effective, sustainable, and scalable procedure for the direct C(  sp  2  )&#8208;H cyanation of aromatic  N  &#8208;heterocycles with a user&#8208;friendly flow&#8208;electrochemical set&#8208;up. Furthermore, high substrate and functional group tolerance is demonstrated, allowing for late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug&#8208;like scaffolds such as natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel route for the easy production of thermochromic VO2 nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a simple, fast and dry method for the fabrication of a thermochromic product with a high load of VO  2  &#160;(M1) consisting of the controlled heat treatment of pure vanadium nanoparticles in air is presented. After a complete design of experiments, it is concluded that the most&#160;direct way to attain the maximum transformation of V into VO  2  (M1) consists of one cycle with a fast heating ramp of 42  o  Cs  &#8722;1  , followed by keeping 700  o  C for 530&#8208;600 seconds, and a subsequent cooling at 0.05  o  Cs  &#8722;1  . Careful examination of these results lead to a second optimum, even more suitable for industrial production (quicker and less energy&#8208;intensive because of its lower temperatures and shorter times), consisting of subjecting V to two consecutive cycles of temperatures and times (625  o  C for 5 minutes) with similar preheating&#160;but a much faster postcooling (~8  o  Cs  &#8722;1  ). These green reactions only use the power for heating a tube open to atmosphere and a vanadium precursor; without assistance of reactive gases or catalysts, and no special vacuum or pressure requirements. The best products present similar thermochromic properties but higher thermal stability than commercial VO  2  particles. These&#160;methods can be combined with VO  2  doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Putting anion&#8208;&#960; interactions at work for catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its discovery two decades ago, anion&#8211;&#960; interaction has been increasingly recognized as an important driving force. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts on the ground&#8208;state anion&#8211;&#960; binding and recognition have laid the bases for exploring its relevance in catalysis. Accordingly, the concept of &#8220;anion&#8211;&#960; catalysis&#8221; that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface (&#960;&#8208;acidic surface) for anionic reaction intermediate and transition state stabilization has emerged. This article shortly illustrates the emergence and development of this concept, aiming to provide an emphasis on the general concept and key progress in this exciting area. To highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8211;&#960; interactions, the contents are organized according to their role engaged in catalytic process, e.g. from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, mainly by a single &#960;&#8208;face, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation. A concluding remark and outlook on future development of this field is also given.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN peptide complexes increases ROS levels, DNA cleavage and antiproliferative activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the a &#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2 &#8594; &#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production ( . OH and H 2 O 2 ). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC 50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The modular synthesis of Au(I)/Ru(II) decorated mono&#8208; and heterobimetallic complexes with &#960;&#8208;conjugated [2.2]paracyclophane is described.

A broad set of architectural arrangements of pseudo &#8208;  gem  , &#8208;  ortho  , &#8208;  meta  , and &#8208;  para  substitution patterns were employed. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal distance modulation of AuRu heterobimetallic complexes and the innate transannular &#960;&#8208;communication of the cyclophanyl scaffold provides a promising platform for the investigations of structure&#8208;activity relationship and cooperative effects.

         <title>Rhodium Indenyl NHC and Fluorenyl&#8208;Tethered&#8208;NHC Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Applications in the Catalytic C&#8208;H Borylation of Arenes and Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indenyl&#160;rhodium NHC complexes [Rh(&#951;5&#8208;Ind)(NHC)(L)] were synthesised for SIPr&#160;with L = C2H4  (1), CO (2a) and COE (3), for SIMes&#160;with L = CO (2b) and COE (4), and IMes&#160;with L = CO (2c) and COE (5). Reaction of SIPr with [Rh(Cp*)(C2H4)2] did not give the desired SIPr complex demonstrating the &#8216;indenyl effect&#8217; in the synthesis of  1  . Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3  to  3  proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6).&#160;Tethered&#8208;fluorenyl&#8208;NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5&#8208;C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4  :  11, L=COE:  12  , L=CO:  13; R=Mes, L=COE:  14  , L=CO:  15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE:  16  , L=CO:  17) were also synthesised.  3  and  1  were the best catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene using B2pin2  (97% and 93% PhBpin respectively with 5 mol% catalyst, 24 hr, 80&#176;C), with SIPr a better ligand than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl&#8208;tethered&#8208;NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2  at 120&#176;C and 140&#176;C respectively showed high conversions by NMR spectroscopy&#160;into octyl and decylBpin over 4 &#8211; 7 days demonstrating catalysed sp3  C&#8208;H borylation. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420 nm light confirmed the dissociation of alkene&#160;ligands whereas CO complexes were inert. Evidence for C&#8208;H bond activation in the alkyl groups of the NHC ligands was obtained.</dc:description>

Oxidative addition of HSi(OEt)3  to  3  proceeded under mild conditions to give the Rh silyl hydride complex [Rh(Ind){Si(OEt)3}(H)(SIPr)] (6).&#160;Tethered-fluorenyl-NHC rhodium complexes [Rh{(&#951;5-C13H8)C2H4N(C)C2HxR}(L)] (x=4, R=Dipp, L=C2H4  :  11, L=COE:  12  , L=CO:  13; R=Mes, L=COE:  14  , L=CO:  15; x=2, R=Me, L=COE:  16  , L=CO:  17) were also synthesised.  3  and  1  were the best catalysts for the catalytic borylation of benzene using B2pin2  (97% and 93% PhBpin respectively with 5 mol% catalyst, 24 hr, 80&#176;C), with SIPr a better ligand than SIMes or IMes. Fluorenyl-tethered-NHC complexes were much less active as borylation catalysts, and the carbonyl complexes were inactive. The borylation of toluene, biphenyl, anisole and diphenyl ether proceeded to give meta substitutions as the major product. The borylation of octane and decane with B2pin2  at 120&#176;C and 140&#176;C respectively showed high conversions by NMR spectroscopy&#160;into octyl and decylBpin over 4 &#8211; 7 days demonstrating catalysed sp3  C-H borylation. Irradiation of the monodentate complexes with 400 or 420 nm light confirmed the dissociation of alkene&#160;ligands whereas CO complexes were inert. Evidence for C-H bond activation in the alkyl groups of the NHC ligands was obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectral Signatures of Oxidation States in a Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>

Tracing fingerprints. Key IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures to differentiate oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;oxo vanadate catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n&#8211; are identified. During oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn
], in the UV/Vis spectrum a band at about 570&#8197;nm increases while another one at 850&#8197;nm vanishes. In the IR spectra, oxidation leads to a remarkable shift of the V=O stretch mode to higher energies.







Abstract
We report IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic signatures that allow discriminating between the oxidation states of the manganese&#8208;based water oxidation catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]3&#8722;. Simulated IR spectra show that V=O stretching vibrations in the 900&#8211;1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region shift consistently by about 20&#8197;cm&#8722;1 per oxidation equivalent. Multiple bands in the 1450&#8211;1550&#8197;cm&#8722;1 region also change systematically upon oxidation/reduction. The computed UV/Vis spectra predict that the spectral range above 350&#8197;nm is characteristic of the managanese&#8208;oxo cubane oxidation state, whereas transitions at higher energy are due to the vanadate ligand. The presence of absorption signals above 680&#8197;nm is indicative of the presence of MnIII atoms. Spectroelectrochemical measurements of the oxidation from [Mn
Mn
] to [Mn
] showed that the change in oxidation state can indeed be tracked by both IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and growth mechanisms of spherical particles of infinite coordination polymers (ICPs) is discussed. Main reported applications for micro&#8208; and nanospheres of ICPs exhibiting luminescent behavior are presented, including chemical sensing, light emission, bioimaging and templating by using topotactic transformations. Additional insights on the challenges for future applications are also given.







Abstract
Coordination polymers have been extensively studied in recent years. Some of these materials can exhibit several properties such as permanent porosity, high surface area, thermostability and light emission, as well as open sites for chemical functionalization. Concerning the fact that this kind of compounds are usually solids, the size and morphology of the particles are important parameters when an application is desired. Inside this context, there is a subclass of coordination polymers, named infinite coordination polymers (ICPs), which auto&#8208;organize as micro&#8208; or nanoparticles with low crystallinity. Specifically, the particles exhibiting spherical shapes and reduced sizes can be better dispersed, enter cells much easier than bulk crystals and be converted to inorganic materials by topotactic transformation. Luminescent ICPs, in particular, can find applications in several areas, such as sensing probes, light&#8208;emitting devices and bioimaging. In this review, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of ICP&#8208;based spherical particles, including the growth mechanisms, some applications for luminescent ICPs and the challenges to overcome in future commercial usage of these materials.

         <title>CdS Reinforced with CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH Core&#8208;shell Co&#8208;catalyst Demonstrate High Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Durability in Anhydrous Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new core&#8208;shell structured co&#8208;catalyst CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH and CdS are coupled by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly to form a composite catalyst 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS, which exhibits high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen evolution performance and stability under visible light (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm). CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH provides sufficient space for the effective load of CdS. Meanwhile, the effective interface contact accelerates the transfer of electrons and jointly promotes the precipitation of hydrogen.







Abstract
At present, inefficient charge separation of single photocatalyst impedes the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, the CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH core&#8208;shell co&#8208;catalyst was cleverly designed, which exhibit high activity and high stability of hydrogen evolution in anhydrous ethanol system when coupled with CdS. Under visible light (&#955;&#8805;420&#8197;nm) irradiation, the 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS composite photocatalyst exhibits a surprisingly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 20.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 59&#8197;times than that of the original CdS. Continuous light for 20&#8197;h still showed good cycle stability. In addition, the 3&#8201;%Co/NiCo/CdS composite catalyst also shows good hydrogen evolution performance under the Na2S/Na2SO3 and lactic acid system. The fluorescence (PL), ultraviolet&#8208;visible diffuse reflectance (UV&#8208;vis) and photoelectrochemical tests show that the coupling of CdS and CoSX/NiCo&#8208;LDH not only accelerates the effective transfer of charges, but also greatly increases the absorption range of CdS to visible light. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution activity of the composite photocatalyst has been significantly improved. This work will provide new insights for the construction of new co&#8208;catalysts and the development of composite catalysts for hydrogen evolution in multiple systems.

Best of both worlds: The thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene with two C=N bonds (TAP) was synthesized as a stable compound. The fused thiophene rings restored the antiaromatic character of the 8&#960;&#8208;electron system diminished by C=N doping while imparting thermal stability. TAP readily underwent hydrogenation owing to the pronounced aromaticity of the hydrogenated product. Moreover, the high electrophilicity of C=N bonds of TAP led to dense &#960;&#8208;stacking in the solid state.







Abstract
A thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N&#8208;containing 4n&#8201;&#960;&#8208;electron system that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene moiety resulted in a much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the eight&#8208;membered&#8208;ring periphery caused by stabilization of the less&#8208;stable bond&#8208;shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and the high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H2&#8208;TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;&#8208;stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

&lt;p&gt;A thiophene-fused 1,4-diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N-containing 4n&#8201;&#960;-electron system that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X-ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4-diazapentalene moiety resulted in a much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4-diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the eight-membered-ring periphery caused by stabilization of the less-stable bond-shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and the high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;-stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;-electron systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosylbarbiturates into Multiresponsive Alginate&#8208;Like Supramolecular Hydrogel Fibers and Vesicle Hydrogel</title>

         <dc:description>
Barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation on unprotected carbohydrates enabled the molecular design of amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl barbiturates as hydrogelators. The single&#8208;tailed glycoamphiphiles self&#8208;assembled into alginate&#8208;like multistimuli&#8208;triggered and responsive supramolecular hydrogel fibers. While, the double&#8208;tailed glycoamphiphiles led to vesicle hydrogels. Barbituric acid proves to be an efficient and versatile chemical toolbox for the access and design of glycoconjugates.







Abstract
Ordered molecular self&#8208;assembly of glycoamphiphiles has been regarded as an attractive, practical and bottom&#8208;up approach to obtain stable, structurally well&#8208;defined, and functional mimics of natural polysaccharides. This study describes a versatile and rational design of carbohydrate&#8208;based hydrogelators through N,N&#8217;&#8208;substituted barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation onto unprotected carbohydrates in water. Amphiphilic N&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;maltosylbarbiturates self&#8208;assembled into pH&#8208; and calcium&#8208;triggered alginate&#8208;like supramolecular hydrogel fibers with a multistimuli responsiveness to temperature, pH and competitive metal chelating agent. In addition, amphiphilic N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;maltosylbarbiturates formed vesicle gels in pure water that were scarcely observed for glyco&#8208;hydrogelators. Finally, barbituric acid worked as a multitasking group allowing chemoselective ligation onto reducing&#8208;end carbohydrates, structural diversity, stimuli&#8208;sensitiveness, and supramolecular interactions by hydrogen bonding.

         <title>The Preparation of a Water&#8208;Soluble Phospholate&#8208;Based Macrocycle for Constructing Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based macrocycle (WPCTX) was prepared with satisfying yield and its host&#8208;guest properties were investigated. Based on this, tetraphenylethylene guest molecules (G) self&#8208;assembled with WPCTX to form WPCTX&#8835;G nanoparticles (NPs) acting as donors in water. Moreover, two hydrophobic fluorescent dyes, Eosin Y (ESY) and Nile red (NiR), were encapsulated in NPs to construct artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems with high antenna effect.







Abstract
On the basis of cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX), a novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based CTX derivative (WPCTX) was prepared with facile synthetic procedure and satisfying yield. Several model guest molecules were selected to investigate WPCTX&#8242;s host&#8208;guest properties. Based on the study of the host and model guest complexation, a tetraphenylethylene derivative from model guest was employed as a guest molecule (G) to form WPCTX&#8835;G nanoparticles (NPs) with WPCTX through further supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in water. Moreover, a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Eosin Y(ESY) or Nile red (NiR), was encapsulated in WPCTX&#8835;G NPs to construct two types of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems. Their high antenna effect demonstrated such NPs successfully mimicked light&#8208;harvesting systems in nature.

         <title>Iodine(I) and Silver(I) Complexes of Benzoimidazole and Pyridylcarbazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver(I) complexes of benzoimidazole and carbazole&#8208;derived sp2 N&#8208;containing Lewis bases are synthesized and the isostructural iodine(I) complexes with a strong 3&#8208;center 4&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond are obtained through the [N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N]+&#8594;[N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ cation exchange reaction. The unambiguous confirmation of the complex formation is obtained in the solution state using NMR spectroscopy, and in the solid&#8208;state, with single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The synthesis of iodine(I) complexes with either benzoimidazole or carbazole&#8208;derived sp2 N&#8208;containing Lewis bases is described, as well as their corresponding silver(I) complexes. The addition of elemental iodine to the linear two&#8208;coordinate Ag(I) complexes produces iodine(I) complexes with a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ bond. The 1H and 1H&#8208;15N HMBC NMR studies unambiguously confirm the formation of the complexes in all cases via the [N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N]+&#8594;[N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ cation exchange, with the 15N NMR chemical shift change between 94 to 111&#8197;ppm when compared to the free ligand. The single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on eight I+ complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ bonds with I&#8722;N bond distances of 2.21&#8211;2.26&#8197;&#197; and N&#8722;I&#8722;N angles of 177&#8211;180&#176;, whilst some of the corresponding Ag+ complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N angles of ca. 150&#176; and Ag&#8722;N bond distances of 2.09&#8211;2.18&#8197;&#197;.

Abstract
Recently published syntheses, reactions and characterizations of unusual unsaturated ring strained Group 4 metallocene metallacycles like metalla&#8208;cyclocumulenes, &#8208;cycloallenes and &#8208;cycloalkynes with different ring size are updated for the last three years. There exist for some of these metallacycles, depending on the ring size, 7&#8208;, 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered compounds. The new results for these metallacycles are summarized here and considered in addition to the former published results. Additionally, several compounds of this type were now characterized by new reactions. For a better understanding of these compounds, some spectroscopical methods as well as theoretical calculations were published. Despite of these all&#8208;C&#8208;metallacycles, only in some cases the syntheses and reactions for the corresponding hetero&#8208;metallacycles were published too. Examples for these metallaheterocyclic compounds will not be considered in this article. All these unusual ring strained compounds have a great potential for a lot of interesting synthetic applications in the future. Additionally, they are very interesting from the theoretical point of view.

         <title>Water&#8208;Assisted Chemical Route Towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction at the Hydrated (110) Ruthenium Oxide Surface: Heterogeneous Catalysis via DFT&#8208;MD and Metadynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the hydrated (110)&#8208;RuO2 catalyst surface revealing a noticeable water&#8208;assisted reaction pathway where the explicit water environment acts as co&#8208;catalyst enhancing the OER.







Abstract
Notwithstanding that RuO2 is a promising catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a plethora of fundamental details on its catalytic properties are still elusive, severely limiting its large&#8208;scale deployment. It is also established experimentally that corrosion and wettability of metal oxides can, in fact, enhance the catalytic activity for OER owing to the formation of a hydrated surface layer. However, the mechanistic interplay between surface wettability, interfacial water dynamics and OER across RuO2, and what degree these processes are correlated are still debated. Herein, spin&#8208;polarized Density Functional Theory Molecular Dynamics (DFT&#8208;MD) simulations, coupled with advanced enhanced sampling methods in the well&#8208;tempered metadynamics framework, are applied to gain a global understanding of RuO2 aqueous interface (explicit water solvent) in catalyzing the OER, and hence possibly help in the design of novel catalysts in the context of photochemical water oxidation. The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the (110)&#8208;RuO2 catalyst surface revealing plausible pathways composing the reaction network of the O2 evolution. In particular, OER is investigated at room temperature when such a surface is exposed to both gas&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase water. Albeit a unique efficient pathway has been identified in the gas&#8208;phase OER, a surprisingly lowest&#8208;free&#8208;energy&#8208;requiring reaction route is possible when (110)&#8208;RuO2 is in contact with explicit liquid water. By estimating the free&#8208;energy surfaces associated to these processes, we reveal a noticeable water&#8208;assisted OER mechanism which involves a crucial proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;step assisted by the local water environment. These findings pave the way toward the systematic usage of DFT&#8208;MD coupled with metadynamics techniques for the fine assessment of the activity of catalysts, considering finite&#8208;temperature and explicit&#8208;solvent effects.

         <title>The E2 state of FeMoco: Hydride Formation versus Fe Reduction and a Mechanism for H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydride formation versus Fe reduction: Hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics calculations were used to explore the the E2 redox state of the iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase. Two stable isomers were found: a bridging hydride model (with an open belt sulfide&#8208;bridge) and a non&#8208;hydride model (with two belt sulfides protonated and reduced Fe). A path back to the resting state, by H2 evolution via a hydride&#8208;proton reaction was found.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is responsible for dinitrogen reduction in Mo nitrogenase. Unlike the resting state, E0, reduced states of FeMoco are much less well characterized. The E2 state has been proposed to contain a hydride but direct spectroscopic evidence is still lacking. The E2 state can, however, relax back the E0 state via a H2 side&#8208;reaction, implying a hydride intermediate prior to H2 formation. This E2&#8594;E0 pathway is one of the primary mechanisms for H2 formation under low&#8208;electron flux conditions. In this study we present an exploration of the energy surface of the E2 state. Utilizing both cluster&#8208;continuum and QM/MM calculations, we explore various classes of E2 models: including terminal hydrides, bridging hydrides with a closed or open sulfide&#8208;bridge, as well as models without. Importantly, we find the hemilability of a protonated belt&#8208;sulfide to strongly influence the stability of hydrides. Surprisingly, non&#8208;hydride models are found to be almost equally favorable as hydride models. While the cluster&#8208;continuum calculations suggest multiple possibilities, QM/MM suggests only two models as contenders for the E2 state. These models feature either i) a bridging hydride between Fe2 and Fe6 and an open sulfide&#8208;bridge (terminal SH on Fe6) (E2&#8208;hyd) or ii) a double belt&#8208;sulfide protonated, reduced cofactor without a hydride (E2&#8208;nonhyd). We suggest both models as contenders for the E2 redox state and further calculate a mechanism for H2 evolution. The changes in electronic structure of FeMoco during the proposed redox&#8208;state cycle, E0&#8594;E1&#8594;E2&#8594;E0, are discussed.

         <title>The Photophysics and Photochemistry of Melanin&#8208; Like Nanomaterials Depend on Morphology and Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melanin&#8208;like materials can be easily prepared from simple precursors upon controlled oxidation/polymerization. In the resulting system, species with different structure and morphology coexist and interact. The overall photophysical and photochemical properties depend in part on the nature of the chromophores formed but also, to a large extent, on the interchromophoric interactions as typical for supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
Melanin&#8208;like nanomaterials have found application in a large variety of high economic and social impact fields as medicine, energy conversion and storage, photothermal catalysis and environmental remediation. These materials have been used mostly for their optical and electronic properties, but also for their high biocompatibility and simplicity and versatility of preparation. Beside this, their chemistry is complex and it yields structures with different molecular weight and composition ranging from oligomers, to polymers as well as nanoparticles (NP). The comprehension of the correlation of the different compositions and morphologies to the optical properties of melanin is still incomplete and challenging, even if it is fundamental also from a technological point of view. In this minireview we focus on scientific papers, mostly recent ones, that indeed examine the link between composition and structural feature and photophysical and photochemical properties proposing this approach as a general one for future research.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial biomimetic chromophore&#8208;protein complexes inspired by natural visual pigments can feature color tunability across the full visible spectrum. However, control of excited state dynamics of the retinal chromophore, which is of paramount importance for technological applications, is lacking due to its complex and subtle photophysics/photochemistry.

         <title>4&#8208;Phosphoryl pyrazolones for highly selective lithium separation from alkali metal ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective receptors for the separation of Li + from a mixture with other alkali metal ions under mild conditions remains an important challenge that could benefit from new approaches. In this study, it is demonstrated that the 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones, H  L  2  &#8208;H  L  4  , in the presence of the typical industrial organophosphorus co&#8208;ligands tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), tributylphosphate (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), are able to selectively recognise and extract lithium ions from aqueous solution. Structural investigations in solution as well as in the solid state reveal the existence of a series of multinuclear Li  +  complexes that include dimers (TBPO, TBP) as well as rarely observed trimers (TOPO) and represent the first clear evidence for the synergistic role of the co&#8208;ligands in the extraction process. Our findings are supported by detailed NMR, MS and extraction studies. Liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in the presence of TOPO revealed an unprecedented high Li  +  extraction efficiency (78%) for H  L  4  compared to the use of the industrially employed acylpyrazolone H  L  1  (15%) and benzoyl&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroacetone (52%) extractants. In addition, a high selectivity for Li  +  over Na  +  , K  +  and Cs  +  under mild conditions (pH ~ 8.2) confirms that H  L  2  &#8208;H  L  4  represent a class of ligands that are very effective extractants for use in lithium separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Systems on the Surface of Functionalized Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs) Utilizing Hamilton Receptors and Cyanurate Derivative Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of hydrogen bonding interactions at the level of functionalized nanoparticles remains highly challenging and poorly explored area. In this work, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were orthogonally functionalized using receptors bearing multiple hydrogen bonding motifs. Pristine SPIONs were modified by wet chemical processes with Hamilton receptors (hosts), or cyanurate&#8208;guest molecules linked to phosphonic acid moieties for monolayer functionalization. The modified surfaces were fully characterized and the number of attached ligands on the surface were determined. The host&#8208;guest interactions on the interface of modified SPIONs were investigated by using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titrations. Functionalized SPIONs demonstrated two to three magnitudes stronger binding affinities as compared to the related molecular interactions in solution due to synergistic effects on complex surface environment. Higher supramolecular binding ratios of host&#8208;guest interactions on the modified surface were emerged. These studies provide fundamental insights into supramolecular complexions on the surface at solid&#8208;liquid interface systems to have deeper understanding for applications in engineered nanomaterials, nano&#8208;sensing devices, and drug delivery systems, which utilize host&#8208;guest supramolecular chemistry interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy Production of &#8220;Difficult Peptides&#8221; using Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis and a New Methionine Analogue as a Latent Peptide Cleavage Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic &#947;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporated in place of their canonical analogues through cell&#8208;free protein synthesis act as heat&#8208;labile linkers, offering a useful strategy for the straightforward production of target peptides as fusion proteins, from which the targets are readily released. Until now, the natural abundance of aliphatic amino acids in peptides has limited the scope of the method, as it leads to undesired cleavage sites in synthesized products, but here we report the development of a new cleavable chloro amino acid that incorporates in place of the relatively rare amino acid methionine, thus greatly expanding the scope of producible targets. This new strategy is employed for simplified peptide synthesis with a methionine&#8208;free fusion partner, allowing single&#8208;site incorporation of the cleavable linker for clean release and easy purification of the target peptide. Its utility is demonstrated through the straightforward preparation of two peptides reported to be challenging targets and not accessible through standard solid&#8208;phase chemical methodologies, as well as analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lead Mixed Halide with Three Different Coordinated Anions and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are widely applied in information technology, micro&#8208;manufacturing and medical treatment. Herein, a new lead mixed halide with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 represents the rare NLO crystal featuring that three different anions (I&#8208;, Br&#8208; and O2&#8208;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom to form a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron with a large polarizability. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 not only exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching SHG response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), but also possesses a large birefringence (0.27@1064nm) and high laser damage threshold (LDT). The strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains. This study points out an effective strategy to develop new NLO crystals with strong SHG response.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Iron Doping and Cyano Groups for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production over C3N4</title>

         <dc:description>Improving the insufficient  carrier separation  dynamics is still of significant in  carbon  nitride (C  3  N  4  )  research  . Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the  synergistic enhancement  effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group&#8208;containing Fe&#8208;doped C  3  N  4  porous materials via direct co&#8208;calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine  for  synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation  of cyano groups and form Fe&#8208;doping  in C  3  N  4  , thereby increasing the visible&#8208;light absorption and reactive sites.  Further, the internal donor&#8208;acceptor  system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e  &#8208;  &#8208;h  +  pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C  3  N  4  (BCN).</dc:description>

However, conventional UCL materials which all work as multiphoton absorption (MPA) process, inevitably need extremely high power density far over the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to laser. Here, an one&#8208;photon absorption molecular upconversion sensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br based on frequency upconversion luminescent (FUCL) is designed for PDT. The unusual super heavy atom effect (SHAE) in Cy5.5&#8208;Br strongly enhance its spin&#8208;orbit coupling (0.23 cm&#8208;1), triplet quantum yield (11.1%) and triplet state lifetime (18.8 &#956;s) while the potential hot&#8208;band absoption of Cy5.5&#8208;Br are well maintained. Importantly, Cy5.5&#8208;Br can efficiently target to the tumour site and kill cancer cells by destroying mitochondria under a biosafety MPE to 808 nm laser. The photostability and antitumor results are obviously superior to that of Stoke process. This work first provide a design criterion for FUCL dyes to realize effective PDT upon a biosafety optical density, possibly being more clinical benefits than conventional MPA materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Graphene&#8217;s excellent electrical conductivity benefits from its highly&#8208;conjugated structure. Therefore, the manipulation of graphene&#8217;s electronic and mechanical properties can be realized by controlled destruction of its in&#8208;sheet conjugation system. Herein, we report the preparation of CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at molecular level. In detail, sodium alginate was compounded with Co  2+  and Ce  3+  , the composite was loaded onto graphene. The graphene sheets are propped by bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid the re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets allow the creation of nanometer&#8208;sized space between them. The BPMW have 33.2&#176; angle between coplanar pyrene group and benzene groups, graphene layers were propped in tilt direction. Finally, the three&#8208;dimensional porous composite was obtained after annealing and vulcanization. The resulting CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO shows excellent electrical conductivity and remarkable cycle stability, and high specific capacitance of 1004 F g  &#8208;1  when the current density is 1 A g  &#8208;1  . The excellent electrochemical performance should benefit from the modification of graphene by BPMW via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions and synergistic effect resulted from the special structure. Moreover, a solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor device is fabricated based on the synthesized CoCeS  x  &#8208;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid, and exhibits a power density of 979 W kg  &#8208;1  at the energy density of 23.96 W h kg  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic(thio)ethers is reported via a simple strategy relying on carbon&#8208;chalcogen bond activation with difluorocarbene. The reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ protonation of the previously little&#8208;known difluoromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylide intermediate followed by ring&#8208;opening with halide ion to afford halogenated acyclic difluoromethyl (thio)ethers that can then be employed for further elaboration. TMSCF2X (X = Br, Cl) are unique reagents to achieve this synthetic purpose, which serve as both the difluorocarbene source and the halide ion source.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne Aminopalladation/Heck and Suzuki Cascades: An Approach to Tetrasubstituted Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal alkynes have been used in combination with tosylamides and the Narasaka leaving group to form tetra(hetero)substituted enamines in an aminopalladation cascade reaction. The cascade was terminated either intramolecularly by a Heck reaction or intermolecularly in a Suzuki&#8208;type reaction with a boronic acid.







Abstract
Alkyne aminopalladation reactions starting from tosylamides are reported. The emerging vinylic Pd species are converted either in an intramolecular Heck reaction with olefinic units or in an intermolecular Suzuki reaction by using boronic acids exhibiting broad functional group tolerance. Tetra(hetero)substituted tosylated enamines are obtained in a simple one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy and Electronic Structure of Mono&#8208;and Dinuclear Pyridyl&#8208;Triazole/DPEPhos&#8208;Based Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comprehensive results on two mononuclear pyridyl&#8208;triazole/DPEPhos based Cu(I) complexes and its extension to their two dinuclear analogues paves the road to addressing the complex coupling of the respective monomeric units, involving various physical and chemical properties as charge, (electronic) structure and (long&#8208;lived) excited state properties, relevant for applications.







Abstract
Chemical and spectroscopic characterization of the mononuclear photosensitizers [(DPEPhos)Cu(I)(MPyrT)]0/+ (CuL, CuLH) and their dinuclear analogues (Cu2L&#8217;, Cu2L'H2), backed by (TD)DFT and high&#8208;level GW&#8208;Bethe&#8208;Salpeter equation calculations, exemplifies the complex influence of charge, nuclearity and structural flexibility on UV&#8208;induced photophysical pathways. Ultrafast transient absorption and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy reveal flattening distortion in the triplet state of CuLH as controlled by charge, which also appears to have a large impact on the symmetry of the long&#8208;lived triplet states in Cu2L&#8217; and Cu2L'H2. Time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy (solid state), supported by transient photodissociation spectroscopy (gas phase), confirm a lifetime of some tens of &#956;s for the respective triplet states, as well as the energetics of thermally activated delayed luminescence, both being essential parameters for application of these materials based on earth&#8208;abundant copper in photocatalysis and luminescent devices.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a systematic study of halogenate(I/III) anions with polyatomic ligands. The bis(perfluoro&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I) [X(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  , X = Cl, Br, I, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are prepared as their tetraethylammonium salts and characterized with IR, Raman and NMR spectroscopic methods as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Spectroscopical data are supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Additionally, the bonding situation of the species in question are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, we studied the oxidation to the corresponding halogenate(III) derivatives. For [Br(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  oxidation with elemental fluorine yielded [BrF  2  (OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  . Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC  4  F  9  to the I  III  species [I(OC  4  F  9  )  4  ]  &#8722;  which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future. For [Cl(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  the decomposition products of the synthetic approaches towards a chlorine(III) system were analyzed.</dc:description>

Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC  4  F  9  to the I  III  species [I(OC  4  F  9  )  4  ]  &#8722;  which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future. For [Cl(OC  4  F  9  )  2  ]  &#8722;  the decomposition products of the synthetic approaches towards a chlorine(III) system were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergy of Bi2O3 and RuO2 nanocatalysts for low&#8208;overpotential and wide pH&#8208;window electrochemical ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is still seriously impeded by the inferior NH3  yield and low Faradic efficiency, especially at low overpotentials. Herein, we report the synthesis of nano&#8208;sized RuO2  and Bi2O3  particles grown on functionalized exfoliated graphene (FEG) through in&#8208;situ electrodeposition, denoted as RuO2&#8208;Bi2O3/FEG. The prepared self&#8208;supporting RuO2&#8208;Bi2O3/FEG hybrid with a Bi mass loading of 0.70 wt% and Ru mass loading of 0.04 wt% shows excellent NRR performance at low overpotentials in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes. It achieves a large NH  3  yield of 4.58 &#177; 0.16 &#956;gNH3h&#8208;1cm&#8208;2  with a high Faradaic efficiency of 14.6% at &#8208;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4  electrolyte. This performance benefits from the synergistic effect between Bi2O3  and RuO2  which respectively have a fairly strong interaction of Bi 6p orbitals with the N 2p band and abundant supply of *H, as well as the binder&#8208;free characteristic and the convenient electron transfer via graphene nanosheets. This work highlights a new electrocatalyst design strategy that combines transition and main&#8208;group metal elements, which may provide some inspirations for designing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance NRR electrocatalysts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aqueous Neptunium(III) Halide Solvates from NpO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two Np (III) halides, NpI 3 (THF) 4 and NpBr 3 (THF) 4 , have been prepared and isolated in high yields as described in this work. Starting with neptunia (NpO 2 ), NpCl 4 (DME) 2 was first generated in an updated, higher yielding synthesis than what was previously reported using HCl/HF. This material was then reduced with KC 8 , followed by subsequent ligand exchange, to generate NpBr 3 (THF) 4 and NpI 3 &#8208;(THF) 4 . Full characterization by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1 H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the molecular formulas and oxidation states. These trivalent materials are straightforward to synthesize and can be used as starting materials for non&#8208;aqueous Np(III) chemistry, obviating the need for rare and restricted Np metal and elemental halogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Benzothiadiazole Derivatives as Fluorescence Imaging Dyes: A Decade of a New Generation Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD&#8208;containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several urea&#8208;inserted organo&#8208;polyoxometalates (POMs) derived from polyoxotungstovanadate [P  2  V  3  W  15  O  61  ]  9&#8211;  were prepared. The insertion of the carbonyl into the polyoxometallic framework activates the urea toward Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis. This was shown on the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of  trans  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Modelling shows that the most stable form of the organo&#8208;POMs features a  cis&#8208;trans  arrangement of the two N&#8211;H bonds, but that the likely catalytically active  trans&#8208;trans  form is accessible at room temperature. Finally, it is possible that the oxo substituents next to the vanadium atoms may help the approach of the nucleophile via H&#8208;bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow via Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of room&#8208;temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials, as well as the transformation of their photophysical properties, has emerged as an important topic in the research field of luminescent materials. Here we report the establishment of energy landscape in dopant&#8208;matrix organic afterglow systems where the aggregation states of luminescent dopants can be controlled by doping concentrations in the matrices and the material preparation methods. Through the manipulation via thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic stable aggregation state of the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials have been found to lead to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation behaviors triggered by thermal and solvent annealing. The reversible afterglow transformation process that is thermodynamically unfavorable can also be achieved by coupling the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system to mechanical forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal catalysis has revolutionized synthetic chemistry, leading to entirely new, very efficient transformations, which enable access to complex functionalized molecules. One such new transformation method is the haloalkynylation reaction, in which both a halogen atom and an alkynyl unit are transferred to an unsaturated carbon&#8211;carbon bond. This minireview summarizes the developments of metal&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions since their beginning about a decade ago. So far, arynes, alkenes and alkynes have been used as unsaturated systems and the reactivities of these systems are summarized in individual chapters of the minireview. Especially, the last few years have witnessed a rapid development due to gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, we discuss how the choice of the catalytic system influences the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Jahn&#8211;Teller Effects in a Vanadate&#8208;Stabilized Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Heuristic rules that allow identifying the preferred mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis arrangements in the&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;water oxidation catalyst [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; and its activated form [(Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;n&#8208;&lt;/sup&gt; are&lt;br /&gt;derived. These rules are based on computing all combinatorially possible mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis&lt;br /&gt;arrangements of the Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; atoms, and associate energetic costs with some structural features, like crossings of multiple&lt;br /&gt;Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axes, the location of these axes, or the involved ligands. It is found that the different oxidation states localize&lt;br /&gt;on different Mn centers, giving rise to clear Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller distortions, unlike in previous crystallographic findings where an&lt;br /&gt;apparent valence delocalization was found. The low barriers that connect different Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis arrangements suggest&lt;br /&gt;that the system quickly interconverts between them, leading to the observation of averaged bond lengths in the crystal&lt;br /&gt;structure. We conclude that the combination of cubane&#8208;vanadate bonds that are chemically inert, cubane&#8208;acetate/water&lt;br /&gt;bonds that can be activated through a Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axis, and low activation barriers for intramolecular rearrangement of&lt;br /&gt;the Jahn&amp;ndash;Teller axes plays an essential role in the reactivity of this and probably related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Series of lanthanide&#8208;containing metallic coordination complexes are frequently presented as structurally analogous, due to the similar chemical and coordinative properties of the lanthanides. In the case of chiral (Ln  III  [15&#8208;MC  Cu  II  N(L&#8208;pheHA)  &#8208;5])  3+  metallacrowns (MCs), which are well established supramolecular hosts, the formation of dimers templated by a dicarboxylate guest (muconate) in solution of neutral pH is herein shown to have a unique dependence on the identity of the MC&#8217;s central lanthanide.&#160;Calorimetric data and nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion studies demonstrate that MCs containing larger or smaller lanthanides as the central metal only form monomeric host&#8208;guest complexes whereas analogues with intermediate lanthanides (  e.g.  , Eu, Gd, Dy)&#160; participate in formation of dimeric host&#8208;guest&#8208;host compartments. The driving force for the dimerization event across the series is thought to be a competition between formation of highly stable MCs (larger lanthanides) and optimally linked bridging guests (smaller lanthanides).</dc:description>

         <title>Explaining the Advantageous Impact of Tertiary versus Secondary Nitrogen Centre on the Activity of PNP&#8208;Pincer Co(I)&#8208;Complexes for Catalytic Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pincer ligated coordination complexes of base metals have shown remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO  2  .&#160;The recently reported MeN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP&#8208;pincer complex was shown to exhibit substantially higher catalytic activity in comparison to the corresponding catalyst,&#160; HN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP, bearing a secondary nitrogen center on the pincer ligand. Here, we computationally investigate the mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO  2  to formate catalyzed by these two Co&#8208;PNP complexes to explain how such a small structural difference could have a sizable impact on their catalytic activity. Plausible hydrogenation routes were examined in details and our findings provide solid support for the experimental observations. Our results reveal that such trends in catalytic activity could be explained from the lower activation barrier for the hydride transfer step upon changing the pincer nitrogen center from secondary to tertiary.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective [2+2+1] Hydrative Annulation of Phenol&#8208;Linked 1,6&#8208;Enynes With Acetylenes Through Rhodium Catalysis: A Rapid Access to Cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;type Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bicyclic amido&#8208;substituted silicon(I) ring compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  2  (Mes = Mesityl = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  ) features enhanced zwitterionic character and different reactivity compared to the analogous compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Dipp}  4  1  (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) due to the smaller mesityl substituents. In a reaction with the  N  heterocyclic carbene (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene = NHC  Me4  ) we observe adduct formation to Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  (  3  ). This adduct reacts further with the Lewis acid BH  3  to yield the Lewis acid base complex Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  &#8729;BH  3  (  4  ). Coordination of AlBr  3  to  2  leads to the adduct  5  . Calculated proton affinities and fluoride ion affinities reveal highly Lewis basic and very weak Lewis acidic character of the low&#8208;valent silicon atoms in  1  and  2  . This is confirmed by protonation of  1  and  2  with Brookharts acid yielding  6  and  7  . Reactions with diphenylacetylene only occur at 111 &#176;C with  2  in toluene and are accompanied by a fragmentation of  2  to afford the silacyclopropene  8  and the trisilanorbornadiene species  9  .</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminum Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n = 1&#8211;10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated aluminum cations are investigated as a photochemical model system with up to 10 water molecules by UV action spectroscopy in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT&#8208;ICR) mass spectrometer. Intense photodissociation has been observed starting at 4.5 eV ranging from two to eight water molecules by loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for  n  = 2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s&#8208;3p excitations of Al+  into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5 eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1  to T2  takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2  surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1  . On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminum, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminum dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed up to  n  = 8. Clusters with  n  = 9,10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For  n  = 4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n  and HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  is present in the experiment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper reports the first example of C&#8211;H arylation of benzene under mild conditions, using H  2  as an electron source {turnover numbers (TONs) = 0.7&#8211;2.0 for 24 h}. The reaction depends on a Rh&#8208;based electron storage catalyst, and proceeds at room temperature and in aqueous solution.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes via dehydrogenative coupling of alkylnylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones. 36 compounds were synthesized for the first time applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalizations (e.g., hydrosilylation). &#160;The use of primary silanes as substrates and pre&#8208;catalyst activators permits the utilization of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal pre&#8208;catalysts and avoids the presence of additional activators.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in  Pichia pastoris  at 52 mg.L  &#8208;1  provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride.

Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65% and a perfect control over their size.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing inorganic coordination chemistry by spectroscopy of isolated molecules: methods and applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique feature of the work carried out in the Collaborative Research Center 3MET continues to be its emphasis on innovative, advanced experimental methods which hyphenate mass&#8208;selection with further analytical tools such as laser spectroscopy for the study of  isolated  molecular ions. This allows to probe the intrinsic properties of the species of interest free of perturbing solvent or matrix effects. This review explains these methods and uses examples from past and ongoing 3MET studies of specific classes of multicenter metal complexes to illustrate how coordination chemistry can be advanced by applying them. As a corollary, we will show how the challenges involved in providing well&#8208;defined, e.g. monoisomeric, samples of the molecular ions have helped to further improve the methods themselves thus also making them applicable to many other areas of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>THF&#8208;solvated Heavy Alkali Metal Benzyl Compounds (Na, Rb, Cs): Defined Deprotonation Reagents for Alkali Metal Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heavy alkali metals into substrates is both challenging and essential for many reactions. Here, we report the formation of thf&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds [PhCH  2  M(thf)  n  ] ( M = Na, Rb, Cs). The synthesis was carried out by deprotonation of toluene with the bimetallic mixture n&#8208;butyllithium/alkali metal&#160;tert&#8208;butoxide&#160;and selective crystallization from thf of the defined benzyl compounds. Insights into the molecular structure in the solid as well as in solution state are gained by single crystal X&#8208;ray experiments and NMR spectroscopic studies. The compounds could be successfully used as alkali metal mediating reagents. The example of caesium showed the convenient use by deprotonating acidic C&#8211;H as well as N&#8211;H compounds to gain insight into the aminometalation using these reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe  1&#8208;x  Co  x  O  3  catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost maybe originated from a slower deactivation rate of the Co  3+  sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet and dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.</dc:description>

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reversible Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence color in an acidic environment, which allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Since the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted, simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.</dc:description>
