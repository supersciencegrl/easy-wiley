         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Generation of Oxygenated Quaternary Centers via EnT Enabled Singlet O2 Addition to C3&#8208;Maleimidated Quinoxaline: A Reagent&#8208;Less Approach</title>

A reagent&#8208;less sensitizer&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced access of oxygenated centers via hindered tertiary hydroxylation (Csp3&#8208;H) and intramolecular spiro&#8208;etherification (Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H) of photo&#8208;responsive C3&#8208;maleimidated quinoxaline has been demonstrated. This is an illustrative example of a tautomeric reacting substrate&#8208;induced singlet oxygen up&#8208;taken divergent photo&#8208;oxygenation, guided by the use of a suitable solvent.







Abstract
Demonstrated here is an external photo&#8208;sensitizer&#8208;free (auto&#8208;sensitized) singlet oxygen&#8208;enabled solvent&#8208;dependent tertiary hydroxylation and aryl&#8208;alkyl spiro&#8208;etherification of C3&#8208;maleimidated quinoxalines. Such &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; photo&#8208;oxygenation at Csp3&#8208;H and etherification involving Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H are unparalleled. Possibly, the highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;H tautomer allows the substrate to get excited by irradiation, and subsequently, it attains the triplet state via ISC. This excited triplet&#8208;state sensitized molecule then transfers its energy to a triplet&#8208;state oxygen (3O2) generating reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) for hydroxylation and spirocyclization depending on the solvent used. In HFIP, the generated alkoxy radical accepts a proton via HAT giving hydroxylated product. In contrast, in an aprotic PhCl it underwent a radical addition at the ortho&#8208;position of the C2 aryl to provide spiro&#8208;ether. An unprecedented orthogonal spiro&#8208;etherification was observed via the displacement of o&#8208;substitutents for ortho (&#8722;OEt, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;F, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br) substituted substrates. The order of ipso substitution follows the trend &#8722;OMe&gt;&#8722;OEt&gt;&#8722;F&gt;&#8722;H&gt;&#8722;Cl&gt;&#8722;Br. Both these oxygenation reactions can be carried out with nearly equal ease using direct sunlight without the requirement of any elaborate reaction setup. Demonstration of large&#8208;scale synthesis and a few interesting transformations have also been realized. Furthermore, several insightful control experiments and quantum chemical computations were performed to unravel the mechanism.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of BCL&#8208;2 Targeting PROTACs</title>

BCL&#8208;2 is an antiapoptotic factor that regulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is frequently implicated in haematopoietic cancers. Herein, we report our efforts to develop a BCL&#8208;2 degrader by incorporating either venetoclax or Nap&#8208;1 derivative into chimeric compounds hijacking CRBN, VHL or IAP as the E3 ligase.







Abstract
BCL&#8208;2, a member of the BCL&#8208;2 protein family, is an antiapoptotic factor that regulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Due to its aberrant activity, it is frequently implicated in haematopoietic cancers and represents an attractive target for the development of therapeutics that antagonize its activity. A selective BCL&#8208;2 inhibitor, venetoclax, was approved for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and other haematologic malignancies, validating BCL&#8208;2 as an anticancer target. Since then, alternative therapeutic approaches to modulate the activity of BCL&#8208;2 have been explored, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras. Despite numerous research groups focusing on developing degraders of BCL&#8208;2 family member proteins, selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTACs remain elusive, as disclosed compounds only show dual BCL&#8208;xL/BCL&#8208;2 degradation. Herein, we report our efforts to develop BCL&#8208;2 degraders by incorporating two BCL&#8208;2 binding moieties into chimeric compounds that aim to hijack one of three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and IAPs. Even though our project did not result in obtaining a potent and selective BCL&#8208;2 PROTAC, our research will aid in understanding the narrow chemical space of BCL&#8208;2 degraders.

         <title>Intramolecularly O,N,O&#8208;Coordinated Tin(II) Salts: Syntheses, Structures, Cyclization, and Transition Metal Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>

Pyridine derivatives Ln containing phosphonyl, phosphinyl, carbonic ester, and carbonic amide type substituents in 2,6&#8208;positions induce autoionization of tin(II) halides giving pairs of intramolecularly O,N,O&#8208;coordinated [LnSnX]+ cations and SnX3&#8722; anions. These undergo thermally induced ester cleavage giving Sn(II) heterocycles containing stereogenic centres, and proved suitable as ligands toward W(CO)4.







Abstract
We report the syntheses of tin(II) salts of the types [L1SnX]SnX3 [L1=2,6&#8208;{(i&#8208;PrO)2(O)P}2C5H3N: 1, X=Cl; 2, X=Br], [L2SnCl]SnCl3 [L2=2&#8208;{(i&#8208;PrO)Ph(O)P}&#8208;6&#8208;{(i&#8208;PrO)2(O)P}C5H3N: 3], [L3SnX]SnX3 [L3=2,6&#8208;{MeO(O)C}2C5H3N: 4, X=Cl; 5, X=Br], [L4SnX]SnX3 [L4=2,6&#8208;{Et2N(O)C}2C5H3N: 6, X=Cl; 7, X=Br]. These compounds were obtained by addition of SnX2 to the corresponding ligand inducing autoionization of the respective tin(II) halide. The thermal stability of 1, 3, and 4 was elucidated, giving, under ester cleavage and cyclisation, the tin(II) derivatives 8&#8211;12. The reaction of [L1SnCl]SnCl3 (1) with W(CO)4(thf)2 afforded the tungsten tetracarbonyl complex [{L1SnCl}{SnCl3}W(CO)4] (13), representing the first example in which a tin(II) stannate anion and a tin(II) stannylium cation simultaneously coordinate to a transition metal centre. The compounds were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and in part by elemental analyses, IR and NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. DFT calculations accompany the experimental work.

         <title>Valorization of Corn Straw for Production of Glucose by Two&#8208;Step Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis is applied for selective degradation of corn straw to glucose production. As high as 32.2&#8201;% yield of glucose is achieved without additional catalyst and the active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation on glucose units of cellulose is crucial.







Abstract
Depolymerization of the cellulose part in lignocellulose to glucose is a significant step for lignocellulose valorization. As one of the main by&#8208;products of agricultural biomass in crop&#8208;producing filed, valorization of corn straw has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis was applied for selective depolymerization of the cellulose component of corn straw to glucose production. Most part of the hemicellulose component could be removed through high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8722;H2O pretreatment in the presence of low concentration of acetic acid, and then as high as 32.2&#8201;% yield of glucose was achieved in water at 170&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h without additional catalyst. The active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation of hydroxymethyl groups to carboxyl groups on glucose units of cellulose was shown to be crucial for the efficient valorization of corn straw for glucose production.

         <title>Molecular Packing Topology and Interactions to Decipher Mechanical Compliances in Dicyano&#8208;Distyrylbenzene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular packing and interaction topology of eight crystal systems, including polymorphs, solvate crystal, and isometric charge transfer crystals of dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene derivatives with similar molecular structures but varying structural and interaction characteristics were investigated in detail to explore the key molecular arrangements necessary for mechanical compliance. The results provide an updated explanation for the elastic bending observed in semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystals.







Abstract
Flexible optoelectronics is the need of the hour as the market moves toward wearable and conformable devices. Crystalline &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials offer high performance as active materials compared to their amorphous counterpart, but they are typically brittle. This poses a significant challenge that needs to be overcome to unfold their potential in optoelectronic devices. Unveiling the molecular packing topology and identifying interaction descriptors that can accommodate strain offers essential guiding principles for developing conjugated materials as active components in flexible optoelectronics. The molecular packing and interaction topology of eight crystal systems of dicyano&#8208;distyrylbenzene derivatives are investigated. Face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacks in an inclined orientation relative to the bending surface can accommodate expansion and compression with minimal molecular motion from their equilibrium positions. This configuration exhibits good compliance towards mechanical strain, while a similar structure with a criss&#8208;cross arrangement capable of distributing applied strain equally in opposite directions enhances the flexibility. Molecular arrangements that cannot reversibly undergo expansion and compression exhibit brittleness. In the isometric CT crystals, the disproportionate strength of the interactions along the bending plane and orthogonal directions makes these materials sustain a moderate bending strain. These results provide an updated explanation for the elastic bending in semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystals.

         <title>Thermally Stable P&#8208;Chiral Supramolecular Phosphines, their Self&#8208;Assembly and Implication in Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines with enantiomeric excess of up to 99&#8201;% is reported. These phosphines are stable up to 150&#8201;&#176;C and can be handled in air for a few hours. They can self&#8208;assemble on metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh to produce chiral catalysts. The self&#8208;assembled Rh&#8208;complex catalyzes the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes to yield chiral compound with an ee of 99&#8201;% and near quantitative conversion.







Abstract
P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one&#8208;step synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)&#8208;QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd&#8208;2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd&#8208;2 catalyzed a direct P&#8722;C coupling of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;iodophenyl)urea (B1)/2&#8208;iodo /6&#8208;hydroxy pyridine (B2) and,produced corresponding ligands L1&#8211;L3. The P&#8722;C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phosphindol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99&#8201;%. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24&#8197;hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self&#8208;assembled and produced L2&#8722;C1 (Pt), L2&#8722;C2(Pd), and L2&#8722;C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self&#8208;assembled P&#8208;chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins. The L2&#8722;C3 catalyzed AH of functionalized alkenes and delivered chiral products with excellent enantioselectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. A small library of 16 substrates was subjected to AH using L2&#8722;C3 to produce chiral compounds with excellent conversion and ee.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Selective Sialyllactose&#8208;Imprinted Nanogels</title>

Three different monomers were explored for the synthesis of imprinted nanogels targeting &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. A bottom&#8208;up platform including NMR spectroscopy, ARS titration, in silico studies and Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis provides a ranking and leads to the best material in terms of affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
We describe a facile method to prepare water&#8208;compatible molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP NGs) as synthetic antibodies against target glycans. Three different phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives were explored as monomers for the synthesis of MIP NGs targeting either &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. Starting from commercially available 3&#8208;acrylamidophenylboronic acid, also its 2&#8208;substituted isomer and the 5&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxymethyl cyclic PBA monoester derivative were initially evaluated by NMR studies. Then, a small library of MIP NGs imprinted with the &#945;2,6&#8208;linked template was synthesized and tested by mobility shift Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (msACE), to rapidly assess an affinity ranking. Finally, the best monomer 2&#8208;acrylamido PBA was selected for the synthesis of polymers targeting both sialyllactoses. The resulting MIP NGs display an affinity constant&#8776;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and selectivity towards imprinted glycans. This general procedure could be applied to any non&#8208;modified carbohydrate template possessing a reducing end.

         <title>Azopyridinium Ionic Photoswitches: Tuning Half&#8208;Lives of Z Isomers from Seconds to Days in Water</title>

         <dc:description>
We present the design and synthesis of water&#8208;soluble heteroaryl azopyridinium ionic photoswitches (HAPIPs). The variations in the substituents of the five&#8208;membered heterocycle part, counterions, and solvent medium allow us to tune the Z isomer stability from seconds to days.







Abstract
Herein, we describe water&#8208;soluble heteroaryl azopyridinium ionic photoswitches (HAPIPs). We aim to combine variations in five&#8208;membered heterocycles, their substitutions, N&#8208;alkyl groups at pyridinium nitrogen, the position of pyridinium center relative to azo group, counterions, and solvents, in achieving better photoswitching. Through these studies, we successfully tuned the half&#8208;life of Z isomers of the resultant HAPIPs between seconds to days in water. Extensive spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations unravelled the factors responsible for thermal relaxation behavior. Considering the versatility of these photoswitches, the tunability of half&#8208;lives and photoswitching in aqueous medium allows the scope of applications in several fields.

         <title>Targeting Manganese Amidinate and &#223;&#8208;Ketoiminate Complexes as Precursors for Mn&#8208;Based Thin Film Deposition</title>

Exploring new manganese complexes bearing all nitrogen coordinated and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated ligand systems revealed very interesting insights on the structure&#8208;property relationship. A comprehensive investigation on the physico&#8208;chemical properties alongside DFT experiments has identified potential precursors for chemical vapor deposition processing of Mn containing thin films.







Abstract
With a focus on Mn based organometallic compounds with suitable physico&#8208;chemical properties to serve as precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Mn&#8208;containing materials, systematic synthetic approaches with ligand variation, detailed characterization, and theoretical input from density functional theory (DFT) studies are presented. A series of new homoleptic all&#8208;nitrogen and mixed oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn(II) complexes bearing the acetamidinate, formamidinate, guanidinate and &#223;&#8208;ketoiminate ligands have been successfully synthesized for the first time. The specific choice of these ligand classes with changes in structure and coordination sphere and side chain variations result in significant structural differences whereby mononuclear and dinuclear complexes are formed. This was supported by density functional theory (DFT) studies. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. To evaluate their suitability as precursors for deposition of Mn&#8208;based materials, the thermal properties were investigated in detail. Mn(II) complexes possessing the most promising thermal properties, namely Bis(N,N&#8217;&#8208;ditertbutylformamidinato)manganese(II) (IV) and Bis(4&#8208;(isopropylamino)pent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;onato)manganese(II) (&#223;III) were used in reactivity studies with DFT to explore their interaction with oxidizing co&#8208;reactants such as oxygen and water which will guide future CVD and ALD process development.

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Olefins Activated on Highly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Calcium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>

Readily available salt of Ca2+ with weakly coordinating anion [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) exhibits high Lewis acidity comparable to SbF5. Reactivity studies show it is an effective catalyst for olefin hydrosilylation, yielding anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioisomer. Experimental and DFT studies indicate a unique mechanism for this type of reaction, which involves the activation of the olefin molecule by coordination with Ca2+.







Abstract
The report introduces simple yet highly reactive calcium salt, Ca[Al(ORF)4]2 (RF=C(CF3)3), 1, which effectively catalyses olefin hydrosilylation through an unusual mechanism involving the activation of the alkene molecule. Upon dissolution in o&#8208;difluorobenzene (oDFB), 1 forms a highly Lewis acidic [Ca(oDFB)6]2+ complex. Our DFT calculations reveal that fluoride ion affinity is comparable to SbF5. Reactivity tests show that it effectively catalyses the hydrosilylation of olefins with high regioselectivity, also in reactions involving sterically demanding substrates like (iPr)3SiH or tetrasubstituted olefins. Experimental and computational results point to the mechanism where the olefin molecule forms a complex with Ca2+, which significantly facilitates the attack of H&#8208;SiR3 on the C=C double bond.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide by Confinement of Cobalt Porphyrins in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt porphyrin was confined in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) leading to highly selective oxygen reduction towards H2O2. Moreover, the confinement led to a high stability during the electrochemical production and buildup of H2O2 for at least 5&#8197;h. Overall, this work shows that the use of MOFs to confine molecular complexes as single&#8208;site catalysts is an effective tool to enhance the stability and selectivity for electrochemical conversions.







Abstract
Sustainable alternatives for the energy intensive synthesis of H2O2 are necessary. Molecular cobalt catalysts show potential but are typically restricted by undesired bimolecular pathways leading to the breakdown of both H2O2 and the catalyst. The confinement of cobalt porphyrins in the PCN&#8208;224 metal&#8208;organic framework leads to an enhanced selectivity towards H2O2 and stability of the catalyst. Consequently, oxygen can now be selectively reduced to hydrogen peroxide with a stable conversion for at least 5&#8197;h, illustrating the potential of catalysts confined in MOFs to increase the selectivity and stability of electrocatalytic conversions.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Cyclic Trimer of a Chiral Spirosilabifluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a spirosilabifluorene cyclic trimer have been successfully demonstrated. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were decreased through the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties were investigated from both experimental and theoretical points of view with careful discussion.







Abstract
A chiral shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic compound (Si&#8208;[3]), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (C&#8208;[3]), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro&#8208;conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound Si&#8208;[3] was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of Si&#8208;[3]. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of Si&#8208;[3] with D3&#8208;symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (P,P,P)&#8208;Si&#8208;[3] showed a high emission quantum yield (&#934;f=80&#8201;%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (glum,exp=&#8722;1.2&#215;10&#8722;3). According to the time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from Si&#8208;[3] was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully&#8208;allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of &#964;f=1.89&#8197;ns.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterization of a spirosilabifluorene cyclic trimer have been successfully demonstrated. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were decreased through the C/Si substitution in the spiro-atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties were investigated from both experimental and theoretical points of view with careful discussion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral shape-persistent macrocyclic compound (&lt;b&gt;Si-[3]&lt;/b&gt;), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro-atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (&lt;b&gt;C-[3]&lt;/b&gt;), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro-conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound &lt;b&gt;Si-[3]&lt;/b&gt; was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of &lt;b&gt;Si-[3]&lt;/b&gt;. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of &lt;b&gt;Si-[3]&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;Si-[3]&lt;/b&gt; showed a high emission quantum yield (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;=80&#8201;%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum,exp&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;1.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). According to the time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from &lt;b&gt;Si-[3]&lt;/b&gt; was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully-allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;=1.89&#8197;ns.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Ultrapotent Tricyclic Ligands for FK506&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rigid, sp3&#8208;rich tricyclic scaffold has been designed as a module for the development of FKBP small molecule ligands and molecular glues. Structure&#8208;based design enabled the synthesized scaffold to precisely lock all functional groups for the optimal interaction with the protein target. Upon structural optimization, a dramatic improvement in cellular activity is observed for the substituted tricyclic FKBP ligands.







Abstract
Access to small, rigid, and sp3&#8208;rich molecules is a major limitation in the drug discovery for challenging protein targets. FK506&#8208;binding proteins hold high potential as drug targets or enablers of molecular glues but are fastidious in the chemotypes accepted as ligands. We here report an enantioselective synthesis of a highly rigidified pipecolate&#8208;mimicking tricyclic scaffold that precisely positions functional groups for interacting with FKBPs. This was enabled by a 14&#8208;step gram&#8208;scale synthesis featuring anodic oxidation, stereospecific vinylation, and N&#8208;acyl iminium cyclization. Structure&#8208;based optimization resulted in the discovery of FKBP inhibitors with picomolar biochemical and subnanomolar cellular activity that represent the most potent FKBP ligands known to date.

         <title>Electrophilic Behavior of the &#8220;Nucleophilic&#8221; Pyramidane: Reactivity of Ge&#8208;Pyramidane towards Organolithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of Ge&#8208;pyramidane with tBuLi produces an unusual organogermanium compound featuring a Ge&#8722;Li bond and additional &#951;3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;coordination of lithium cation to C3&#8208;allylic moiety of the carbon base, as the product of the formal insertion of a Ge&#8208;apex into the C&#8722;Li bond of tBuLi, thus portraying unique electrophilic behavior of a pyramidane.







Abstract
The particular reactivity of the recently discovered class of the main group element polyhedral clusters, pyramidanes, remains largely unexplored. In this communication, we report the reaction of the germapyramidane with tert&#8208;butyllithium leading to the rather unusual organogermanium compound [Li+(thf)2]&#8901;2&#8722;, as the product of the formal insertion of a Ge&#8208;apex into the C&#8722;Li bond. This reactivity mode exemplifies unusual electrophilic behaviour of a pyramidane, which is a priori considered as a nucleophilic reagent. Being highly reactive, [Li+(thf)2]&#8901;2&#8722; readily undergoes reactions with electrophiles (MeI, EtBr), initially forming intermediate germahousenes, which isomerize to the thermodynamically more favourable germoles.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Kekulene Analogues: Cycloarenes with two Five&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bowl&#8208;shaped cycloarene have been synthesized via the introduction of five&#8208;membered rings into the kekulene structure. The results of DFT calculations and VT&#8208;NMR spectra indicate that inversion of concave&#8208;convex structures occurs at room temperature. Additionally, these compounds react with a dienophile to produce the vent structure compounds.







Abstract
Kekulene, a cycloarene composed of 12 fused benzene rings in a circular arrangement, exhibits a highly planar and robust structure. Kekulene has been the subject of investigation into its aromaticity and electronic structure, particularly in relation to the cyclic benzenoid. We have successfully synthesized novel bowl&#8208;shaped kekulene analogues with five&#8208;membered rings incorporated into the kekulene structure. The results of DFT calculations and VT&#8208;NMR spectra indicate that inversion of their concave&#8208;convex structures occurs at room temperature. The NICS and AICD plots predict that the Clar's type resonance structure is found in a manner analogous to the pristine kekulene, albeit with the interruption of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation on the sp3 carbons at the five&#8208;membered rings. Despite the presence of the Clar's resonance structure, the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction proceeded smoothly with a dienophile, in contrast to the behavior of planar kekulene derivatives. This study will lead to the creation of novel bowl&#8208;shaped compounds and development of reactivity in aromatic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Asymmetric Ionic Hybrid Detergents enables Micelles with Scalable Properties including Cell Compatibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric modularity is the new kid on the block that drives the diversification of the detergentome. Modular ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents deliver a new chemical space and design modalities to switch ionic detergent species toxic to cells from monomers to mixtures of monomers and micellar assemblies.







Abstract
Ionic detergents enable applications and cause harm in biospheres due to cell toxicity. The utility of covalent combinations between ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergent headgroups in modulating cell toxicity remains speculative due to the yet rarely explored synthesis. We close this gap and establish the modular synthesis of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. We restructure a combinatorial methallyl dichloride one&#8208;pot coupling into a two&#8208;step coupling, which reduces by&#8208;products, improves product yields, and enables the gram&#8208;scale preparation of asymmetric, cationic/non&#8208;ionic and anionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents. Our modular synthesis delivers new modalities for the design of ionic detergents, including an unprecedented scaling of properties that determine applications, such as charge, critical micelle concentration, solubilizing properties, hard water tolerance, and cell compatibility. We uncover that shielding the charge in ionic headgroups can switch the detergent species that is toxic to cells from monomers to mixtures of monomers and micellar assemblies. Establishing the chemistry of ionic/non&#8208;ionic hybrid detergents provides a missing evolutionary link in the structural comparison of ionic and non&#8208;ionic detergents, enables an easy synthesis access to yet unexplored chemical spaces of asymmetric hybrid materials, and delivers new modalities for designing the toxicity of supramolecular nanomaterials.

         <title>Arylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole Derivatives: Molecular Probes Exhibiting Reversible Light&#8208;induced Phase Transitions for Energy Storage and Direct Photolithographic Patterning</title>

Three&#8208;in&#8208;one: Azo&#8208;3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole derivatives with a long half&#8208;life of Z isomer exhibiting light&#8208;induced phase transition behaviour and possessing excellent energy storage and release characteristics over a wider temperature range and showing photolithography applications.







Abstract
We report azopyrazole photoswitches decorated with variable N&#8208;alkyl and alkoxy chains (for hydrophobic interactions) and phenyl substituents on the pyrazoles (enabling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking), showing efficient bidirectional photoswitching and reversible light&#8208;induced phase transition (LIPT). Extensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and diffraction studies and computations confirmed the manifestation of molecular&#8208;level interactions and photoisomerization into macroscopic changes leading to the LIPT phenomena. Using differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies, the energetics associated with those accompanying processes were estimated. The long half&#8208;lives of Z isomers, high energy contents for isomerization and phase transitions, and the stability of phases over an extended temperature range (&#8722;60 to 80&#8201;&#176;C) make them excellent candidates for energy storage and release applications. Remarkably, the difference in the solubility of the distinct phases in one of the derivatives allowed us to utilize it as a photoresist in photolithography applications on diverse substrates.

         <title>Probing the Electron Accepting Ability of Phosphaphenalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron accepting ability of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide was systematically investigated by chemical and electrochemical methods as well as computational studies. Chemical reduction of phosphaphenalene by alkali metals leads to the formation of phosphaphenalenide anion. The successive reduction of pentavalent P&#8208;oxide gives rise to radical anion and dianion salts.







Abstract
Phosphaphenalenes, extended &#960; conjugates with the incorporation of phosphorus, are attractive avenues towards molecular materials for the applications in organic electronics, but their electron accepting ability have not been investigated. Herein we present systematic studies on the reductive behavior of a representative phosphaphenalene and its oxide by chemical and electrochemical methods. The chemical reduction of the phosphaphenalene by alkali metals reveals the facile P&#8722;C bond cleavage to form phosphaphenalenide anion, which functions as a transfer block for structure modification on the phosphorus atom. In contrast, the pentavalent P&#8208;oxide reacts with one or two equivalents of elemental sodium to form stable radical anion and dianion salts, respectively.

         <title>Crystal to Hydrogel Transformation in S&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;Cysteine&#8208;Containing Cyclic Dipeptides &#8208; Nanostructure Elucidation and Applications</title>

S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine derived cyclic dipeptides containing different amino acid partners produce self&#8208;assembled structures, and their hydrogelation propensities are highly governed by the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains. The hydrogels produced by the cyclic dipeptides are thermoreversible, thixotropic, and have the ability to remove toxic dyes from contaminated water.







Abstract
Cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are crucial building blocks for a range of functional nanomaterials due to their simple chemical structure and high molecular stability. In this investigation, we synthesized a set of S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine&#8208;based CDPs (designated as P1&#8208;P6) and thoroughly examined their self&#8208;assembly behavior in a methanol&#8208;water solvent to elucidate the relationship between their structure and gelation properties. The hydrophobicity of the amino acids within the CDPs was gradually increased. The present study employed a comprehensive array of analytical techniques, including NMR, FT&#8208;IR, AFM, thioflavin&#8208;T, congo&#8208;red CD, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and biophysical calculations like Hirshfield Surface analysis and DFT analysis. These methods revealed that in addition to hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid side chain significantly influences the propensity of CDPs to form hydrogels. Each CDP yielded distinct nanofibrillar networks rich in &#946;&#8208;sheet structures, showcasing unique morphological features. Moreover, we explored the practical application of these CDP&#8208;based hydrogels in water purification by utilizing them to remove harmful organic dyes from contaminated water. This application underscores the potential of CDPs in addressing environmental challenges, offering a promising avenue for the future development of these materials in water treatment technologies.

         <title>Modulating Heavy Atom Effect in Germylene for Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CzGe and its derivatives CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu are a series of low&#8208;valent germylene&#8208;based pRTP molecules in which CzGe exhibits an unprecedented orange afterglow with an utralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and a high quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, resulting from a balanced ISC and HAE that has been confirmed by experimental observation and theoretical calculation.







Abstract
Abstract: It is worth but still challenging to develop the low&#8208;valent main group compounds with persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP). Herein, we presented germylene&#8208;based persistent phosphors by introduction of low&#8208;valent Ge center into chromophore. A novel phosphors CzGe and its series of derivatives, namely CzGeS, CzGeSe, CzGeAu, and CzGeCu, were synthesized. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the pRTP behavior were &#8220;turn on&#8221; due to the heavy atom effect of germylene. More importantly, the low&#8208;valent of oxidation state and structural traits propelled GeCz had a balance between the intersystem crossing and the shortening of lifetime caused by the heavy atoms, resulting the ultralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and phosphorescent quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, which is remarkable among heavy main group phosphors. This research provides valuable insights to the design of heavy atoms in phosphors and expand the applications of germylene chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CzGe&lt;/b&gt; and its derivatives &lt;b&gt;CzGeS&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeSe&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeAu&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;CzGeCu&lt;/b&gt; are a series of low-valent germylene-based pRTP molecules in which &lt;b&gt;CzGe&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an unprecedented orange afterglow with an utralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and a high quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, resulting from a balanced ISC and HAE that has been confirmed by experimental observation and theoretical calculation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;: It is worth but still challenging to develop the low-valent main group compounds with persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP). Herein, we presented germylene-based persistent phosphors by introduction of low-valent Ge center into chromophore. A novel phosphors &lt;b&gt;CzGe&lt;/b&gt; and its series of derivatives, namely &lt;b&gt;CzGeS&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeSe&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;CzGeAu&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;CzGeCu&lt;/b&gt;, were synthesized. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the pRTP behavior were &#8220;turn on&#8221; due to the heavy atom effect of germylene. More importantly, the low-valent of oxidation state and structural traits propelled &lt;b&gt;GeCz&lt;/b&gt; had a balance between the intersystem crossing and the shortening of lifetime caused by the heavy atoms, resulting the ultralong lifetime of 309&#8197;ms and phosphorescent quantum efficiency of 15.84&#8201;%, which is remarkable among heavy main group phosphors. This research provides valuable insights to the design of heavy atoms in phosphors and expand the applications of germylene chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis on the Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction of Aminochalcone: Catalytic Performance and Chalcogen Bond Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several mono&#8208;/bis&#8208;dentate hypervalent chalcogen bond donors were applied to catalyze the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The electron density of the chalcogen bond, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8722;N bond coupling process and can be used to predict the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis, as a new type in the field of non&#8208;covalent bond catalysis, has become a hot research topic in the field of organocatalysis in recent years. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a series of hypervalent ChB catalysis based on the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The reaction includes the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond coupling step (key step) and the proton transfer step. The catalytic performance of mono&#8208;dentate pentafluorophenyl chalcogen bond donor ChB1 was comparable to that of bis&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donor ChB4, and stronger than that of mono&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donors ChB2 and ChB3. The formation of the chalcogen bond between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the reactant, causing the charge rearrangement of the reactant and C(1) charge of the &#8722;C&#8722;Ph group to become more positive, thereby the ChB catalysis promoted the nucleophile reaction. The electron density of the chalcogen bond of the pre&#8208;complex, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8722;N bond coupling process, which provides an idea to predict the catalytic activity of the ChB catalysis.

         <title>Backbone Modification in a Protein Hydrophobic Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted backbone alteration is a powerful strategy for the design of protein mimetic macromolecules. The present work demonstrates artificial chain connectivity can be accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a complex tertiary fold with minimal impact on folded structure or folded stability.







Abstract
Targeted protein backbone modification can recreate tertiary structures reminiscent of folds found in nature on artificial scaffolds with improved biostability. Incorporation of altered monomers in such entities is typically limited to sites distant from the hydrophobic core to avoid potential disruptions to folding. This is limiting, as it is advantageous in some applications to incorporate artificial connectivity at buried sites. Here, we report an examination of protein backbone modification targeted specifically to hydrophobic core positions and its impacts on tertiary folded structure and fold stability. Different artificial monomer types are placed at core, core&#8208;flanking, or solvent&#8208;exposed positions in a compact three&#8208;helix protein. Effects on structure and folding energetics are assessed by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. Results show that artificial residues can be well accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a defined tertiary fold, with effects on stability only modestly larger than identical changes at solvent&#8208;exposed sites. Collectively, these results provide new insights into folding behavior of protein&#8208;like artificial chains as well as strategies for the design of such molecules.

Herein, we report the design and synthesis and a fluorescence study of water&#8208;soluble benzo&#8208;crown ether substituted O&#8208;BODIPY dyes towards their fluorometric recognition behavior of cations. The benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 equipped O&#8208;BODIPY shows a high affinity to Ba2+ enhanced water solubility and appropriate selectivity for detection of Ba2+ in the presence of other cations (cf. TOC).







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and sensing characteristics of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted BODIPY fluorescent probes (O&#8208;BODIPYs) 3, 4 and 5 equipped with differently sized benzo&#8208;crown ethers (cf. Scheme&#8197;1, 3 (benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5), 4 (benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) and 5 (benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown7)). O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 exhibited in comparison to their known F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a (cf. Scheme&#8197;1) an improved solubility in aqueous medium and higher fluorescence quantum yields. Fluorometric study in aqueous solutions of 3, 4 and 5 in the presence of different cations show cation induced fluorescence enhancements (FE). Compared to the benzo&#8208;crown ether substituted F&#8208;BODIPY analogues 3a, 4a and 5a, we found for the free O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 higher fluorescence quantum yields (&#966;f) but lower cation induced FEs. We show that in aqueous medium the fluorescence quenching process (OFF switching), a photoinduced electron transfer, in O&#8208;BODIPYs 3, 4 and 5 is less effective and consequently sensitive and selective ON switching of the fluorescence by cations, too. Albeit these observations the novel benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 equipped fluorescent probe 5 exhibits a good fluorometric Ba2+ selectivity and Ba2+ sensitivity in conjunction to their aqueous solubility.

         <title>A Practical and Modular Method for Direct C&#8722;H Functionalization of the BODIPY Core via Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and modular photochemical method for the direct C&#8722;H functionalization of the BODIPY core with versatile thianthrenium salts to prepare diverse aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY dyes was developed. This mild protocol proceeds with high site&#8208;selectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance, and enabled the synthesis of sophisticated disubstituted BODIPY dyes and the late&#8208;stage BODIPY modification of complex drug molecules.







Abstract
Direct structural modification of small&#8208;molecule fluorophores represents a straightforward and appealing strategy for accessing new fluorescent dyes with desired functionalities. We report herein a general and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated method for the direct C&#8722;H functionalization of BODIPY, an important fluorescent chromophore, using readily accessible and bench&#8208;stable aryl and alkenylthianthrenium salts. This practical approach operates at room temperature with extraordinary site&#8208;selectivity, providing a step&#8208;economical means to construct various valuable aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY dyes. Remarkably, this protocol encompasses a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, and allows for the modular synthesis of sophisticated symmetrical and asymmetrical disubstituted BODIPYs by simply employing different combinations of thianthrenium salts. Moreover, the late&#8208;stage BODIPY modification of complex drug molecules further highlights the potential of this novel methodology in the synthesis of fluorophore&#8208;drug conjugates.

We report herein a general and efficient visible-light-mediated method for the direct C&#8722;H functionalization of BODIPY, an important fluorescent chromophore, using readily accessible and bench-stable aryl and alkenylthianthrenium salts. This practical approach operates at room temperature with extraordinary site-selectivity, providing a step-economical means to construct various valuable aryl- and alkenyl-substituted BODIPY dyes. Remarkably, this protocol encompasses a broad substrate scope and excellent functional-group tolerance, and allows for the modular synthesis of sophisticated symmetrical and asymmetrical disubstituted BODIPYs by simply employing different combinations of thianthrenium salts. Moreover, the late-stage BODIPY modification of complex drug molecules further highlights the potential of this novel methodology in the synthesis of fluorophore-drug conjugates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mausolates: Large&#8208;Cavity Chelates with Potential as Delivery Vehicles in Nuclear Medicine

Despite their long and illustrious history as ligands in inorganic chemistry, no cage complexes based on tris(pyrazolyl)borate units are known. We describe herein the facile synthesis of exceptionally stable nonadentate mausolate cages based on this unit and demonstrate their rapid uptake of lanthanide ions from dilute solution. The large cavity makes mausolates extremely appealing as delivery agents for large radionuclides in nuclear medicine.







Abstract
A new type of diborate clathrochelate (cage) ligand featuring nine inwardly pointing nitrogen donors that form a large, rigid cavity, termed a mausolate, is presented. The cavity size and high denticity make this an attractive delivery vehicle for large radionuclides in nuclear medicine. Metal mausolate complexes are stable to air and water (neutral pH) and display extremely high thermal stability (&gt;400&#8201;&#176;C). Lanthanide uptake by the mausolate ligand occurs rapidly in solution at room temperature and once complexed, the lanthanide ions are not displaced by a 250&#8208;fold excess of a competitive lanthanide salt over more than one week.

The triflimide&#8208;directed C(Sp2)&#8208;H functionalization of N&#8208;benzyltriflamide with maleimide followed by hydrolysis of in&#8197;situ generated imine is reported using ruthenium catalysis. It offers the synthesis of various synthetically useful o&#8208;succinimide derivatives of benzaldehydes in good to excellent yields. The detailed mechanistic studies and competitive experiments prove the versatility of our developed method.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;benzyltriflamide assisted C&#8722;H alkylation with maleimide followed by hydrolysis of in&#8197;situ generated imine has been developed for the first time. This synthetic method results in the efficient synthesis of o&#8208;succinimide derivatives of benzaldehydes.

The incorrect IUPAC name makes the carbon atom hexavalent at two different places and misplaces the carbonyl groups in two other places.







Abstract
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name given in the title is incorrect. The correct IUPAC name for this molecule is tetraspiro[2.1.25.1.29.1.213.13]hexadecane&#8208;4,8,12,16&#8208;tetraone. The incorrect name given in the title, unfortunately, makes the carbon atom hexavalent at two different (3 and 5) positions. In addition, the two other keto groups (at positions 1 and 7) would appear on two of the cyclopropane rings if one adopts to the incorrect name. Nevertheless, this wrong name is a good example to discuss the importance of IUPAC nomenclature in the classroom with students.

The molecular structure of the cyclic trimer of a chiral spirosilabifluorene is shown with blue spheres representing the spiro&#8208;silicon atoms. This molecule was designed by substituting the spiro&#8208;atoms of our previous spiro&#8208;carbon analogues (shown in pink in the background) with silicon. The tail of a comet travelling through space below the molecular structures symbolizes the evolution of the molecular design. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Amaya and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401343).

         <title>Cover Feature: Hydrosilylation of Olefins Activated on Highly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Calcium Cation (Chem. Eur. J. 45/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple calcium cation solvated with o&#8208;C6H4F2 molecules is an efficient catalyst of olefin hydrosilylation. In contrast to currently established mechanisms of the reaction, it is the olefin, not silane, that is activated by coordination to Lewis&#8208;acidic Ca2+, thereby facilitating the attack of hydridic H&#948;&#8722;Si on the C=C bond.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A simple calcium cation&lt;/b&gt; solvated with &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules is an efficient catalyst of olefin hydrosilylation. In contrast to currently established mechanisms of the reaction, it is the olefin, not silane, that is activated by coordination to Lewis-acidic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby facilitating the attack of hydridic H&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Si on the C=C bond.

         <dc:description>
The hydrophobic core of a protein, made up of side chains buried away from water in the folded state, is a crucial element of protein structure. New results show that artificial backbone connectivity can be accommodated in the core of a tertiary fold with minimal impact on folded structure or stability.

         <dc:description>
While targeting new metalorganic precursors for chemical vapor deposition of Mn&#8208;based thin&#8208;film materials, the choice of all&#8208;nitrogen and mixed oxygen&#8211;nitrogen coordinated ligands yielded volatile, reactive and thermally stable Mn precursors. Experimental findings on the structure and reactivity of the new Mn complexes towards co&#8208;reactants were supported by density functional theory calculations. The cover features a simplified energy diagram for two representative Mn complexes and illustrates the interaction energy levels of MnII compounds with oxygen.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies to Extended Aromatic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 45, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), including incorporation of &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks, &#960;&#8208;conjugation through highly conjugated linkages, as well as post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) strategies. Various approaches of growing films of such structures are also presented.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated materials are highly attractive owing to their unique optical and electronic properties. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a great opportunity for precise arrangement of building units in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline matrix and tuning of the properties through choice of functionalities or post&#8208;synthetic modification. With this review, we aim at summarizing both the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs. We give examples of direct synthesis using large, &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks. COFs featuring fully conjugated linkages such as vinylene, pyrazine, and azole are discussed. Then, post&#8208;synthetic modification methods that result in the extension of the COF &#960;&#8208;system are reviewed. Throughout, mechanistic insights are presented when available. In the context of their utilization as film devices, we conduct a concise survey of the prominent COF layer deposition techniques reported and their aptness for the deposition of fused aromatic systems.

         <title>Revisiting the Mechanism of Asymmetric Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation with CO2: The Additives Affect the Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT methods were used to revisit the mechanism of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. Our results indicate that zinc salts can alter the product selectivity, whereas Mg(II) and Li(I) salts activate CO2 during C&#8722;CO2 bond formation.







Abstract
The mechanistic details of the asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization/carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 have been revisited using DFT methods. Emphasis was put on the enantioselectivity and the mechanistic role of Lewis acid additives and in&#8197;situ formed salts. Our results show that oxidative addition of the substrate is rate&#8208;limiting, with the formed Ni(II)&#8208;aryl intermediate preferring a triplet spin state. After reduction to Ni(I), enantioselective cyclization of the substrate occurs, followed by inner sphere carboxylation. Our proposed mechanism reproduces the experimentally observed enantiomeric excess and identifies critical C&#8722;H/O and C&#8722;H/N interactions that affect the selectivity. Further, our results highlight the beneficial effect of Lewis acids on CO2 insertion and suggest that in&#8197;situ formed salts influence if the 5&#8208;exo or 6&#8208;endo product will be formed.

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reaction via Vinylidene Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs with emphasis on methodology innovation and mechanistic rationale is summarized. The remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area are also presented.







Abstract
Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been proven to be versatile and crucial intermediates in the catalytic asymmetric reaction in last decade, and thus have drawn considerable concentrations on account of the practical application in the construction of enantiomerically pure functional organic molecules. However, in comparison to the well established chiral Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs, chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction is rarely studied and there is no systematic summary to date. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs according to three types of reactions: a) intermolecular asymmetric nucleophilic addition to VQMs; b) intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition of VQMs; c) intramolecular asymmetric cyclization of VQMs. Finally, we put forward the remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area.

         <title>Redox Behaviour and Redox Potentials of Dyes in Aqueous Buffers and Protic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active protic ionic liquids hold promise as low&#8208;cost, high energy density electrolytes for redox flow batteries. Their redox behaviour is similar to parent salts in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous buffer, although they may undergo different side reactions. In this work, fortuitous side&#8208;reactions yield quinone&#8208;imines which display promising electrochemistry for flow battery applications.







Abstract
Organic dyes hold promise as inexpensive electrochemically&#8208;active building blocks for new renewable energy technologies such as redox&#8208;flow batteries and dye&#8208;sensitised solar cells, especially if they display high oxidation and/or low reduction potentials in cheap, non&#8208;flammable solvents such as water or protic ionic liquids. Systematic computational and experimental characterisation of a representative selection of acidic and basic dyes in buffered aqueous solutions and propylammonium formate confirm that quinoid&#8208;type mechanisms impart electrochemical reversibility for the majority of systems investigated, including quinones, fused tricyclic heteroaromatics, indigo carmine and some aromatic nitrogenous species. Conversely, systems that generate longlived radical intermediates &#8211; arylmethanes, hydroquinones at high pH, azocyclic systems &#8211; tend to display irreversible electrochemistry, likely undergoing ring&#8208;opening, dimerisation and/or disproportionation reactions.

         <title>Improving Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations for Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces with Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have summarized the evolution of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), introduced some interesting examples applied at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces, and finally posed some prospects for the current challenge of MLIPs.







Abstract
Emerging developments in artificial intelligence have opened infinite possibilities for material simulation. Depending on the powerful fitting of machine learning algorithms to first&#8208;principles data, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can effectively balance the accuracy and efficiency problems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, serving as powerful tools in various complex physicochemical systems. Consequently, this brings unprecedented enthusiasm for researchers to apply such novel technology in multiple fields to revisit the major scientific problems that have remained controversial owing to the limitations of previous computational methods. Herein, we introduce the evolution of MLIPs, provide valuable application examples for solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and present current challenges. Driven by solving multitudinous difficulties in terms of the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of MLIPs, this booming technique, combined with molecular simulation methods, will provide an underlying and valuable understanding of interdisciplinary scientific challenges, including materials, physics, and chemistry.

         <title>In Situ Generation and High Bioresistance of Trityl&#8208;based Semiquinone Methide Radicals Under Anaerobic Conditions in Cellular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ quantitative generation of trityl&#8208;based semiquinone methide radical OXQM&#8901; in cellular systems has been achieved from the quinone methide OXQM under anaerobic conditions. OXQM&#8901; with an EPR single line signal at physiological pH exhibits unprecedented high stability against bioreduction and thus shows great application potential in in&#8208;cell magnetic resonance&#8208;related techniques.







Abstract
Bioreduction of spin labels and polarizing agents (generally stable radicals) has been an obstacle limiting the in&#8208;cell applications of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In this work, we have demonstrated that two semiquinone methide radicals (OXQM&#8901; and CTQM&#8901;) can be easily produced from the trityl&#8208;based quinone methides (OXQM and CTQM) via reduction by various reducing agents including biothiols and ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. Both radicals have relatively low pKa's and exhibit EPR single line signals at physiological pH. Moreover, the bioreduction of OXQM in three cell lysates enables quantitative generation of OXQM&#8901; which was most likely mediated by flavoenzymes. Importantly, the resulting OXQM&#8901; exhibited extremely high stability in the E.coli lysate under anaerobic conditions with 76&#8208; and 14.3&#8208;fold slower decay kinetics as compared to the trityl OX063 and a gem&#8208;diethyl pyrrolidine nitroxide, respectively. Intracellular delivery of OXQM into HeLa cells was also achieved by covalent conjugation with a cell&#8208;permeable peptide as evidenced by the stable intracellular EPR signal from the OXQM&#8901; moiety. Owing to extremely high resistance of OXQM&#8901; towards bioreduction, OXQM and its derivatives show great application potential in in&#8208;cell EPR and in&#8208;cell DNP studies for various cells which can endure short&#8208;term anoxic treatments.

         <title>ABNOH&#8208;Linked Nucleotides and DNA for Bioconjugation and Cross&#8208;linking with Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive probes based on ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides, oligonucleotides or DNA were designed and synthesized for specific cross&#8208;linking and bioconjugation with tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides and proteins.







Abstract
Reactive N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (ABNOH) linked 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC reaction of ABNOH&#8208;PEG4&#8208;N3 with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The modified triphosphate was used as substrate for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The keto&#8208;ABNO radical reacted with tryptophan (Trp) and Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable tricyclic fused hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;indole conjugates. Similarly modified ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable conjugate in the presence but surprisingly even in the absence of NaNO2 (presumably through activation by O2). The reactive ABNOH&#8208;modified DNA probe was used for bioconjugations and crosslinking with Trp&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.

         <title>Lyso&#8208;H2S: A Mycophenolic Acid&#8208;Derived Probe for Ultra&#8208;Low Toxicity, Intracellular H2S Detection, and Zebrafish Model Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the MPA scaffold&#8208;inspired fluorescent probe Lyso&#8208;H2S that allows H2S detection with an LOD of 41.8&#8197;nM. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects H2S in lysosomes based on the PET+ ESIPT sensing mechanism. The probe allows for real&#8208;time monitoring of H2S in vivo, particularly in the intestine and gallbladder of a zebrafish. Lyso&#8208;H2S was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of H2S in living cells.







Abstract
In several biological processes, H2S is known to function as an endogenous gaseous agent. It is very necessary to monitor H2S and relevant physiological processes in&#8197;vivo. Herein, a new type of fluorophore with a reliable leaving group allows for excited&#8208;state intramolecular transfer characteristics (ESIPT), inspired by mycophenolic acid. A morpholine ring was connected at the maleimide position of the probe to target the lysosome. Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probe Lyso&#8208;H2S. Lyso&#8208;H2S demonstrated strong selectivity towards H2S, a large Stokes shift (111&#8197;nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8&#8197;nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H2S in living cells (A549&#8197;cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra&#8208;low toxicity (100&#8201;% cell viability at 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of Lyso&#8208;H2S.) Additionally, Lyso&#8208;H2S was also employed to visualize the activity of H2S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H2S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.

Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn-on&#8221; probe &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated strong selectivity towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, a large Stokes shift (111&#8197;nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8&#8197;nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in living cells (A549&#8197;cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra-low toxicity (100&#8201;% cell viability at 50&#8197;&#956;M concentration of &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;.) Additionally, &lt;b&gt;Lyso-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; was also employed to visualize the activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Efficient Eu(III) and Yb(III) Sensitisation from a Re(I) Tetrazolato Triangular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triangular assembly featuring three Re(I) and three Eu(III) centres displays an unprecedented sensitisation efficiency, around 90&#8201;%, whereby the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligang charget transfer excited state of the Re(I) complex acts as a sensitiser for the Eu(III) emission. Spectroscopic investigation reveals that the sensitisation proceeds via a thermally activated two&#8208;step mechanism involving the bridging terpyridine ligand, and provides new insights for the design of d&#8208;f assemblies with efficient luminescent properties.







Abstract
The reaction of Re(CO)5Br with deprotonated 1H&#8208;(5&#8208;(2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine)pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)tetrazole yields a triangular assembly formed by tricarbonyl Re(I) vertices. Photophysical measurements reveal blue&#8208;green emission with a maximum at 520&#8197;nm, 32&#8201;% quantum yield, and 2430&#8197;ns long&#8208;lived excited state decay lifetime in deaerated dichloromethane solution. Coordination of lanthanoid ions to the terpyridine units red&#8208;shifts the emission to 570&#8197;nm and also reveals efficient (90&#8201;%) and fast sensitisation of both Eu(III) and Yb(III) at room temperature, with a similar rate constant kET on the order of 107&#8197;s&#8722;1. Efficient sensitisation of Eu(III) from Re(I) is unprecedented, especially when considering the close proximity in energy between the donor and acceptor excited states. On the other hand, comparative measurements at 77&#8197;K reveal that energy transfer to Yb(III) is two orders of magnitude slower than that to Eu(III). A two&#8208;step mechanism of sensitisation is therefore proposed, whereby the rate&#8208;determining step is a thermally activated energy transfer step between the Re(I) centre and the terpyridine functionality, followed by rapid energy transfer to the respective Ln(III) excited states. At 77&#8197;K, the direct Re(I) to Eu(III) energy transfer seems to proceed via a ligand&#8208;mediated superexchange Dexter&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>Aromaticity in the Spectroscopic Spotlight of Hexaphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through TD&#8208;DFT calculations, aromaticity descriptors, and chemical compound space maps, we connected the spectroscopic fingerprints of functionalized hexaphyrins to the macrocycle's aromaticity. While the intensity of the Q&#8208;band in the NIR region is well described by (&#916;HOMO&#8211;&#916;LUMO)2 and not by their aromaticity descriptors, highly planar and hexaphyrin structures showing large aromaticity and antiaromaticity exhibit an intense B&#8208;band.







Abstract
Spectroscopic properties are commonly used in the experimental evaluation of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity in expanded porphyrins. Herein, we investigate if the defining photophysical properties still hold for a diverse set of hexaphyrins with varying redox states, topologies, peripheral substitutions, and core&#8208;modifications. By combining TD&#8208;DFT calculations with several aromaticity descriptors and chemical compound space maps, the intricate interplay between structural planarity, aromaticity, and absorption spectra is elucidated. Our results emphasize that the general assumption that antiaromatic porphyrinoids exhibit significantly attenuated absorption bands as compared to aromatic counterparts does not hold even for the unsubstituted hexaphyrin macrocycles. To connect the spectroscopic properties to the hexaphyrins&#8217; aromaticity behaviour, we analyzed chemical compound space maps defined by the various aromaticity indices. The intensity of the Q&#8208;band is not well described by the macrocyclic aromaticity. Instead, the degeneracy of the frontier molecular orbitals, the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and the |&#916;HOMO&#8211;&#916;LUMO|2 values appear to be better indicators to identify hexaphyrins with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing abilities in the near&#8208;infrared region. Regions with highly planar hexaphyrin structures, both aromatic and antiaromatic, are characterized by an intense B&#8208;band. Hence, we advise using a combination of global and local aromaticity descriptors rooted in different criteria to assess the aromaticity of expanded porphyrins instead of solely relying on the absorption spectra.

         <title>Stereoselective Crystallization of Chiral Pharmaceuticals Aided by Cellulose Derivatives through Helical Pattern Matching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design principle of helical pattern matching between the polymeric additives and the crystal surfaces are proposed for the stereoselective crystallization of chiral pharmaceuticals. A novel design principle of helical pattern matching between polymeric additives and crystal surfaces is proposed for the stereoselective crystallization of chiral pharmaceuticals. This method, demonstrated with nimodipine, guaifenesin, and phenyl lactic acid, achieves high enantiomeric purity, highlighting a new strategy for using natural biomolecules in chiral recognition and resolution.







Abstract
Stereoselective inhibition aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient approach to obtain enantiopure compounds through conglomerate crystallization. The chemical and configurational match between the side groups of polymers and the molecules of undesired enantiomer is considered to be a necessary condition for successful stereoseparation. Whereas in this contribution, we present an effective resolution of chiral pharmaceuticals by using cellulose acetates as the additives, which stereoselectively reside on the specific crystal faces of one enantiomer and inhibit its crystal nucleation and growth through helical pattern and supramolecular interaction complementarity. An investigation of nimodipine serves as a case study to highlight the novelty of this strategy wherein R&#8208;crystals exhibiting an impressive enantiomeric excess value of 97&#8201;% can be attained by employing a mere 0.01&#8197;wt&#8201;% cellulose acetate. Guaifenesin and phenyl lactic acid are also well&#8208;resolved by utilizing this methodology. Our work not only brings about a brand&#8208;new design strategy for &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; additives, but will also promote the further exploration of the endless potential for utilizing natural biomolecules in chiral recognition and resolution.

         <title>Hollow CeO2&#8208;Based Nanozyme with Self&#8208;Accelerated Cascade Reactions for Combined Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA nanozyme with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions achieve combined tumor treatment including photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy and starvation therapy. CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA nanoplatform with negligible systemic toxicity not only overcomes the defects of natural enzymes and single&#8208;modal tumor therapy, but also provides an ideal combinational therapeutic treatment for tumor therapy with high efficiency.







Abstract
Nanozymes have obvious advantages in improving the efficiency of cancer treatment. However, due to the lack of tissue specificity, low catalytic efficiency, and so on, their clinical applications are limited. Herein, the nanoplatform CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA (CIGH) with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions is constructed. The as&#8208;prepared nanozyme shows the superior oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like, superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities. At the same time, under 808&#8197;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the photodynamic and photothermal capabilities are also significantly enhanced due to the presence of indocyanine green (ICG). We demonstrate that the nanozyme CIGH can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity through the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and starvation therapy. The nanozyme prepared in this study provides a promising candidate for catalytic nanomedicines for efficient tumor therapy.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review emphasizes the significant advancements made in the precise synthesis of MXenes, which is crucial for tailoring the properties of MXenes to suit specific applications. Furthermore, the review highlights the immense potential of MXene&#8208;based materials for carbon capture applications.







Abstract
MXenes, a class of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable potential for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and gas separation applications. The fabrication processes of MXene involve building up the MXene structure from constituent elements and the selective elimination of M&#8722;A bonds from the precursor MAX. However, considerable efforts are still required to design and develop efficient MXene&#8208;based technologies. This review article aims to briefly analyse the synthesis methods employed for MXene production, ranging from direct synthesis and conventional chemical wet etching approach to the more recent molten salt etching technique. The review highlights the advancements made in achieving precise control over the terminal groups, which is paramount for tailoring the properties of MXenes for specific applications. Furthermore, the potential of MXene&#8208;based materials for carbon capture applications, particularly in developing advanced adsorbents, is emphasized. The in&#8208;depth examination of MXene synthesis techniques and their implications for carbon capture applications provides a solid foundation for developing and optimizing these promising materials.

         <dc:description>
The concept described the development of a chiral acetal&#8208;based stereo&#8208;controlled degradable polymer, which was prepared via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization with the controlled addition of highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers from Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of alkoxyallene and ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract

         <title>A Phosphoramidate Prodrug Platform: One&#8208;Pot Amine Functionalization of Kinase Inhibitors with Oligoethylene Glycol for Improved Water&#8208;Solubility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot approach is employed for the transformation of three different kinase inhibitors into oligoethylene glycol&#8208;functionalized prodrugs. These prodrugs exhibit superior solubility in water and improved cell uptake in HeLa cells. The phosphoramidate&#8208;based promoiety provides a universal platform for drugs with amine groups, enabling acid&#8208;catalyzed drug release within target cells.







Abstract
Small molecular kinase inhibitors play a key role in modern cancer therapy. Protein kinases are essential mediators in the growth and progression of cancerous tumors, rendering involved kinases an increasingly important target for therapy. However, kinase inhibitors are almost insoluble in water because of their hydrophobic aromatic nature, often lowering their availability and pharmacological efficacy. Direct drug functionalization with polar groups represents a simple strategy to improve the drug solubility, availability, and performance. Here, we present a strategy to functionalize secondary amines with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) phosphate using a one&#8208;pot synthesis in three exemplary kinase inhibiting drugs Ceritinib, Crizotinib, and Palbociclib. These OEG&#8208;prodrug conjugates demonstrate superior solubility in water compared to the native drugs, with the solubility increasing up to 190&#8208;fold. The kinase inhibition potential is only slightly decreased for the conjugates compared to the native drugs. We further show pH dependent hydrolysis of the OEG&#8208;prodrugs which releases the native drug. We observe a slow release at pH&#8197;3, while the conjugates remain stable over 96&#8197;h under physiological conditions (pH&#8197;7.4). Using confocal microscopy, we verify improved cell uptake of the drug&#8208;OEG conjugates into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, further supporting our universal solubility approach.

         <title>The Unimolecular Decomposition Mechanism of Trimethyl Phosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double imaging photoelectron photo&#8208;ion coincidence spectroscopy using vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation reveals the thermal decomposition mechanism of trimethyl phosphate, a fire&#8208;retardant additive candidate of lithium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. A dimethyl ether production channel was confirmed by thermolysis experiments and quantum chemical calculations. This fundamental understanding can help the development of a chemical kinetic model and the design of better fire suppressants.







Abstract
Trimethyl phosphate (TMP), an organophosphorus compound (OPC), is a promising fire&#8208;retardant candidate for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrolytes to mitigate fire spread. This study aims to understand the mechanism of TMP unimolecular thermal decomposition to support the integration of a TMP chemical kinetic model into a LIB electrolyte surrogate model. Reactive intermediates and products of TMP thermal decomposition were experimentally detected using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation and double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectroscopy. Phosphorus&#8208;containing intermediates such as PO, HPO and HPO2 were identified. Sampling effects could successfully be obviated thanks to photoion imaging, which also showed evidence for isomerization reactions upon wall collisions in the ionization chamber. Quantum chemical calculations performed for the unimolecular decomposition of TMP revealed for the first time that isomerization channels via hydrogen and methyl transfer (barrier heights of 65.9 and 72.6&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively) are the lowest&#8208;energy primary steps of TMP decomposition followed by CH3OH/CH3/CH2O or dimethyl ether (DME) production, respectively. We found an analogous DME production channel in the unimolecular decomposition of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), another important OPC fire&#8208;retardant additive with a similar molecular structure to TMP, which are not included in currently available chemical kinetic models.

         <title>Strategies for the Development of Asymmetric and Non&#8208;Directed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Petasis reaction is a powerful multi&#8208;component method for the construction of highly functionalized amines. However, this transformation is limited in that it requires a directing group on the aldehyde component and asymmetric reports are scarce. This Concept highlights key strategies for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions and suggests areas in the field where further methodology advancement is needed.







Abstract
The Petasis reaction is a multicomponent reaction of aldehydes, amines and organoboron reagents and is a useful method for the construction of substituted amines. Despite the significant advancement of the Petasis reaction since its invention in 1993, strategies for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions remain limited. To date, there are very few catalytic asymmetric Petasis reactions and almost all asymmetric reports employ a chiral auxiliary. Likewise, the aldehyde component often requires a directing group, ultimately limiting the reaction's scope. In this Concept, key methods for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions are discussed, focusing on how these conceptual advances can be applied to solve long&#8208;standing gaps in the Petasis literature.

Clathrate hydrates possess a variety of unique features, including the confinement effect of H&#8208;bonding nanocages, H&#8208;bond catalysis and proton/hydrogen sources, ability to enhance molecules&#8217; electron&#8208;binding and stabilizing the trapped electrons, which make clathrate hydrate promising nanoreactors.







Abstract
Since their discovery, clathrate hydrates (CHs) have received great attention both from theoretical and experimental aspects due to their great potential for gas storage and prospective applications as icy crystal materials. However, there has been limited research on the decomposition, reduction or other reactions of gases enclosed in CHs. Thanks to their unique hydrogen bonding network and cavity structures, CHs can serve as the promising nanoreactors to achieve chemical conversions, e.&#8201;g. reducing greenhouse gases. In this review&#8208;type article, we characterize the potential performance of such CHs nanoreactors by discussing their multiple functions including important roles of hydrogen bonds in CHs, e.&#8201;g. the confinement effect and proton source, and then discuss the enhanced electron&#8208;binding ability of guest molecules and the structures and properties of trapped electrons in the stacked nanocages, which contribute to our understanding of chemical reactions occurring in CHs. Finally, we provide detailed analyses of representative reaction mechanisms underwent in CH nanoreactors and effective calculational and molecular dynamics simulation methods. This review&#8208;type article aims to provide a detailed summary about the functional characteristics of CHs and reactivity in CHs, which make CHs a kind of promising icy nanoreactors.

         <dc:description>An efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted aryl naphthoquinones via a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed template&#8208;assisted m&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H bond functionalization reaction of arylmethane sulfonates have been demonstrated. The method involves usage of less expensive and abundant pharmacologically important scaffold naphthoquinone. A wide range of arylmethane sulfonates were examined and found to be compatible with the protocol. The protocol has also been further extended to the synthesis of various substituted aryl maleimide scaffolds. A plausible reaction mechanism has also been proposed to account for the selective distal m&#8208;C(sp2)&#8208;H bond functionalization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic or Neutral: Dependence of Photophysical Properties of Bis&#8208;alkynylphosphonium Pt(II) Complexes on Ancillary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alkynylphosphonium salts with different linker between donor and acceptor groups was used to synthesize two series of trans&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynylphosphonium Pt(II) complexes with different ancillary ligands (triphenylphosphine, P series, and cyanide, CN series). The nature of the ancillary ligand manages the overall charge and emission properties of the complexes obtained. In addition, the variation of the linker in alkynylphosphonium ligands allows fine&#8208;tuning the luminescence wavelength. Dicationic series P is unstable in solution under UV excitation, whereas in the solid state, these complexes are the first example of phosphorescent trans&#8208;phosphine&#8208;bis&#8208;alkynyl Pt(II) compounds. Neutral series CN demonstrates bright emission in solution, including dual emission for 2CN complex with biphenyl linker in alkynylphosphonium ligands. However, in the solid state for the CN series drastic decrease in the emission quantum yield compared to the P series was observed. DFT calculations reveal the complicated emission nature for the both P and CN series with various contributions of 3ILCT, 3LLCT and 3MLCT states. However, in the naphthyl&#8208;containing derivatives 3P and 3CN, the dominating 3LC character with some admixture of CT states is postulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;(Phenylamino)quinazoline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;thiones Using Green Solvents.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the importance of quinazolines and quinazolinethiones in therapeutic and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved molecules, we thought interesting to consider their synthesis in green solvents. We have shown that obtain 4&#8208;(arylamino)quinazoline&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;thiones and 4&#8208;(arylamino)pteridine&#8208;2&#8208;(1H)&#8208;thiones analogues was efficient in green solvents derived from biomass, especially eucalyptol. Although reaction times are somewhat long to achieve good yields, the products were obtained by simple filtration. This considerably limited the loss of atoms due to the use of large quantities of solvents for purification on silica gel columns, and makes our route a sustainable one.</dc:description>

         <title>Tripodal BODIPY&#8208;Tagged and Functional Molecular Probes: Synthesis, Computational Investigations and Explorations by Multiphoton Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on new and conjugatable tripodal compounds which open up the possibility for multiplexing with BODIPY tags for studies by confocal microscopy and 2P FLIM with structural and photochemical predictions underpinned by TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
A range of novel BODIPY derivatives with a tripodal aromatic core was synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. These new fluorophores showed promising features as probes for in&#8197;vitro assays in live cells and offer strategic routes for further functionalization towards hybrid nanomaterials. Incorporation of biotin tags facilitated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept access to targeted bioconjugates as molecular probes. Computational explorations using DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations identified the most stable tripodal linker conformations and predicted their absorption and emission behavior. The uptake and speciation of these molecules in living prostate cancer cells was imaged by single&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excitation techniques coupled with two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2P FLIM).

         <title>Unraveling the Source of Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism&#160;in Chiral Dipeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mastering of analytical methods for accurate quantitative determinations of enantiomeric excess is a crucial aspect in asymmetric catalysis, chiral synthesis, and pharmaceutical applications. In this context, the phenomenon of Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism&#160;(SIDA) can be exploited in NMR spectroscopy for accurate determinations of enantiomeric composition, without using a chiral auxiliary that could interfere with the spectroscopic investigation. This phenomenon can be particularly useful for improving the quantitative analysis of mixtures with low enantiomeric excesses, where direct integration of signals can be tricky. Here, we describe a novel analysis protocol to correctly determine the enantiomeric composition of scalemic mixtures and investigate the thermodynamic and stereochemical features at the basis of SIDA. Dipeptide derivatives were chosen as substrates for this study, given their central role in drug design. By integrating the experiments with a conformational stochastic search that includes entropic contributions, we provide valuable information on the dimerization thermodynamics, the nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions leading to self&#8208;association, and the differences in the chemical environment responsible for the anisochrony, highlighting the importance of different stereochemical arrangement and tight association for the distinction between homochiral and heterochiral adducts. An important role played by the counterion was pointed out by computational studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The difunctionalization of alkenes represents a powerful tool to incorporate two functional groups into the alkene bones for increasing molecular complexity and has been widely utilizations in chemical synthesis. Upon the catalysis of the green, sustainable, mild photo&#8208;/electrochemistry technologies, much attentions have been attracted to the development of new tactics for the transformations of the important alkene and alkane feedstocks driven by C&#8208;H radical functionalization.

We detailedly discuss the substrate scope and the mechanisms of the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions by selecting impressive synthetic examples, which are divided into four sections based on the final terminated step, including oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover coupling, radical&#8208;radical coupling, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling.</dc:description>

Herein, we summarize recent advances in the photo-/electrocatalytic difunctionalization of alkenes enabled by C-H radical functionalization. We detailedly discuss the substrate scope and the mechanisms of the photo-/electrocatalytic alkene difunctionalization reactions by selecting impressive synthetic examples, which are divided into four sections based on the final terminated step, including oxidative radical-polar crossover coupling, reductive radical-polar crossover coupling, radical-radical coupling, and transition-metal-catalyzed coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly As A Means To Study Mediated Thiol/Disulfide Exchange in Supramolecular Dynamic Covalent Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange has been an active field of study for biochemists and physical organic chemists alike due to its prevalence within biological systems and fundamentally interesting dynamic nature. More recently, efforts have been made to harness the power of this reversible reaction to make self&#8208;assembling systems of macrocyclic and cage&#8208;like molecules. However, less effort has focused on the fundamental study of isolating these assemblies and analyzing the factors that control the assembly and sorting of these emerging cyclic systems. We have shown previously that pnictogen&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly enables formation of discrete disulfide macrocycles and cages without competition from polymer formation for a wide variety of alkyl thiols. Herein we report the expansion of these methods to form disulfide macrocycles from aryl thiol containing ligands, allowing access to previously unreported molecules. More importantly, the development of this new self&#8208;assembly chemistry allows for a comparison of aryl vs alkyl disulfide exchange and self&#8208;assembly. These studies complement classical physical organic and chemical biology studies on the kinetics and thermodynamics of aryl thiol oxidation to disulfides, and we show that this self&#8208;assembly method revises some prevailing wisdom from these key classical studies by providing new product distributions and new isolable products in cyclic disulfide formation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Solid&#8208;state Multi&#8208;color Fluorescence Switching from a [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;based Triarylborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorophores, the fluorescence of which can be switched between multi bright colors in the solid state, show promising applications not only in the sophisticated multicolor display but also in the advanced encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems. However, it is very challenging to obtain such fluorophores. Herein, we disclose such an example, g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp, which contains an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino (NMe2) and an electron&#8208;accepting [(2&#8208;dimesitylboryl)phenyl]acetyl at the pseudo&#8208;gem position of [2.2]paracyclophane skeleton. This molecule can display tricolor mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) due to the different responses of the mechanically ground amorphous state to heating and solvent&#8208;fuming. Owing to the absence of intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions in the solid state, the fluorescence efficiency is very high irrespective of its morphological state (&#934;F = 0.60&#8211;0.87). Moreover, this molecule also displays reversible acidochromic luminescence (ACL) by protonation and deprotonation of NMe2 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylamine (TEA), respectively. The protonated sample fluoresces&#160;(&#934;F = 0.31) at much shorter wavelength due to the interruption of intramolecular charge transfer process. Therefore, with the combination of tricolor MCL and the ACL properties, the solid&#8208;state emission of g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp can be switched among four bright fluorescence colors of yellow, green, cyan and blue via treatment with appropriate stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Triphenylamine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Systems for Efficient Ternary WORM Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The resistive switching memory behaviour of D&#8722;A architectured triphenylamine&#8208;based small organic molecules has been investigated. Conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory is achieved through fine&#8208;tuning substituents on the D&#8722;A system, which paves the way for the strategic design of molecules for developing highly efficient data storage systems.







Abstract
The impact of various substituent moieties on the molecular framework of a conjugated D&#8722;A system in resistive switching memory property has been scrutinized through an array of novel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules. The synthesized molecules with triphenylamine (TPA) as the electron donor and dicyanovinylindanone (IC) as the electron acceptor demonstrated substantial non&#8208;volatile WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many) memory behaviour with appreciable ON/OFF current ratios up to 105 and a lowest recorded threshold voltage of &#8722;0.80&#8197;V. The well&#8208;balanced combination of these potent electron donating and accepting units culminated in exceptional intramolecular charge transfer interactions and minimal band gap values (1.82&#8211;2.31&#8197;eV) for the molecules, as demonstrated by photophysical and electrochemical investigations. These factors, coupled with the thin&#8208;film morphological studies, corroborated the superior performance of the fabricated devices. A longer retention time of 2000s and an endurance of 100 cycles mark the substantial stability of the memory devices. Moreover, conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory was achieved by the effective tuning of the electronic properties of the D&#8722;A systems by various substituent moieties. Molecular simulation studies revealed that the resistive switching phenomenon arises from a synergistic interplay of charge transfer and charge trapping processes within these D&#8722;A systems.

         <title>Advances in Bioinspired Artificial System Enabling Biomarker&#8208;Driven Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomarker&#8208;driven therapy holds significant potential to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. In this review, we explore recent advancements in bioinspired artificial systems and their therapeutic applications, with a particular emphasis on the capabilities of these BAS modalities. We discuss their roles in enabling on&#8208;demand activation, targeted drug delivery, intelligent treatment, and precision cell therapy, highlighting how these technologies can lead to more effective and tailored healthcare solutions.







Abstract
Bioinspired molecular engineering strategies have emerged as powerful tools that significantly enhance the development of novel therapeutics, improving efficacy, specificity, and safety in disease treatment. Recent advancements have focused on identifying and utilizing disease&#8208;associated biomarkers to optimize drug activity and address challenges inherent in traditional therapeutics, such as frequent drug administrations, poor patient adherence, and increased risk of adverse effects. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in bioinspired artificial systems (BAS) that use molecular engineering to tailor therapeutic responses to drugs in the presence of disease&#8208;specific biomarkers. We examine the transition from open&#8208;loop systems, which rely on external cues, to closed&#8208;loop feedback systems capable of autonomous self&#8208;regulation in response to disease&#8208;associated biomarkers. We detail various BAS modalities designed to achieve biomarker&#8208;driven therapy, including activatable prodrug molecules, smart drug delivery platforms, autonomous artificial cells, and synthetic receptor&#8208;based cell therapies, elucidating their operational principles and practical in&#8197;vivo applications. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives in the advancement of BAS&#8208;enabled technology and envision that ongoing advancements toward more programmable and customizable BAS&#8208;based therapeutics will significantly enhance precision medicine.

A convertible cyanine/hemicyanine PA dye platform Cy&#8208;HCy with optimized NIR ratiometric PA properties and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities for PA probe development and precise colorectal liver metastasis diagnosis.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) tomography is an emerging biomedical imaging technology for precision cancer medicine. Conventional small&#8208;molecule PA probes usually exhibit a single PA signal and poor tumor targeting that lack the imaging reliability. Here, we introduce a series of cyanine/hemicyanine interconversion dyes (denoted Cy&#8208;HCy) for PA/fluorescent dual&#8208;mode probe development that features optimized ratiometric PA imaging and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting ability for precise diagnosis and resection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, Cy&#8208;HCy can be presented in cyanine (inherent tumor targeting and long NIR PA wavelength) and hemicyanine (poor tumor targeting and short NIR PA wavelength) by fine&#8208;tuning torsion angle and the ingenious transformation between cyanine and hemicyanine through regulation optically tunable group endows the NIR ratiometric PA and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting properties. To demonstrate the applicability of Cy&#8208;HCy dyes, we designed the first small&#8208;molecule tumor&#8208;targeting and NIR ratiometric PA probe Cy&#8208;HCy&#8208;H2S for precise CRC liver metastasis diagnosis, activated by H2S (a CRC biomarker). Using this probe, we not only visualized the subcutaneous tumor and liver metastatic cancers in CRC mouse models but also realized PA and fluorescence image&#8208;guided tumor excision. We expect that Cy&#8208;HCy will be generalized for creating a wide variety of inherently tumor&#8208;targeting NIR ratiometric PA probes in oncological research and practice.

         <title>Dissolution of g&#8208;C3N4 Using Zinc Chloride Molten Salt Hydrates for Nanobelt Fabrication and Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method has been developed for dissolving g&#8208;C3N4 using ZnCl2 molten salt hydrates, which achieve high solubility (up to 200&#8197;mg/ml) and efficient recovery while maintaining structure. The regenerated C3N4 (r&#8208;C3N4) presents nanobelt morphology and exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in H2O2 production.







Abstract
Graphitic&#8208;carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4), a metal&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional layered semiconductor material, holds great potential for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and sensing. However, the limited solubility of g&#8208;C3N4 in conventional solvents hinders its widespread application. Improving the dissolution of g&#8208;C3N4 in the liquid phase is highly desired but challenging. Herein, we report an innovative approach to dissolve g&#8208;C3N4 using ZnCl2 molten salt hydrates. The solubility of g&#8208;C3N4 in the solution reaches up to 200&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that ZnCl+H2O is the key species that leads to charge redistribution on g&#8208;C3N4 surface and promotes the dissolution of carbon nitride in the solution. Furthermore, through dilution, the dissolved carbon nitride can be effectively recovered while maintaining its intrinsic chemical structure. The resultant regenerated C3N4 (r&#8208;C3N4) exhibits nanobelt morphology and demonstrates a substantially improved photocatalytic activity in H2O2 production. The rate of H2O2 production over the r&#8208;C3N4 reaches 20,228&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 6.2 times higher than that of pristine g&#8208;C3N4. This green and efficient dissolution route of g&#8208;C3N4 offers an effective approach for its diverse applications.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Characterization of Uniform Au Nanospheres Capped by Citrate for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand exchange. By depositing one atomic layer of fresh Au atoms onto CTAB/CTAC&#8208;capped 10&#8208;nm Au spheres in the presence of citrate at an adequate concentration, the original surface&#8208;bound CTAB/CTAC is replaced with citrate. The newly formed citrate&#8208;capped 10&#8208;nm Au spheres show a decrease in cell toxicity.







Abstract
We report a simple and versatile method for effectively replacing the toxic ligands, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), on the surface of Au nanospheres with different sizes by citrate. The method involves the deposition of an ultrathin shell of fresh Au in the presence of sodium citrate at an adequate concentration. After the ligand exchange process, multiple techniques are used to confirm that the surface of the resultant Au nanospheres is covered by citrate while there is no sign of aggregation. We also demonstrate the mitigation of cell toxicity after exchanging the surface&#8208;bound CTAB/CTAC with citrate, opening the door to a range of biomedical applications.

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State N&#8722;H Tautomerization Rate in Free&#8208;Base Corroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrole, akin to porphyrin but with a missing carbon, exhibits unique structural and dynamic properties. Three pyrrolic protons induce a dynamic equilibrium between tautomeric structures, favoring one in excited states due to energy disparities. Despite the tautomerization being known, few studies exist. Ultrafast photoluminescence reveals rates and activation energies, unraveling the excited&#8208;state dynamics.







Abstract
Corrole is a tetrapyrrolic dye with a structure that resembles porphyrin, apart from a single missing carbon. The absence of this carbon results in the re&#8208;arrangement of the double bonds within the macrocycle, and the presence of three pyrrolic protons in the central cavity in its free&#8208;base form. These protons lead to the existence of two distinct tautomeric structures that exist in a dynamic equilibrium. Although the ground&#8208;state energies of the tautomers are similar, the excited states show a significant difference in energy which unbalances the equilibrium between the tautomers and results in rapid excited&#8208;state tautomerization, favouring one tautomeric species over the other. Although the excited&#8208;state tautomerization process has been known for a long time, very few studies have been performed on it, leaving many key aspects of the process poorly understood. Herein we show how ultrafast photoluminescence can be used to experimentally determine the rates of excited&#8208;state tautomerization and activation energies of three free&#8208;base corrole derivatives thus allowing us to completely describe the excited&#8208;state dynamics of the unusual excited state of free&#8208;base corrole and opening the door to the development of new materials that can exploit its unique characteristics.

         <title>Tetraazaisoindigos:Serpentine Syntheses and Their Expected and Unexpected Photophysical and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoindigo, an&#160;electron&#8208;withdrawing building block for polymeric field&#8208;effect transistors, has long been considered to be non&#8208;fluorescent. Moreover, using electron&#8208;deficient heterocycle to replace the phenyl ring in the isoindigo core for better electron transport behaviour is synthetically challenging. Here we report the syntheses of a series of tetraazaisoindigos, including pyrazinoisoindigo (PyrII), pyrimidoisoindigo (PymII) and their hybrid (PyrPymII), and the investigation on their photophysical and electric properties. Proper flanking groups need to be chosen to stabilize these highly electron&#8208;deficient bislactams. Both PyrII&#160;and&#160;PymII&#160;derivatives show&#160;lower LUMO energy levels than that of naphthalene bisimide (NDI). Interestingly, PyrII is instinctively unstable and can be easily reduced, while both PymII derivatives are stable. More surprisingly, PymII derivatives are highly fluorescent and their photoluminescence quantum yields are around 40%, 133 times higher than that of reported isoindigo derivatives. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic results and theoretical calculations show that strong intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond exists in PymII, which&#160;prohibits it from non&#8208;radiative decay and accounts for its fluorescent behaviour. &#160;PymII deriviatives are n&#8208;type semiconductors, while Ph&#8208;PyrII and the hybrid show balanced ambipolar charge transport behaviour, all among the best isoindigo derivatives. Our study not only discloses the structure&#8208;property relationship of tetraazaisoindigos, but also provides&#160;electron&#8208;deficient monomers for conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

UV-vis spectroscopic results and theoretical calculations show that strong intramolecular hydrogen-bond exists in PymII, which&#160;prohibits it from non-radiative decay and accounts for its fluorescent behaviour. &#160;PymII deriviatives are n-type semiconductors, while Ph-PyrII and the hybrid show balanced ambipolar charge transport behaviour, all among the best isoindigo derivatives. Our study not only discloses the structure-property relationship of tetraazaisoindigos, but also provides&#160;electron-deficient monomers for conjugated polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical CO2&#160;Reduction Reaction: Comprehensive Strategic Approaches to Catalyst Design for Selective Liquid Products Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating concern regarding the release of CO2 into the atmosphere poses a significant threat to the contemporary efforts in mitigating climate change. Amidst a multitude of strategies for curtailing CO2 emissions, the electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a promising avenue for transforming CO2 molecules into a diverse array of valuable gaseous and liquid products, such as CO, CH3OH, CH4, HCO2H, C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3CO2H, 1&#8208;C3H7OH and others. The mechanistic investigations of gaseous products (e.g. CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and others) broadly covered in the literature. There is a noticeable gap in the literature when it comes to a comprehensive summary exclusively dedicated to coherent roadmap for the designing principles for a selective catalyst all possible liquid products (such as CH3OH, C2H5OH, 1&#8208;C3H7OH, 2&#8208;C3H7OH, 1&#8208;C4H9OH, as well as other C3&#8208;C4 products like methylglyoxal and 2,3&#8208;furandiol, in addition to HCO2H, AcOH, oxalic acid and others), selectively converted by CO2 reduction. This entails a meticulous analysis to justify these approaches and a thorough exploration of the correlation between materials and their electrocatalytic properties. Furthermore, these insightful discussions illuminate the future prospects for practical applications, a facet not exhaustively examined in prior reviews.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (15R)&#8208; and (15S)&#8208;Prostaglandin A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caribbean Vibes in the Lab: Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone, which is also present in Caribbean Sea whips. The short and robust total syntheses of both naturally occurring PGA2 epimers and the subsequent biological evaluation of both compounds revealed an interaction of PGA2 depending on the stereochemistry at C15.







Abstract
From both pharmaceutical and structural perspectives, the large family of prostaglandins represent a truly remarkable class of natural products. Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone naturally found in human seminal plasma and in the sea whip Plexaura homomalla with yet poorly understood biological or therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel strategy for the stereoselective construction of both naturally occurring prostaglandin A2 epimers and first insights into their functional effects on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAAR) are provided. The synthesis of both epimers was achieved in only 11 steps starting from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;tetrahydrofuran employing an organocatalytic domino&#8208;aldol reaction, a Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction, a Wittig reaction as well as an oxidation&#8208;decarboxylation sequence. The (15R)&#8208;epimer significantly reduced GABA&#8208;induced currents through GABAA receptors while its (15S)&#8208;epimer did not show any significant effect. These data suggest that (15R)&#8208;PGA2 might serve as a novel scaffold for the development of selective GABAA receptor modulators.

         <title>Red Fluorescent Aminoferrocene (Pro)Drugs for in Cellulo and in Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BODIPY derivative BDP&#8208;TR was identified as a non&#8208;biased red&#8208;fluorescent dye for labelling of low molecular weight (pro)drugs. The labelling does not affect intracellular localization and mode of action of the (pro)drugs. The BDP&#8208;TR&#8208;conjugates were used to clarify the mechanism of activation and in&#8197;vivo distribution of the representative (pro)drugs.







Abstract
Red fluorescent dyes are usually charged, lipophilic molecules with relatively high molecular weight, which tend to localize in specific intracellular locations, e.&#8201;g., a cyanine dye Cy5 is biased towards mitochondria. They are often used as markers of biomolecules including nucleic acids and proteins. Since the molecular weight of the dyes is much smaller than that of the biomolecules, the labelling has a negligible effect on the properties of the biomolecules. In contrast, conjugation of the dyes to low molecular weight (pro)drugs can dramatically alter their properties. For example, conjugates of Cy5 with lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes accumulate in mitochondria and exhibit no intracellular effects characteristic for the parent (pro)drugs. Herein we tested several neutral and negatively charged dyes for labelling lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes 7 and 8 as well as a non&#8208;targeted control 3. We found that a BODIPY derivative BDP&#8208;TR exhibits the desired unbiased properties: the conjugation does not disturb the intracellular localization of the (pro)drugs, their mode of action, and cancer cell specificity. We used the conjugates to clarify the mechanism of action of the aminoferrocenes. In particular, we identified new intermediates, explained why lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes are more potent than their non&#8208;targeted counterparts, and evaluated their distribution in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Advancements and Challenges in the Synthesis of Oxymethylene Ethers (OMEs) as Sustainable Transportation Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept reviews the recent advancements in the field of oxymethylene ether (OME) production. We discuss mechanistic details as well as synthesis conditions examined in the last decade. We identified the Schulz&#8208;Flory product distribution, the energy efficiency, the influence of water as well as the production of suitable starting materials as the main challenges to establishing a large&#8208;scale OME production.







Abstract
The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector is driving research into novel energy carriers that can meet the high energy density requirements of heavy&#8208;duty vehicles without exacerbating the climate change. This concept article examines the synthesis, mechanisms, and challenges associated with oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), a promising class of synthetic fuels potentially derived from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. We highlight the importance of OMEs in the transition towards non&#8208;fossil energy sources due to their compatibility with the existing Diesel infrastructure and their cleaner combustion profile. The synthesis mechanisms, including the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution and its implications for OME chain length specificity, and the role of various catalysts and starting materials are discussed in depth. Despite advancements in the field, significant challenges remain, such as overcoming the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution, efficiently managing water as an undesirable byproduct, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the OME synthesis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for OMEs to become a viable alternative fuel, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy future in the transportation sector.

         <title>Functionalized Metal&#8208;organic Framework for NADH Regeneration by Hydrogen in a Redox Flow Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ holds significant promise for the industrial synthesis of chiral chemicals. However, challenges persist due to the high consumption of NADH and the limited efficiency of its cyclic regeneration, which currently hinder widespread application. To address these obstacles, based on in&#8208;situ growth of 3D ordered metal&#8208;organic framework (NU&#8208;1000) on the surface of graphite felt, [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ were immobilized on the Zr6 nodes of NU&#8208;1000 by solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation (SALI), and applied in a flow bioreactor. Moreover, we employ a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to oxidize H2, providing a clean proton source for the electrochemical regeneration of NADH. Consequently, highly efficient enzymatic electrocatalytic synthesis of L&#8208;lactate was achieved when coupled with L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a model reaction, and the total turnover number (TTN) reached 19600 and 1750 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+ after 48 h, corresponding to a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2350 h&#8208;1 and 210 h&#8208;1 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+, respectively. This work provides new insights for the construction of efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Lysosomal Cathepsin A and Neuraminidase 1 Interaction by Anti&#8208;obesity Cyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novel small molecules targeting adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation offer potential for new anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;obesity drugs. Here we show that the marine cyclic heptapeptide stylissatin A and its analogs (SAs) inhibit membranous neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) function by interacting with lysosomal protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA). Neu1 has been less explored as a therapeutic target due to the genetic defects leading to neurodegenerative disorders. However, unlike traditional neuraminidase inhibitors, SAs don't directly bind to Neu1 but modulate the molecular chaperone activity of PPCA. SAs caused degradation of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation, along with decrease in membranous Neu1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SAs interacted with activated PPCA at the Neu1 binding site. Focusing on this newfound protein&#8211;protein interaction inhibition mechanism could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of amorphous nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides for Ni&#8208;Zn rechargeable aqueous battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we developed a hydrothermal method for synthesizing amorphous Ni&#8208;Co hydroxide (NC(OH)) and in the subsequent step crystalline NiCo2O4 (NCO) has been produced using water as the solvent. For nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, NC(OH) was found to have superior performance to its NCO prepared by two&#8208;step process.&#160;The XRD pattern showed mixed phases containing both Ni and Co hydroxides (during the initial step) and in the subsequent step (calcined) the formation of cubic spinel structure was noticed. For NC(OH), aggregated particles with irregular morphology were observed while clustered nanorod&#8208;like shapes were noticed for NCO samples. The nanorod morphology was obtained through a facile approach without employing any structure&#8208;directing agent. Both NC(OH) and NCO were employed as cathodes for Ni&#8208;Zn battery studies against Zn foil anode with a polyamide&#8208;based separator soaked in 6M KOH saturated with ZnO additive was used as electrolyte.&#160;The NC(OH) had a capacity of 268 mAhg&#8208;1 against 120 mAhg&#8208;1 for NCO at a current density of 1 Ag&#8208;1.&#160;The Ni&#8208;Zn battery presents energy and power densities of 428.8 WhKg&#8208;1 and 2.68 kWKg&#8208;1, respectively surpassing the normal values reported for aqueous rechargeable batteries.&#160;This work provides a facile approach&#160;for developing bimetallic hydroxides for optimal energy storage performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen Complexes as DNA Binders and Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current anticancer therapies suffer from issues such as off&#8208;target side effects and the emergence of drug resistance; therefore, the discovery of alternative therapeutic approaches is vital. These can include the development of drugs with different modes of action, and the exploration of new biomolecular targets. For the former, there has been increasing interest in drugs that are activated by an external stimulus&#160;to generate cytotoxic species. For the latter, significant efforts are being directed to explore non&#8208;canonical DNA and RNA structures (e.g. guanine&#8208;quadruplexes), as alternative biomolecular targets. Herein we report the synthesis of a library of 21 new platinum(II)&#8208;Salphen complexes, investigation of their photophysical and photochemical properties, their interactions with duplex and quadruplex DNA, and their cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells in the dark and upon light irradiation. Thanks to the intrinsic phosphorescence of the platinum(II) complexes, confocal microscopy was used for six of the complexes to determine their cellular permeability and localisation in two cancer cell lines. These studies have allowed us to identify two lead platinum(II) complexes with high guanine&#8208;quadruplex DNA affinity and selectivity, good cell permeability and nuclear localisation, and high cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells upon irradiation with no detected cytotoxicity in the dark.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mild and inexpensive copper&#8208;catalyzed aromatization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening amination and oxygenation of spiro dihydroquinazolinones are presented, respectively. These protocols provide facile and atom&#8208;economical access to the aminated and the carbonyl&#8208;containing quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones in good yields with good functional group compatibility, which are difficult to obtain by conventional methods. Remarkably, a telescoped procedure involving the condensation and the ring&#8208;opening/functionalization for simple cycloalkanone was found to be accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;regulated Formation of Metal/Metal&#8208;oxo Nodes in Two Indium Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks: Syntheses, Structures, Selective Gas Adsorption and Fluorescence Sensor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two water&#8208;stable indium metal&#8208;organic frameworks, (NH2Me2)3[In3(BTB)4]&#183;12DMA&#183;4.5H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) and (NH2Me2)9[In9O6(BTB)8(H2O)4(DMSO)4]&#183;27DMSO&#183;21H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2) (BTB = 4,4&#162;,4&#162;&#162;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzoate) with 3D interpenetrate structure has been constructed by regulating solvents. Structure analysis revealed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 has a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure with a single metal core, while In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 features an octahedron cage constructed by three kinds of metal clusters to further form a 3D structure. The fluorescence investigations show that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 are potential MOF&#8208;based fluorescent sensors to detect acetone and Fe3+ ions in EtOH or water with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, recyclability and a low detection limit. Moreover, the fluorescence mechanisms of In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 toward acetone and Fe3+ ions were further explained. In addition, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 has higher thermal and framework stability than In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. The activated In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 presents a high BET surface area of 998.82 m2g&#8208;1 and a pore size distribution of 8 to 16 &#197;. At the same time, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 exhibits high selective CO2 adsorption for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption sites and adsorption isotherms were predicted using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and the adsorption energy of the lowest&#8208;energy adsorption configuration was calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Ring Functionalization in Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclophanes on the Binding Properties Toward Nucleotides and DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular recognition of nucleobases and short sequences is an emerging research field focusing on possible applications to treat many diseases. Controlling the affinity and selectivity of synthetic receptors to target desired nucleotides or short sequences is a highly challenging task. Herein, we elucidate the effect of substituents in the phenyl ring of the anthracene&#8208;benzene azacyclophane on the recognition of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and double&#8208;stranded DNA. We show that introducing phenyl rings increases the affinity for NTPs 10&#8208;fold and implements groove and intercalation binding modes with double&#8208;stranded DNA. NMR studies and molecular modeling calculations support the ability of cyclophanes to encapsulate nucleobases as part of nucleotides.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Thioetherification of Mercaptopurine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
We disclose herein a novel and general radical approach to alkylthiopurines, encompassing 4 types of thiopurines, as well as their corresponding ribosides. This strategy is achieved through visible light&#8208;mediated late&#8208;stage functionalization of the sulfur atoms of mercaptopurines. The in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated disulfide was proposed as the pivotal neutral intermediate for this transformation. We present herein a novel photo&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8722;S bond formation for the preparation of alkylthiopurines and alkylthiopurine nucleosides. Despite the presence of reactive sites for the Minisci reaction, chemoselective S&#8208;alkylation remained the predominant pathway. This method allows for the late&#8208;stage introduction of a broad spectrum of alkyl groups onto the sulfur atom of unprotective mercaptopurine derivatives, encompassing 2&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;mercaptopurine rings. Organoborons serve as efficient and eco&#8208;friendly alkylating reagents, providing advantages in terms of readily availability, stability, and reduced toxicity. Further derivatization of the thioetherified nucleosides, together with anti&#8208;tumor assays, led to the discovery of potent anti&#8208;tumor agents with an IC50 value reaching 6.1&#8197;&#956;M (Comp. 31 for Jurkat).

         <title>Quantum Mechanical Cluster Models for Calculations on Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms: Set&#8208;Up and Accuracy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes turnover substrates into products with amazing efficiency and selectivity and as such have great potential for use in biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. However, details of their catalytic cycles and the origins surrounding the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity of enzymatic reaction processes remain unknown, which makes the engineering of enzymes and their use in biotechnology challenging. Computational modelling can assist experimental work in the field and establish the factors that influence the reaction rates and the product distributions. A popular approach in modelling is the use of quantum mechanical cluster models of enzymes that take the first&#8208; and second coordination sphere of the enzyme active site into consideration. These QM cluster models are widely applied but often the results are dependent on model choice and selection. Herein, we show that QM cluster models can produce highly accurate results that reproduce experimental product distributions and free energies of activation, regarded that large cluster models with &gt;300 atoms are used. In this tutorial review, we give general guidelines on the set&#8208;up and applications of the QM cluster method and discuss its accuracy and reproducibility. Finally, several representative QM cluster model examples on metal&#8208;containing enzymes are presented, which highlight the strength of the approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid&#8208;beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide aggregation process by more than three&#8208;fold. We synthesized a series of ortho&#8208;para and meta&#8208;para double&#8208;substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross&#8208;sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature Reduction of NOx by NH3 with Unity Conversion on Nanofilament MnO2/Activated Semi&#8208;Coke Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with NH3 at low temperatures remains a key goal for industrial applications. However, effective catalysts operating at 90 oC are rarely reported, limiting SCR scenarios to high&#8208;temperature conditions. Herein, we report a unique MnO2 nanofilament catalyst grown on activated semi&#8208;coke synthesized via a one&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal approach, which exhibits a stable and marked 100% conversion rate of NO to N2 with 100% selectivity at 90 oC, superior to the other prepared structures (nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes). Temperature&#8208;programmed desorption shows a large number of acid sites on MnO2(NFs)/ASC, benefiting the formation of NH4+ ions. Meanwhile, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals the activation of NO with O2 to form bidentate nitrate/bridging nitrate NO2 intermediates via bidentate nitrate species, triggering the Fast SCR with NH3 at low temperatures. Such an effective, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and low&#8208;cost catalyst paves a new pathway for low&#8208;temperature SCR for a wide range of application scenarios.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomistic modeling can provide insights into the design of novel catalysts in modern industries of chemistry, materials science, and biology. Classical force fields and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations have been widely adopted in molecular simulations. How&#8208; ever, these methods suffer from the drawbacks of either low accuracy or high cost. Recently, the development of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has become more and more popular as they can tackle the problems in question and can deliver rather accurate results at significantly lower computational cost. In this review, the atomistic modeling of catalytic systems with the aid of MLIPs is discussed, showcasing recently developed MLIP models and selected applications for the modeling of catalytic systems. We also highlight the best practices, and challenges for MLIPs and give an outlook for future works on MLIPs in the field of catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Attenuating Nucleophilicity of Titanocene Hydrides beyond Steric Effects en Route to Fatty Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we introduce a new class of titanocene catalysts for epoxide hydrosilylation that frustrates their hydridicity and thereby emphasizes their electron transfer reactivity. This unique attenuation of hydridicity is accomplished by introducing Lewis acidic silicon centers to the cyclopentadienyl ligands for an intramolecular coordination of the titanium bound hydride. The superiority of our rationally designed catalysts over classic titanocenes with alkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands is demonstrated in the dramatically improved regioselectivity of the hydrosilylation of monosubstituted epoxides to primary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetradentate Pt(II) complexes based on xylenylamino linked dual pyrazolate chelates for organic light emitting diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the syntheses of three Pt(II) emitters, namely, Pt4N1, Pt4N2, and Pt4N3, to which their tetradentate chelates were assembled by linking two pyrazolate chelates with a single xylenylamino entity. Functionalization of Pt4N1 was achieved upon addition of electronegative CF3 substituent on pyridinyl groups and switching to more electron deficient pyrazinyl groups in giving Pt4N2 and Pt4N3, respectively. The vertical arranged xylenylamino entity has effectively suppressed the inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interaction, as shown by the single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses. Upon fabrication of OLED devices, Pt4N2 and Pt4N3 based devices delivered efficient cyan and green emission, with an EQEmax of 15.2% and 11.2%, respectively, affirming the successfulness of the tetradentate chelating strategy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Recently, research on polyoxometalates (POMs) has gained significant momentum. Owing to their properties as electronic sponges, POMs catalyst&#160;harbor substantial potential in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery research. However, POMs undergo a transformation into reduced heteropoly blue (HPB) during electrochemical reactions, which then dissolve into the electrolyte, resulting in&#160;catalyst loss. In this research, we amalgamated 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#160;(CR6)&#160;with K3PW12O40, (KPW), synthesized a novel POM&#8208;based&#160;supramolecular compound, and integrated it with graphene oxide&#160;(GO) to fabricate a multi&#8208;functional composite polypropylene (PP) separator&#160;KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP. The crown ether array was employed to immobilize&#160;POM and construct ion transport channels, thereby enhancing the Li+&#160;migration rate and capturing polysulfides. Subsequently, leveraging the stable structure and redox properties of POM, the polysulfide is catalyzed to transform and inhibit the shuttle effect, thereby protecting the Li&#160;anode.&#160;The lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular compound&#160;separators, exhibit enhanced capacity and stability (1073.3&#160;mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 1.0&#160;C, and 81.5% retention rate after 250 cycles). The&#160;battery (S&#160;loading:&#160;3.2 mg cm&#8722;2) presents an initial specific discharge capacity of 543.4 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 0.5 C, with 89.8% of the capacity retained after 160 cycles.&#160;This&#160;underlines&#160;the practical application potential of Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular materials in Li&#8722;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Cyclopropane Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Using Thioureas as a N,N&#8208;bisnucleophile: Synthesis of Bicyclic Furo&#8208;, Pyrano&#8208;, and Pyrrololactams via a Formal [4+1]&#8208;Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal [4+1]&#8208;cycloaddition of bicyclic D&#8722;A cyclopropanes and thioureas, acting as N,N&#8208;bisnucleophiles, is developed to synthesize analogs of prevalent furolactones, i.&#8201;e. furolactams and related heterocycles.







Abstract
Fused bicyclic cyclopropanes were converted by Lewis acid&#8208;catalysis with thioureas to furo&#8208;, pyrano, and pyrrololactams with yields of up to 99&#8201;% and high diastereoselectivity. The formation of the title compounds, representing a formal [4+1]&#8208;cycloaddition to a donor&#8208;acceptor substituted cyclopropane, follows a cascade reaction involving SN1&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening addition and cyclization. Thiourea, being a cost&#8208;effective and odorless reagent, acts as an N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;nucleophile to generate bicyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;lactam moiety.

         <title>Encapsulation of Cu(II) Terpyridine Complexes into Polymeric Nanoparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of the encapsulation of a Cu(II) terpyridine complex with the polymer Pluronic F&#8208;127/Poloxamer&#8208;407 into polymeric nanoparticles for anticancer therapy is reported. The nanoparticles were able to overcome the pharmacological shortcomings of the molecular agent and induced a strong therapeutic effect in the nanomolar range.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. One of the most commonly applied therapeutic techniques to combat this disease is chemotherapy. Despite its success, the majority of clinically applied chemotherapeutic agents are associated with strong side effects and drug resistance. To overcome this limitation, much research efforts are devoted toward the development of new anticancer agents. Among the most promising class of compounds, Cu(II) complexes have emerged. Despite their strong cytotoxic effect, these agents are typically associated with low water solubility, low stability, and poor tumor selectivity. To overcome these limitations, herein, we report on the encapsulation of a promising Cu(II) terpyridine complex with the Pluronic F&#8208;127/Poloxamer&#8208;407 polymeric carrier into nanoparticles. Besides overcoming the pharmacological drawbacks, the nanoparticles were able to eradicate human breast adenocarcinoma monolayer cells as well as challenging multicellular tumor spheroids at nanomolar concentrations.

         <title>Supramolecular Complexation&#8208;Enhanced CO2 Chemisorption in Amine&#8208;Derived Sorbents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular complexation approach was developed to improve the CO2 chemisorption performance of water&#8208;lean amine sorbents. Detailed characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the supramolecular complexation between the CO2&#8208;integrated products and crown ether could stabilize the carbamic acid products, leading to improved CO2 uptake capacity and diminished energy consumption in CO2 releasing.







Abstract
A supramolecular complexation approach is developed to improve the CO2 chemisorption performance of solvent&#8208;lean amine sorbents. Operando spectroscopy techniques reveal the formation of carbamic acid in the presence of a crown ether. The reaction pathway is confirmed by theoretical simulation, in which the crown ether acts as a proton acceptor and shuttle to drive the formation and stabilization of carbamic acid. Improved CO2 capacity and diminished energy consumption in sorbent regeneration are achieved.

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfilimines via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet Energy Transfer to Sulfonyl Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel reactivity of triplet nitrenes toward sulfides to afford sulfilimines. The use of triplet nitrenes as reactive intermediates circumvented the substrate scope limitations of the prior singlet nitrene approaches, as demonstrated by broad functional group tolerance, water compatibility, and amenability to use for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs.







Abstract
Sulfilimines and their derivatives have garnered considerable interest in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Photochemical nitrene transfer to sulfides is known as a conventional synthetic approach to sulfilimines. However, the existing methods have a limited substrate scope stemming from the incompatibility of singlet nitrene intermediates with nucleophilic functional groups. Herein, we report the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl sulfilimines via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer to sulfonyl azides, uncovering the previously overlooked reactivity of triplet nitrenes with sulfides. This reaction features broad functional group tolerance, water compatibility, and amenability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Thus, this work represents an important example of energy transfer chemistry that overcomes challenges in traditional synthetic methods.

         <title>Modification of an AIE Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Polarity of Lipid Droplets Based on a series of Synthesized Aryl Naphthalizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid droplets (LDs) are subcellular organelles that are dynamic and play a central role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. They also contribute to the transport and maturation of cellular proteins and are closely associated with several diseases. The important role of the cellular microenvironment in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Changes in cell polarity, particularly in organelles, have been found to be strongly linked to inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other illnesses. It is essential to check the polarity of the LDs. A series of arylated naphthalimide derivatives were synthesized using the Suzuki reaction. Modification of synthesized aryl naphthalimides using oligomeric PEG based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. A series of fluorescent probes were designed to target LDs and detect their polarity. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high sensitivity to polarity. The addition of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the probe not only significantly improved its solubility in water, but also effectively reduced its cytotoxicity. In addition, the probe exhibited excellent aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties and solvent discolouration effects. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high Pearson correlation coefficient (0.957163) in lipid droplet co&#8208;localization in cells. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 could be used as an effective hand tool to monitor cell polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;earth Cluster&#8208;based Metal&#8211;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE = Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptation of the BaAl4 Type to Small Cations: The Case of NaGa4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;phase NaGa4 samples were prepared by annealing stoichiometric element mixtures at 200 &#176;C, 300 &#176;C, and 450 &#176;C in closed tantalum ampoules. No compositional homogeneity range was detected. While single crystals annealed at 200 &#176;C feature a fully ordered crystal structure, a crystal annealed at 300 &#176;C reveals a defect with mutual exchange of Na atoms and Ga2 dumbbells. The structure motif caused by the violation of translational symmetry resembles the CeMg2Si2 type of structure. The NaGa4 structure constitutes a branch of the BaAl4 type distinguished by a notably high c/a ratio (space group I4/mmm; a = 4.2261(1) &#197;, c = 11.2633(6) &#197;, c/a = 2.67). This distortion enables the adaption of the BaAl4&#8208;type to small cations, when the further shortening of the apical&#8211;apical distance d(Ga&#8211;Ga) is not possible any more. Therefore, NaGa4 offers an adaption alternative to the monoclinic distortion observed in the CaGa4 and YbGa4. Conductivity measurements validate the metallic behavior anticipated by NMR measurements in earlier studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual aliovalent dopants Cu, Mn engineered eco&#8208;friendly QDs for ultra&#8208;stable anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using optically active dopants tailors their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties beyond what is achieved by controlling size, shape, and composition. Herein, we synergistically modulated the optical properties of eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell QDs by incorporating Cu&#8208;doping and Mn&#8208;alloying into their core and shell to investigate their use in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. The engineered &#8220;Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe&#8221; core/shell QDs exhibit an intense bright orange photoluminescence (PL) emission centered at 606 nm, with better color purity than controlled QDs. The average PL lifetime is significantly prolonged to 201 ns, making it relevant for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. PL studies reveal that in Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe, the photophysical emission arises from the Cu state via radiative transition from the Mn 4T1 state. Integration of Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs into poly(methyl methacrylate) serves as versatile smart concealed luminescent inks for both writing and printing patterns. The features of these printed patterns using Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs persisted after 10 weeks of water&#8208;soaking and retained 70% of their PL emission intensity at 170 &#176;C, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This work provides an efficient approach to enhance both the emission and stability of eco&#8208;friendly QDs via dopant engineering for fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. As a core component, separator plays a unique yet oftentimes overlooked role in providing electrochemical stability in AZIBs. This concept focuses on the exquisite structure&#8208;property relationship of separators, highlighting three forms of these components and their structural design requirements, i.e., traditional membranes, solid&#8208;state&#160;electrolytes, and electrode coatings. The mechanism by which separators influence the zinc anode and the cathode is discussed.

         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;immolative polyglyoxylamides were synthesized with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides. They were then cross&#8208;linked by copper&#8208;assisted or strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click cycloadditions to form hydrogels that could be depolymerized on demand.







Abstract
Hydrogels are of interest for a wide range of applications. The ability to control when the hydrogel degrades can provide beneficial properties such as controlled degradation in the environment or the stimulated release of drugs or cells. Self&#8208;immolative polymers are a class of degradable polymers that undergo complete end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization upon the application of a stimulus. They have been explored for hydrogel development, but the ability to prepare and selectively degrade self&#8208;immolative hydrogels under neutral aqueous conditions has so far been limited. We describe here the preparation of water&#8208;soluble polyglyoxylamides with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides and their cross&#8208;linking to form hydrogels with 4&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol)s having unstrained and strained alkynes using copper&#8208;assisted and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click chemistry respectively. The influence of pendent azide density and solution polymer content on the resulting hydrogels was evaluated. A polyglyoxylamide with a 70&#8201;:&#8201;30 ratio of pendent hydroxyl:azide successfully provided hydrogels with compressive moduli ranging from 1.3&#8211;6.3&#8197;kPa under copper&#8208;free conditions at 10&#8211;20&#8201;% (w/w) of polymer in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Selective depolymerization and degradation of the hydrogels upon irradiation with light was demonstrated, resulting in reductions in the compressive moduli and the release of depolymerization products that were detected by NMR spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble self-immolative polyglyoxylamides were synthesized with cross-linkable pendent azides. They were then cross-linked by copper-assisted or strain-promoted azide-alkyne click cycloadditions to form hydrogels that could be depolymerized on demand.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Polymer Network Anion Exchange Membranes Based on Quaternized Polybenzoxazine and Poly(Vinyl Alcohol&#8208;Co&#8208;Ethylene) for Acid Recovery by Diffusion Dialysis</title>

Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene) exhibted excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S).







Abstract
Acid recovery from acidic waste is a pressing issue in current times. Chemical methods for recovery are not economically feasible and require significant energy input to save the environment. This study reported a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network (semi&#8208;IPN) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for acid recovery by diffusion dialysis with excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S). Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine (AQBZ) with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene), where AQBZ is obtained by Mannich reaction and Menshutkin reaction. All four proportions of semi&#8208;IPNs exhibit clear micro&#8208;phase separation, which is conducive to ion transport. The water uptake (WU) of the four semi&#8208;IPNs ranges from 14.2&#8201;% to 19.2&#8201;%, while the swelling ratio (SR) remains between 8.7&#8201;% and 11.3&#8201;%. These results indicate that the cross&#8208;linked structure in the designed semi&#8208;IPNs effectively control swelling and ensure dimensional stability. The thermal degradation temperature (Td5) of semi&#8208;IPN4:6 to semi&#8208;IPN7:3 varies from 309&#8201;&#176;C to 289&#8201;&#176;C, with an oxidation stability weight loss rate (WOX) ranging from 91.5&#8201;% to 93.5&#8201;%, demonstrating excellent thermal stability and oxidation stability. The semi&#8208;IPNs also show good UH+ values ranging from 11.9&#8211;16.3*10&#8722;3&#8197;m/h and high S values between 38.6 and 45.9, indicating the promising potential of the semi&#8208;IPNs.

         <title>Mechanochemical Diversity in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent polymer chains are known to undergo mechanochemical events when subjected to mechanical forces. Such force&#8208;coupled reactions, like C&#8208;C bond scission in homopolymers, typically occur in a non&#8208;selective manner but with a higher probability at the mid&#8208;chain. In contrast, block copolymers (BCPs), composed of two or more chemically distinct chains linked by covalent bonds, have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different mechanochemical reactivities and selectivities. These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self&#8208;assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force&#8208;sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push&#8208;Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures. The structure&#8211;property relationships are investigated through a joint experimental time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic and computational TD&#8211;DFT study. The femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8211;conversion experiments reveal ultrafast photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. This is likely the key factor leading to efficient spin&#8211;orbit CT&#8211;induced intersystem crossing for the TPA&#8211; and PTZ&#8211;derivatives as well as to small singlet&#8211;to&#8211;triplet energy gap. Consequently, evidence for a delayed fluorescence component is found together with the main prompt emission in the fluorescence kinetics both in solution and in thin film. The weight of the Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) is greatly enhanced when these fluorophores are used as guests in solid&#8211;state host matrices. TADF is interestingly revealed in the orange&#8211;red region of the visible. Such long wavelength emission is here observed with surprisingly large fluorescence quantum yields, thanks to the conjugation enhancement achieved in these newly synthesized structures relative to previous studies. Our findings may be thus promising for the future development of efficient third generation TADF&#8211;based OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spent adsorbents for recycling as catalysts have drawn considerable attention due to their environmentally benign chemistry properties. However, traditional thermocatalytic strategies limit their applications. Here, we developed an enhanced photocatalytic strategy to expand the range of their applications. A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composites (MZT) for V(V) adsorption, which were prepared using chitosan, ZrO2 and Fe3O4 by one&#8208;pot synthesis. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazole, yielding up to 89.7%. It also was implemented to photocatalysis reactions for recycle. The discolored rates of rhodamine B (RhB) were 72.3% and 97.4% by new and spent MZT, respectively. The new and spent MZT showed the forbidden bands were 251 nm and 561 nm, respectively. The result displayed spent MZT red shifted to the cyan light region. The mechanism of catalysis also has been studied in detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic [4+2] Annulation for S&#8208;Heterocycle Assembly Enabled by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) present an efficient strategy for the assembly of biorelevant heterocycles, but are thus far largely limited to toxic transition metals and rather harsh reaction conditions. In sharp contrast, we, herein report on a mild photoelectrocatalyzed CDC&#8208;[4+2] annulation enabling the synthesis of functionalized isothiochromenes enabled by a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) strategy. The transformative photoelectrocatalysis obviated toxic transition&#8208;metal, high reaction temperatures, and stoichiometric chemical redox reagents. This approach was characterized by exceedingly mild conditions, ample substrate scope, and a commercially available catalyst. Gram&#8208;scale reactions and a telescoped synthesis route reflected the unique potential in the green synthesis of important S&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

The transformative photoelectrocatalysis obviated toxic transition-metal, high reaction temperatures, and stoichiometric chemical redox reagents. This approach was characterized by exceedingly mild conditions, ample substrate scope, and a commercially available catalyst. Gram-scale reactions and a telescoped synthesis route reflected the unique potential in the green synthesis of important S-heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Functionalization of Inert C(Sp3)&#8722;H Bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to its atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy and the prevalence of C&#8722;H bonds in various organic compounds. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements of NHC&#8208;catalyzed direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling reactions, that were enabled by the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes, aiming to inspire distinct insights on the C&#8722;H functionalization by a distinct organocatalytic approach.







Abstract
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to their prevalence in various organic compounds. While conventional protocols have largely relied on transition metal catalysis, recent advancements in organocatalysis, particularly with radical NHC catalysis have sparked interest in the direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling with carbonyl moieties. This strategy involves selective cleavage of C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds to generate key carbon radicals, often achieved via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. By leveraging the bond dissociation energy (BDE) and polarity effects, HAT enables the rapid functionalization of diverse C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates, such as ethers, amines, and alkanes. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the progress in carbene organocatalytic functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds enabled by HAT processes, categorizing them into two sections: 1) C&#8722;H functionalization involving acyl azolium intermediates; and 2) functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds via reductive Breslow intermediates.

         <title>Organic Reactions Enabled by Mechanical Force&#8208;Induced Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry emerges as a sustainable, solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional synthesis, minimizing hazardous solvents and waste. This innovative field uncovers reaction pathways once considered impossible with solution&#8208;based techniques. This review seeks to encapsulate the advancements in mechanochemically triggered single electron transfer (SET) reactions involving inorganic substances, metals, polymers, and other materials over recent years.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions, achieved through milling, grinding, or other mechanical actions, have emerged as a solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Mechanochemistry not only provides the opportunity to eliminate bulk solvent use, reducing waste generation, but also unveils a new reaction strategy which enables the realization of reactions previously inaccessible in solution. While the majority of organic reactions facilitated by mechanical force traditionally follow two&#8208;electron transfer pathways similar to their solution&#8208;based counterparts, the field of mechanochemically induced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions has witnessed rapid development. This review outlines examples of mechanochemical reactions facilitated by the SET process, focusing on the reagents that initiate SET, thereby positioning mechanochemistry as a burgeoning field within the realm of single&#8208;electron chemistry.

         <title>An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Six Decades of the Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six decades of the so&#8208;called &#8220;Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis&#8221; were looked over in detail, charting the reaction set&#8208;up, mechanistic considerations and substitutions patterns, as well as the most common applications of the pyridines synthesized using the Kr&#246;hnke's method. Deviations from the standard approach are showcased, arguing the mechanistic tricks which lead to non&#8208;pyridine compounds.







Abstract
The Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis has been discovered about six decades ago (1961), by Fritz Kr&#246;hnke and Wilfried Zecher at the University of Giessen. The original method involved the reaction of &#945;&#8208;pyridinium methyl ketone salts with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of a nitrogen source, frequently ammonium acetate. Since its discovery, the Kr&#246;hnke methodology has been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;pyridines, with important applications in several research fields. Over the years, a number of modifications to the original approach have been developed and reported, enabling for the broad applicability of these methods even in modern days, also for the synthesis of non&#8208;pyridine compounds. In this critical and tutorial review, we will thoroughly explore and discuss the potential of the original method, the refinements that have been made over the years, as well as some applications arising from each type of pyridine and/or non&#8208;pyridine compounds produced by Kr&#246;hnke's approach.

Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene.

Abstract
Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo&#8208;[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene. The reaction was accompanied by a contraction of the triselenole ring to the diselenete ring. The substrate, dicyanobenzo[1,2,3]triselenole, was prepared by a new procedure via a photolytic demethylenation reaction of 3,7&#8208;diethyl[1,3]diselenolophthalonitrile using a 10&#8197;W white LED light. While triselenolosubphthalocyanine was treated by triphenylphosphine to give the diselenete derivative, the reaction of diselenetosubphthalocyanine with Woolion's reagent produced the expanded triselenole ring. The diselenete derivative reacted with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum to yield the corresponding platinum complex with Se&#8722;Pt bonds. Q&#8208;band absorption for the products appeared at around &#955;max=590&#8197;nm in the UV&#8208;vis spectrum and weak emission was observed at about &#955;e=620&#8197;nm. When diselenetosubphthalocyanine was treated with pentachloro antimonate in dichloromethane or sodium metal in hexane/tetrahydrofuran, the solution showed strong ESR signals. The structures of model compounds were optimized using the DFT method with the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G (d, p) level.

         <title>Aggregation Mechanisms and Molecular Structures of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid protein aggregation proceeds through two distinct pathways. In one pathway, misfolded proteins undergo nucleation and elongation steps ultimately forming fibrillar aggregates in the bulk solution environment. Alternatively, protein aggregation can be initiated via LLPS and LSPT steps, which further promote amyloid fibrils formation.







Abstract
Amyloid plaques are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer's disease and consist of deposits of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can undergo liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the regulatory role of LLPS in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of A&#946; oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM). The structural variations of A&#946; aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure&#8208;based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties of Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Bishomocubanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bishomocubane based energetic materials were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their applications in novel propellant formulations in rocket propulsion. Various performance parameters were assessed based on TGA&#8208;DTG analysis, BDEs, HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, ESP maps and impact sensitivity (h50). Three derivatives were found to be potential candidates with excellent ballistic performance and good stability for volume limited applications.







Abstract
The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were in the range of 1.30&#8211;1.59&#8197;g/cm3. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Three compounds, a dinitroazide (Isp,vac=310.98&#8197;s), a dinitrate (Isp,vac=309.51&#8197;s), and a dinitronitrate (Isp,vac=309.20s) were found to be excellent candidates for volume limited applications.

         <title>Functionalization of Alginate Hydrogels with a Multifunctional Peptide Supports Mesenchymal Stem Cell Adhesion and Reduces Bacterial Colonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the functionalization of an alginate hydrogel with a tailor&#8208;made multifunctional peptide containing the cell adhesive RGD motif and the LF1&#8211;11 antibacterial peptide. Such novel multifunctional biomaterial ensures the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells, enhances ALP activity and decreases bacterial infections of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models.







Abstract
Hydrogels with cell adhesive moieties stand out as promising materials to enhance tissue healing and regeneration. Nonetheless, bacterial infections of the implants represent an unmet major concern. In the present work, we developed an alginate hydrogel modified with a multifunctional peptide containing the RGD cell adhesive motif in combination with an antibacterial peptide derived from the 1&#8211;11 region of lactoferrin (LF). The RGD&#8208;LF branched peptide was successfully anchored to the alginate backbone by carbodiimide chemistry, as demonstrated by 1H NMR and fluorescence measurements. The functionalized hydrogel presented desirable physicochemical properties (porosity, swelling and rheological behavior) to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. The viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the peptide&#8208;functionalized hydrogels was excellent, with values higher than 85&#8201;% at day 1, and higher than 95&#8201;% after 14&#8197;days in culture. Moreover, the biological characterization demonstrated the ability of the hydrogels to significantly enhance ALP activity of MSCs as well as to decrease bacterial colonization of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models. Such results prove the potential of the functionalized hydrogels as novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, simultaneously displaying cell adhesive activity and the capacity to prevent bacterial contamination, a dual bioactivity commonly not found for these types of hydrogels.

         <title>Precisely Designed Ultra&#8208;Small CoP Nanoparticles&#8208;Decorated Hollow Carbon Nanospheres as Highly Efficient Host in Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling the size of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) is crucial for the development of TMPs&#8208;based efficient host materials for Li&#8722;S batteries. With the help of the spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB), ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticle&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) were synthesized. The CoP@C/S electrode delivered a stable specific discharge capacity due to the suppressed &#8216;&#8216;shuttle&#8217;&#8217; effect and fast reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Designing porous carbon materials with metal phosphides as host materials holds promise for enhancing the cyclability and durability of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries by mitigating sulfur poisoning and exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, it is urgent to precisely control the size of metal phosphides to further optimize the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, a subtlety regulation strategy was proposed to obtain ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticles&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) by using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) as the template with stabilizing assistance from polydopamine coating, which also works as carbon source. Leveraging the electrostatic interaction between SPB and Co2+, ultra&#8208;small Co particles with sizes measuring 5.5&#177;2.6&#8197;nm were endowed after calcination. Subsequently, through a gas&#8208;solid phosphating process, these Co particles were converted into CoP nanoparticles with significantly finer sizes (7.1&#177;3.1&#8197;nm) compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches. By uniformly distributing the electrocatalyst nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanospheres, CoP@C facilitated the acceleration of Li&#8208;ion diffusion and enhanced the conversion reaction kinetics of polysulfides through adsorption&#8208;diffusion synergy. As a result, Li&#8722;S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8201;C, with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle.

         <title>Direct Access to Benzolactams and Benzolactones via Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylation with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactams and lactones are obtained in convenient manner via Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction with CO2. The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling engages AlCl3 as a key additive and its multiple roles are elucidated via a dedicated computational investigation.







Abstract
A new nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling for accessing &#947;&#8208;lactams (isoindolinones) as well as &#947;&#8208;lactones (isobenzofuranones) via carbonylation with CO2 is documented. The protocol exploits the synergistic role of redox&#8208;active Ni(II) complexes and AlCl3 as a CO2 activator/oxygen scavenger, leading to the formation of a wide range of cyclic amides and esters (28 examples) in good to high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). A dedicated computational investigation revealed the multiple roles played by AlCl3. In particular, the simultaneous transient protection of the pendant amino group of the starting reagents and the formation of the electrophilically activated CO2&#8208;AlCl3 adduct are shown to concur in paving the way for an energetically favorable mechanistic pathway.

&lt;p&gt;Lactams and lactones are obtained in convenient manner via Ni-catalyzed carbonylation reaction with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The cross-electrophile coupling engages AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a key additive and its multiple roles are elucidated via a dedicated computational investigation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new nickel catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling for accessing &#947;-lactams (isoindolinones) as well as &#947;-lactones (isobenzofuranones) via carbonylation with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is documented. The protocol exploits the synergistic role of redox-active Ni(II) complexes and AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activator/oxygen scavenger, leading to the formation of a wide range of cyclic amides and esters (28 examples) in good to high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). A dedicated computational investigation revealed the multiple roles played by AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, the simultaneous transient protection of the pendant amino group of the starting reagents and the formation of the electrophilically activated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adduct are shown to concur in paving the way for an energetically favorable mechanistic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Cobalt(II) Complex for Chemoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;Formyl Indoles from Amino Alcohols and Alcohols&#8224;</title>

This report describes synthesis of an cobalt (II) complex (C1) of N&#8208;((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylselanyl)ethan amine (L1). The cobalt complex was used as catalyst for a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction between 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoaryl)ethanols and benzyl alcohols. Interestingly, chemoselective formation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindoles was observed instead of N&#8208;alkylated or C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles which was observed in earlier reports. The mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through tandem imine formation followed by the cyclization.







Abstract
An air&#8208;stable, inexpensive, and isolable cobalt(II) complex (C1) of N&#8208;((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylselanyl)ethan amine (L1) was synthesized and characterized. The complex was used to catalyze a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction between 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)ethanols and benzyl alcohol derivatives. Interestingly, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindole derivatives were formed instead of N&#8208;alkylated or C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles. A broad substrate scope can be activated using this protocol with only 5.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading to achieve up to 87&#8201;% yield of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindole derivatives.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones Initiated by Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Metathesis</title>

The cooperative Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables a multicomponent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones from 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water, in which a highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl cross metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes has been developed and suggested as the initial step of the annulation.







Abstract
The cooperative Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis makes convergent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones through a three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water. Control experiments support that Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes and alkyl glyoxylates might be the initial step of this multicomponent annulation. Further chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydration of the alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis product and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition promoted by Br&#248;nsted acid results in the formation of two C&#8722;O bonds of the five&#8208;membered oxygen heterocycle.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Robust Spiro [Fluorene&#8208;9] CAAC Ruthenium Alkylidene Complexes for the &#8220;One&#8208;Pot&#8221; Conversion of Allyl Acetate to Butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of spiro [fluorene&#8208;9] CAAC Ru complexes was prepared. The dynamic properties and activities of molecular catalysts were tuned with smart design and tailoring. In addition to their high metathesis activity, these new compounds also proved to be excellent hydrogenation catalysts, which allowed the one&#8208;pot production of 1,4&#8208;butanediol, a key compound in the synthesis of biodegradable polymers.







Abstract
A series of a novel CAAC ligands featuring a spiro&#8208;fluorene group have been synthesized and complexed with ruthenium alkylidenes, yielding the corresponding Hoveyda&#8208;type derivatives as a new family of olefin metathesis catalysts. The novel complexes have been characterized by XRD, HRMS and NMR measurements. The synthetised complexes were tested in catalysis and showed good activity in olefin metathesis, as demonstrated on diethyl diallylmalonate and allyl acetate substrates. The unique backbone in the ligand with the large, yet inflexible condensed system renders interesting properties to the catalyst, exemplified by the good catalytic performance and improved Z&#8208;selectivity. In addition, the complex can also serve as a hydrogenation catalyst in a consecutive (one&#8208;pot) reaction. The latter reaction can convert allyl acetate to butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, a valuable chemical intermediate for biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS).

         <title>Spatially Resolved Multicolor Luminescence Tuning on the Single 1D Heterogeneous Microrod</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially resolved 1D heterogeneous microrods that emit variable emission on demand in response to excitation pulse width were developed. This kind of well&#8208;designed 1D heterogeneous microrods can carry a variety of optical features and show great potential in fabricating unclonable anti&#8208;counterfeiting tags.







Abstract
The spatially resolvable multicolored microrods have potential applications in many fields. However, achieving spatially resolved multicolor luminescence tuning on the microrod with a fixed composition remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a strategy is proposed that allows for the tuning of spatially resolved, multicolored upconversion (UC) luminescence (UCL) along a 1D heterogeneous microrod by modifying the pulse width of an external laser. NaYbF4:1&#8201;% Ho is identified as an UCL color&#8208;adjustable material, exhibiting pulse width&#8208;dependent multicolored UCL, resulting in a significant regulation of the red/green (R/G) ratio from 0.1 to 10.3 as the pulse width is varied from 0.1 to 10&#8197;ms. Such variability can be ascribed to differences in the number of photons incident upon the microrod throughout the period necessary for the UC process to occur. Additionally, NaYbF4:1&#8201;%Tm and NaYF4:20&#8201;%Yb,1&#8201;%Ho are employed as materials that emit blue and green light, respectively, with their UCL colors largely unaffected by changes in the pulse width. Subsequently, a tip&#8208;modified epitaxial growth method is utilized to integrate both UCL color&#8208;adjustable and non&#8208;adjustable segments within the same microrod. Comparing with single&#8208;color or fixed multicolor microrods, our developed multisegmented emissive color adjustable 1D heterogeneous microrods have unique optical characteristics and can carry more optical information.

         <title>Glyco&#8208;DNA: Enzymatic Synthesis of Base&#8208;Modified and Hypermodified DNA Displaying up to Four Different Monosaccharide Units in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugared DNA displaying up to four different glycosides in the major groove has been prepared by DNA polymerase catalyzed primer extension using four different carbohydrate&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates.







Abstract
A portfolio of six modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) derivatives derived from 5&#8208;substituted pyrimidine or 7&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;deazapurine bearing different carbohydrate units (d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;mannose, l&#8208;fucose, sialic acid and N&#8722;Ac&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine) tethered through propargyl&#8208;glycoside linker was designed and synthesized via the Sonogashira reactions of halogenated dNTPs with the corresponding propargyl&#8208;glycosides. The nucleotides were found to be good substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic primer extension and PCR synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA displaying up to four different sugars. Proof of concept binding study of sugar&#8208;modified oligonucleotides with concanavalin A showed positive effect of avidity and sugar units count.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Terpenoid Alkaloid&#8211;Like Compounds Containing Medium&#8208;Sized Rings via Reconstruction of the Humulene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a library of terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compounds with diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing ring systems. Our strategy involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom into a humulene skeleton and subsequent ring reconstruction. A tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assay using a receptor activator of nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B ligand (RANKL)&#8208;induced RAW264.7 cells allowed identifying a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases.







Abstract
The construction of a chemical library based on natural products is a promising method for the synthesis of natural product&#8208;like compounds. In this study, we synthesized a terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library based on the humulene skeleton. Our strategy, which enables access to diverse ring systems such as 11&#8208;membered monocyclic, oxabicyclic, and medium&#8208;sized aza ring&#8208;containing scaffolds, involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom, an intermolecular C&#8722;O bond formation via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated epoxide&#8208;opening transannulation, and a ring&#8208;reconstruction strategy based on olefin metathesis. A cheminformatics analysis based on their structural and physicochemical properties revealed that the synthesized compounds have high three&#8208;dimensionality and high natural product likeness scores but with structural novelty. The usefulness of the terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library for drug discovery and the accessibility to structure&#8208;activity relationship studies were validated by performing an assay for osteoclast&#8208;specific tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase activity, resulting in the identification of a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases such as osteoporosis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation at sp3&#8208;Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic allylations have emerged as versatile processes for assembling C&#8722;C or C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Traditionally, noble transition metals like Pd, Rh, or Ir have been extensively employed for these processes. However, recent sustainable catalytic strategies have shifted towards utilizing base metals as catalysts. Consequently, this review outlines the breakthroughs in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations, emphasizing their noteworthy advancements in the field.







Abstract
The rising demand and financial costs of noble transition metal catalysts have emphasized the need for sustainable catalytic approaches. Over the past few years, base&#8208;metal catalysts have emerged as ideal candidates to replace their noble&#8208;metal counterparts because of their abundance and easiness of handling. Despite the significant advancements achieved with precious transition metals, earth&#8208;abundant cobalt catalysts have emerged as efficient alternatives for allylic substitution reactions. In this review, allylic alkylations at sp3&#8208;carbon centers mediated by cobalt will be discussed, with a special focus on the mechanistic features, scope, and limitations.

         <title>Organoboron Polymorphs with Different Molecular Packing Modes for Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron&#160;compounds offer&#160;a&#160;new strategy to design optoelectronic materials with high fluorescence efficiency. In this paper,&#160;the&#160;organoboron compound B&#8208;BNBP with double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine bearing four fluorine atoms as core unit is facilely synthesized and exhibits&#160;a&#160;narrowband&#160;emission spectrum and a high photoluminescence quantum yield&#160;(PLQY)&#160;of 86.53% in solution. Its polymorphic&#160;crystals&#160;were controllable prepared by different solution self&#8208;assembly methods. Two microcrystals possess different molecular packing modes, one&#8208;dimensional microstrips (1D&#8208;MSs) for H&#8208;aggregation and two&#8208;dimensional microdisks (2D&#8208;MDs) for J&#8208;aggregation, owing to&#160;abundant intermolecular interactions of four fluorine atoms sticking out conjugated plane. Their structure&#8208;property relationships were investigated by crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculation. Strong emission spectra with the full width at half maximum (FWHM)&#160;of less than 30&#160;nm can also&#160;be&#160;observed in thin film and 2D&#8208;MDs. 1D&#8208;MSs possess thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#160;property and exhibit superior optical waveguide performance with an optical loss of 0.061 dB/&#956;m. This work enriches the diversity of polymorphic microcrystals&#160;and further reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship in organoboron&#160;micro/nano&#8208;crystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;sensitized CO2 Methanation along a Relaxed Heat Available Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photocatalysis, the resulted heat by the relaxation of most of incident light no longer acts as the industrially favorite driving force back to the target photo&#8208;reaction due to more or less the negative relation between photocatalytic efficiency and temperature. Here, we reported a visible light&#8208;sensitized protocol that completely reversed the negatively temperature&#8208;dependent efficiency in photo&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with saturated water vapor. Uniform Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/PDI self&#8208;assembly material decisively injects the excited electron of PDI sensitizer into N&#8208;TiO2 forming Ti&#8208;H hydride which is crucially temperature&#8208;dependent nucleophilic species to dominate CO2 methanation, rather than conventionally separated and trapped electrons on the conductor band. Meanwhile, the ternary composite lifts itself temperature from room temperature to 305.2 &#176;C within 400s only by the failure excitation upon simulated sunlight of 2.5 W/cm2, and smoothly achieves CO2 methanation with a record number of 4.98 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 rate, compared to less than 0.02 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at classic Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/UV photocatalysis without PDI sensitization. This approach can reuse ~53.9% of the relaxed heat energy from the incident light thereby allow high&#8208;intensity incident light as strong as possible within a flowing photo&#8208;reactor, opening the most likely gateways to industrialization.</dc:description>

This approach can reuse ~53.9% of the relaxed heat energy from the incident light thereby allow high-intensity incident light as strong as possible within a flowing photo-reactor, opening the most likely gateways to industrialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Active Immobilized Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization: Neutral Single Site Y(III) Complex Bearing Bulky Silylallyl Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring the surface organometallic chemistry on silica of highly electrophilic yttrium complexes is a relatively uncommon endeavor, particularly when focusing on tris&#8208;alkyl complexes characterized by Y&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;alkyl bonds. A drawback with this class of complexes once grafted on silica, is the frequent occurrence of alkyl transfer by ring opening of siloxane groups, resulting in a mixture of species. Herein, we employed a more stable homoleptic yttrium allyl complex bearing bulky &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl ligand to limit this transfer reaction. This strategy has been validated by comparing the reactivity between [Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] and [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] with SiO2&#8208;700, where the undesired alkyl transfer reaction occurred for [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] leading to a bipodal [(&#8801;SiO)2Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)] as major surface species, 2, while [Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] resulted selectively in a monopodal species, [(&#8801;SiO)Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}2], 1. The materials obtained were characterized by DRIFT, solid state NMR, mass balance analysis and EXAFS. Catalyst 1 showed high activity compared to 2 in ethylene polymerization. The catalytic performance of this neutral catalyst 1 was extended to pre&#8208;industrial scale in the presence of hydrogen and 1&#8208;hexene. An unprecedented activity, up to 7400 gPE&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 was obtained even with very low concentration of scavenger AliBu3 (TIBA/Y = 1.2). The obtained HDPE exhibited desired spherical particle morphology with broad molar mass distribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic&#8208;Structure Interpretation: How Much Do We Understand Ce L3 XANES?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides a brief overview of how Ce L3 XANES spectroscopy, especially in HERFD mode, can be utilized to investigate the electronic structure in cerium systems in a highly sophisticated manner. It addresses key questions relevant to chemists, material scientists and physicists, particularly regarding the oxidation state, ground&#8208;state configuration, electron occupation, and local structure near the Ce atom.







Abstract
Historically, cerium has been attractive for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. The cerium atom has the unique ability to cycle between two chemical states (Ce(III) and Ce(IV)) and drastically adjust its electronic configuration: [Xe] 4f15d16s2 in response to a chemical reaction. Understanding how electrons drive chemical reactions is an important topic. The most direct way of probing the chemical and electronic structure of materials is by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) or X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) in high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) mode. Such measurements at the Ce L3 edge have the advantage of a high penetration depth, enabling in&#8208;situ reaction studies in a time&#8208;resolved manner and investigation of material production or material performance under specific conditions. But how much do we understand Ce L3 XANES? This article provides an overview of the information that can be extracted from experimental Ce L3 XAS/XANES/HERFD data. A collection of XANES data recorded on various cerium systems in HERFD mode is presented here together with detailed discussions on data analysis and the current status of spectral interpretation, including electronic structure calculations.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Hydrothermal&#8208;Derived rGO/MXene/Sulfur Composite Aerogels as Free&#8208;Standing Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
The confinement and high utilization of sulfur in the cathodes is critical for improved cycling performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this case one&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle. The excellent cycling performance is correlated with highly oxidized MXene and in&#8197;situ formed sulfate/thiosulfate complex layer in the long&#8208;term cycles.

         <title>A Simply Synthesized Shaking&#8208;induced Small Molecule System with Repeatable and Instantaneous Discoloration Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simply&#8208;synthesized small molecule solution system with repeatable and instantaneous force&#8208;related discoloration response (from yellowish to dark green) is attributed to accelerated generation of ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical under shaking.







Abstract
Force&#8208;related discoloration materials are highly valuable because of their characteristics of visualization, easy operation, and environment friendliness. Most force&#8208;related discoloration materials focus on polymers and depend on bond scission, which leads to insensitivity and unrecoverable. Small&#8208;molecule systems based on well&#8208;defined molecular structures and simple composition with high sensitivity would exhibit considerable mechanochromic potential. However, to date, researches about force&#8208;related discoloration materials based on small molecule solution remain limited and are rarely reported. In this study, we developed a repeatable and instantaneous discoloration small molecule solution system by simple one&#8208;pot synthesis method. It exhibited an instantaneous chromic change from yellowish to dark green under shaking and reverting back to yellow within 1&#8197;minute after removal of the shaking. Experimental results confirmed that the discoloration mechanism is attributed to the oscillation accelerating the production of unstable ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical. The newly developed shaking&#8208;induced discoloration small molecule system (SDSMS) promises in field of mechanical force sensing and optical encryption.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The absorbent expansion elastomer plays a crucial role in engineering sealing and holds a promising future in this field as infrastructure continues to develop. Traditional materials have their limitations, especially when used in large construction projects where the integrity and reliability of the material are of utmost importance. In this work, a self&#8208;healing water&#8208;absorbing expansion elastomer was developed for continuous production at a large scale to monitor the sealing conditions of massive infrastructure projects. At room temperature, the material exhibited a repairing efficiency of 57.77% within 2 h, which increased to 84.02% after 12 h. This extended reaction time allowed for effective repairs when defects were detected. The material's strength reached approximately 3 MPa, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The volume expansion rate of the material reached 200&#8208;400% for effective sealing, and the fictionalization of the packing made it have a good external force sensing effect and prevent heat build&#8208;up effect. The conductive detection performance of the absorbent expansion elastomer was improved by utilizing triple self&#8208;healing strategies, including dipole&#8208;dipole interaction, ion cross&#8208;linked network, and externally&#8208;aided restoration materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonamide&#8208;Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine&#8208;Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a novel type of fluorine&#8208;lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide&#8208;sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost&#8208;efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end&#8208;groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4&#8208;fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from Tg = 151&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non&#8208;swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963; = 283 mS cm&#8208;1 at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems. This approach can pave the way to a novel type of ion conducting class in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Photoactivation of Anionophores by Using Redshifted Fast&#8208;Relaxing Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;regulated transmembrane ionophores enable spatial and temporal control over activity, offering promise as targeted therapeutics. Key to such applications is control using bio&#8208;compatible visible light. Herein, we report red&#8208;shifted azobenzene&#8208;derived synthetic anionophores that use amber or red light to trigger (E)&#8208;(Z) photoisomerisation and activation of transmembrane chloride transport. We demonstrate that by tuning the thermal half&#8208;life of the more active, but thermodynamically unstable, Z isomer to relax on the timescale of minutes, transient activation of ion transport can be achieved by activating with solely with visible light and deactivating by thermal relaxation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diversity and Evolution of Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number and complexity of chiral Br&#248;nsted acids are dramatically increasing, ultimately leading to unique generations of catalysts with enhanced reaction capabilities. In this concept article, we discuss how the approach to optimizing these structures have transitioned from foundational structural tuning to a function&#8208;driven approach.







Abstract
The chemical space of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts is defined by quantity and complexity, reflecting the diverse synthetic challenges confronted and the innovative molecular designs introduced. Here, we detail how this successful outcome is a powerful demonstration of the benefits of utilizing both local structure searches and a comprehensive understanding of catalyst performance for effective and efficient exploration of Br&#248;nsted acid properties. In this concept article we provide an evolutionary overview of this field by summarizing the approaches to catalyst optimization, the resulting structures, and functions.

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Arynes with Silanes and Silicon&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various silanes as well as organosilicon polymer PHMS can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Mechanism research showed that the hydrosililation reaction probably underwent a synergistic pathway.







Abstract
Benzyne derived from hexadehydrogenated Diels Alder (HDDA) reactions was found to be an efficient hydrosilylation acceptors. Various silanes can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Polyhydromethylsiloxane (PHMS), a widely used organosilicon polymer, was also successfully modified using our method. About 5&#8201;% of Si&#8722;H bonds in the polymer were inserted by benzynes, giving a functional PHMS with much more solubility in methanol and with a blue&#8208;emitting fluorescence behavior. Mechanism research shows that the insertion of benzyne into the Si&#8722;H bond probably undergoes a synergistic pathway, which is quite different from the traditional radical&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.

         <title>Pyridinethiolate&#8208;Capped CdSe Quantum Dots for Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2 Production in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots that show the feasibility of harvesting red&#8208;light for H2 production. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free system lasts over 240&#8197;hour and realizes a turnover number of 43910. Triplet quantum yield of quantum dot is a key factor promoting the catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of low&#8208;energy sunlight to produce renewable fuels is a subject of great interest. Here we report the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) capped with a pyridinethiolate carboxylic acid (pyS&#8208;COOH) for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production in water. The precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free system is robust over 240&#8197;h, and achieves a turnover number (TON) of 43910&#177;305 (vs Ni) with a rate of 31570&#177;1690&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for hydrogen production. In contrast to the inactive QDs capped with other thiolate ligands, the CdSe&#8208;pyS&#8208;COOH QDs give a significantly higher singlet oxygen quantum yield [&#934;&#916; (1O2)] in solution.

Here we report the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) capped with a pyridinethiolate carboxylic acid (pyS-COOH) for red-light-driven H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in water. The precious-metal-free system is robust over 240&#8197;h, and achieves a turnover number (TON) of 43910&#177;305 (vs Ni) with a rate of 31570&#177;1690&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for hydrogen production. In contrast to the inactive QDs capped with other thiolate ligands, the CdSe-pyS-COOH QDs give a significantly higher singlet oxygen quantum yield [&#934;&lt;sub&gt;&#916;&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide&#8208;Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups are paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents with highly shifted and intense CEST peaks due, in part, to the trans&#8208;orientation about the amide C&#8722;N bond. These Co(II) paramagnetic shift agents have reduced overall charge for higher loading into liposomes for lipoCEST studies.







Abstract
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non&#8208;coordinating benzyl groups and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single cis&#8208;pendant isomer with both amide protons in the trans&#8208;configuration, as supported by an X&#8208;ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the trans&#8208;1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z&#8208;spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly&#8208;shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40&#8197;mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically&#8208;induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3&#8197;ppm. Addition of the amphiphilic 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;based complex Co(L5) to the liposomal bilayer at 18&#8197;mM with Co(L1) encapsulated in the liposome at 50&#8197;mM changes the sign and increases the magnitude of the saturation frequency offset to &#8722;7.5&#8197;ppm at 300 mOsm/L.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Ultrafast Synthesis of Bimetallic Nickel&#8208;Cobalt Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Application in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

MOFs are good precursors for active mixed&#8208;metal oxide/hydroxide electrocatalysts, with a uniform distribution of metals at the nanoscale. The catalytic properties of materials from monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs with benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) are investigated in direct comparison. A MOF nanosheet was for the first time obtained on Ni foam through microwave&#8208;heating.







Abstract
Herein, a series of monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs of formula M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M&#8217;)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, (M, M&#8217;=metal) with the same pillar and layer linkers 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave&#8208;assisted thermal conversion synthesis method (MW) within only 12&#8197;min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M&#8217; was 4&#8201;:&#8201;1. The mono&#8208; and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic&#8208;activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among all tested bimetallic MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, the NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301&#8197;mV and Tafel slopes of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 on a rotating disk glassy carbon electrode (RD&#8208;GCE) in 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, NiCoMOF was insitu grown in just 25&#8197;min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) with, for example, a mass loading of 16.6 mgMOF/gNF, where overpotentials of 313 and 328&#8197;mV at current densities of 50 and 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, were delivered and superior long&#8208;term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement (Rfar=2 &#937;), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite. During the electrocatalytic processes or even before upon KOH pre&#8208;treatment, the MOFs are transformed to the mixed&#8208;metal hydroxide phase &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 which presents the active species in the reactions (turnover frequency TOF=0.252&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 320&#8197;mV). Compared to the TOF from &#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 (0.002&#8197;s&#8722;1), our study demonstrates that a bimetallic MOF improves the electrocatalytic performance of the derived catalyst by giving an intimate and uniform mixture of the involved metals at the nanoscale.

         <dc:description>Shape control has been a major theme of nanocrystal research in terms of synthesis, property tailoring, and optimization of performance in a variety of applications. Among the possible shapes, bipyramids are unique owing to their symmetry, planar defects, and exposed facets. In this article, we focus on the colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals featuring a triangular bipyramidal shape, together with highlights of their properties and applications. We start with a brief discussion of the general classification and requirements for the nucleation and growth of bipyramidal nanocrystals, followed by specific aspects regarding the synthetic methods with a focus on the roles of reduction, etching, and capping, as well as controls of facet, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation. In the end, we illustrate how these aspects affect the properties of bipyramidal nanocrystals for plasmonic and catalytic applications, together with future perspectives.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>. We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state, . As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance,, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5f electron participation and coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in On&#8208;line Mass Spectrometry Toolbox for Mechanistic Studies of Organic Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reactions are very complex and involve a variety of physicochemical processes. Accurate and systematic monitoring of intermediate process changes during the reaction is essential for understanding the mechanism of electrochemical reactions and is the basis for rational design of new electrochemical reactions. On&#8208;line electrochemical analysis based on mass spectrometry (MS) has become an important tool for studying electrochemical reactions. This technique is based on different ionization and sampling means and realizes on&#8208;line analysis of electrochemical reactions by establishing electrochemistry&#8208;MS (EC&#8208;MS) coupling devices. In particular, it provides key evidence for elucidating the reaction mechanism by capturing and identifying the reactive reaction intermediates. This review will categorize various EC&#8208;MS devices and the organic electrochemical reaction systems they study, highlighting the latest research progress in recent years. It will also analyze the properties of various devices and look forward to the future development of EC&#8208;MS.</dc:description>

         <title>What determines the Lewis acidity of a bismuthane? Towards Bi&#8208;based FLPs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8213;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8208;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8213;C) orbital.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzodifuranone Crystals with Solid&#8208;State Emission Arising from the Introduction of Bulky Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon introducing bulky aromatic groups into benzodifuranone derivatives, crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission were obtained. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the emissive properties should most likely be attributed to the absence of stacking between the dye scaffolds. In addition to the solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed responsivity to external stimuli, i.e., luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials. Here, we have further developed a bioinspired methodology for the formation of aqueous nanotubes of well&#8208;defined dimensions and pore coating through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles that are chemically programmed with complementary nucleobases. These nanotubes are endowed with a hydrophobic lumen, whose diameter can be expanded as a function of the monomer length, in which apolar dyes can be efficiently encapsulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36 V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption energy (&#8208;2.85 eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8208;1.80 eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential H/D Exchanges Resulting from Rollover&#8208;Cyclometallation during Photoirradiation of Rhodium(III) Complex in Methanol&#8208;d4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the photoreaction of newly prepared bis(6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)(oxalato)rhodium(III) ([Rh(N^N)2(ox)]+) in CD3OD. Photoirradiation of this complex causes the dissociation of ox, followed by the formation of the unprecedented Rh(III) complex with Rh&#8211;H and Rh&#8211;C s bonds, [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (C^N = [6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8242;). This hydride formation and cyclometallation spontaneously proceed owing to the conflict between the steric hindrance arising from the methyl groups of N^N and the driving force for the structural change due to [Rh(N^N)2]+ formation. Although [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ is initially converted to [Rh(N^N)2]+ by photoirradiation, it is immediately regenerated by the rollover cyclometallation of the [Rh(N^N)2]+ complex. [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ undergoes H/D exchange for the H atoms in the Rh&#8211;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8242;&#8208;positions of the N^N ligand during the photoirradiation. DFT calculations predict with reasonable certainty the spontaneous structural change of [Rh(N^N)2]+ to [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ and the subsequent photodriven Rh&#8211;C bond rupture leading to the formation of [Rh(N^N)2]+ accompanied by H/D exchange reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Functional Applications of Precision Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science&#8212;a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8208;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8208;water H&#8208;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of BODIPY and Bis(BF2) Chromophores by Using Arylazosulfones in a Sunflow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPYs have a well&#8208;established role in biological sciences as chemosensors and versatile biological markers due to their chemical reactivity, which allows for fine&#8208;tuning of their photophysical characteristics. In this work, we combined the unique reactivity of arylazo sulfones with the advantages of a &#8220;sunflow&#8221; reactor to develop a fast, efficient, and versatile method for the photochemical arylation of BODIPYs and other chromophores. This approach resulted in red&#8208;shifted emitting fluorophores due to extended electronic delocalization at the 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of the BODIPY core. This method represents an advantageous approach for BODIPY functionalization compared to existing strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>The Journey for the Synthesis of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of higher acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ reconstructured alloy nanosheets heterojunction for highly selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35 mA cm&#8208;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction. Cu6Sn5 nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu2O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction is a sustainable and atom&#8208;economical methodology in organic synthesis, resulting in the byproducts of only hydrogen or water. Herein, a robust Co&#8208;Si/CN catalyst (derived from ZIF@SiO2 composite) has been synthesized through a one&#8208;step assembly process via pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst has been employed for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols, enabling efficient conversion of various substrates into desired quinoline or pyridine derivatives with a yield of up to 94%</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ce(IV) Heteroleptic Double&#8208;Decker Complex with a New Helical Naphthalocyanine as a Potential Gearing Subunit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16% yield.</dc:description>
