         <title>Tuning peptide structure and function through fluorobenzene stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides was developed. This enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with  ortho  ,  meta  or  para  relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant difference in potency and efficacy demonstrates how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n = 6, 4, and 2): Focusing on the effect of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C 18  ) precursors, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), are studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It is found that C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8208;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960; out  and &#960; in  ) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C 18  . However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) compared to C 18  . Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960; in  system, and the &#960; out  system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) with larger n  shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960; out  electron delocalization in the C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) and C 18  in terms of gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 4 and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120 &#181;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200 &#181;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method for studying enzyme&#8208;ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>An alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;Ru(II) polypyridine complex for targeted antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize clinical application of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), one of the most arduous challenges is how to render aPDT agents a high selectivity against bacterial pathogens. In light of the fact that amino group&#8208;containing lipids are rich on the outer surfaces of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, we herein constructed an alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;ruthenium (II) polypyridine complex (  Ru2  ) to preferentially label  Staphylococcus aureus  and methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) over mammalian cells via the amino&#8208;yne bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Thanks to the strong singlet oxygen generation ability,  Ru2  could photo&#8208;inactivate  S. aureus  and MRSA effectively and specifically. phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules also exist in mammalian cells but are not accessible for  Ru2  , leading to its poor binding/uptake and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark and upon irradiation towards mammalian cells as well as low hemolysis, all favorable for aPDT application.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 3  10  helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. Yet, the screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus.  1  H and  19  F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their  N  &#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 3  10  &#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle  19  F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Ylide&#8208;stabilized phosphenium cations: Impact of the substitution pattern on the coordination chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Here, we report the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]  +  (with Y = Ph  3  PC(Ph), R = Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties. While the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y  2  P]  +  formed the expected LAuCl]  +  complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@hydrogel system for antibacterial therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Here, we propose an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained&#8208;release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) was loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8211;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on utilizing two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activity for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. While bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced utilizing dual ligands in the whole   domino  process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assemblies with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent supramolecular assembly systems with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties for the detection of analytes including metal ions, anions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and heparin are summarized according to their unique architectures, diverse functions, outstanding sensitivity, and excellent selectivity as sensing platforms. Furthermore, the additional advantages of the marriage between supramolecular assemblies and AIE features are highlighted, and opportunities, challenges, and development perspectives of the particular combination are also discussed.







Abstract
The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.

         <title>Understanding the Effects of Binders in Gas Sorption and Acidity of Aluminium Fumarate Extrudates</title>

         <dc:description>
A pinch of binder, a pinch of MOF: The effect of co&#8208;extruding aluminium fumarate with either clays or silica gel binders has been investigated. Textural, microscopic, and spectroscopic techniques show the changes in porosity and surface sites, and CO2 and CH4 adsorption isotherms fitted an ideal Jensen&#8208;Seaton adsorption model. We have demonstrated the viability of extrusion for MOF extrudate formation and the changes associated to the process.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminium fumarate MOF with clays or SiO2 gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO2 selectivity towards CH4, of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process. Moreover, probe FTIR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF-containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminium fumarate MOF with clays or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity towards CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process. Moreover, probe FTIR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Think globally, act locally: The trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of aromaticity is demonstrated for a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic furans of various sizes. Whereas smaller macrocycles are planar, larger macrocycles distort out of planarity, thereby avoiding global antiaromaticity, and display increasing character of local aromaticity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by O. Gidron et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103536).

         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding is a fundamental interaction in daily life and plays an important role in chemical, physical, and biochemical processes. This work presents a metastable acid&#8211;base crystalline material whose luminescence color varies between green and yellow depending on the strength of the hydrogen bonds. The two single crystal structures shown were revealed in detail by neutron structural analysis and modern computational chemistry. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Ono, Y. Hisaeda, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103044).

         <title>Z&#8208;scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction for boosting photo&#8208;oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide under ambient conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In  2  S  3  show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalysis property is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalysis reveal that the superoxide radical (&#8226;O  2  &#8208;  ) and singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis, Configurational Assignment and Biological Evaluations of the Lipid Mediator RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  , an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a  Z  &#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  methyl ester in 13% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of  S. aureus  and zymosan A bioparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Coexistence of Tellurium Cations and Anions in Phosphonium&#8208;based Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental tellurium readily dissolves in ionic liquids based on tetraalkylphosphonium cations even at temperatures below 100 &#176;C. In the case of ILs with acetate, decanoate, or dicyanamide anions, dark red to purple colored solutions form. A study combining NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of tellurium anions (Te  n  )  2&#8211;  with chain lengths up to at least  n  = 5, which are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. Since external influences could be excluded and no evidence of an ionic liquid reaction was found, disproportionation of the tellurium is the only possible dissolution mechanism. Although the spectroscopic detection of tellurium cations in these solutions is difficult, the coexistence of tellurium cations, such as (Te  4  )  2+  and (Te  6  )  4+  , and tellurium anions could be proven by cyclic voltammetry and electrodeposition experiments. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ILs are sufficient to stabilize both types of tellurium ions in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from enantiomeric helic[6]arenes, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes is developed, which subsequently provided a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes in almost quantitative yields. Moreover, the chirality transfer in the chiral [1]rotaxanes is also observed.







Abstract
Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combined with DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Competition rules! &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#8208;germylated phosphorus ylides of the general formula R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 bearing one chloride substituent on the group 14 element were synthesized and fully characterized. Chloride abstraction reactions provided access to dimeric or monomeric cations featuring a high fluoride ion affinity despite the relatively strong Cylide&#8722;E interaction with high double bond character.







Abstract
The synthesis and full characterization of &#945;&#8208;silylated (&#945;&#8208;SiCPs; 1&#8211;7) and &#945;&#8208;germylated (&#945;&#8208;GeCPs; 11&#8211;13) phosphorus ylides bearing one chloride substituent R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 (R=Ph; R1=Me, Et, Ph; R2=Me, Et, iPr, Mes; E=Si, Ge) is presented. The molecular structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The title compounds were applied in halide abstraction studies in order to access cationic species. The reaction of Ph3PC(Me)Si(Cl)Me2 (1) with Na[B(C6F5)4] furnished the dimeric phosphonium&#8208;like dication [Ph3PC(Me)SiMe2]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (8). The highly reactive, mesityl&#8208; or iPr&#8208;substituted cationic species [Ph3PC(Me)SiMes2][B(C6F5)4] (9) and [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) could be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Carrying out the halide abstraction reaction in the sterically demanding ether iPr2O afforded the protonated &#945;&#8208;SiCP [Ph3PCH(Et)Si(Cl)iPr2][B(C6F5)4] (6&#8201;dec) by sodium&#8208;mediated basic ether decomposition, whereas successfully synthesized [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) readily cleaves the F&#8722;C bond in fluorobenzene. Thus, the ambiphilic character of &#945;&#8208;SiCPs is clearly demonstrated. The less reactive germanium analogue [Ph3PC(Me)GeMes2][B{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}4] (14) was obtained by treating 11 with Na[B{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}4] and fully characterized including by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Structural parameters indicate a strong CYlide&#8722;Ge interaction with high double bond character, and consequently the C&#8722;E (E=Si, Ge) bonds in 9, 10 and 14 were analyzed with NBO and AIM methods.

         <title>Tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine: The Simplest Non&#8208;ionic Phosphorus Superbase and Strongly Donating Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline phosphorus superbase tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine is accessible through an easy and scalable procedure starting from cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals. The properties of the strongly electron&#8208;donating phosphine in coordination chemistry and the reactivity with small molecules (CO2, SO2, N2O and elemental chalcogens) were studied.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)3, a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)3 with N2O and the elemental chalcogens.

         <title>An H2O2 Molecule Stabilized inside Open&#8208;Cage C60 Derivatives by a Hydroxy Stopper</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives enabled the complete isolation of a single H2O2 molecule as the stable peroxosolvate in the solid state. Crystallographic and computational analyses revealed that the arrangement of the hydroxy group and intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization of the H2O2 molecule.







Abstract
An H2O2 molecule was isolated inside hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives by mixing an H2O2 solution with a precursor molecule followed by reduction of one of carbonyl groups on its orifice. Depending on the reduction site, two structural isomers for H2O2@open&#8208;fullerenes were obtained. A high encapsulation ratio of 81&#8201;% was attained at low temperature. The structures of the peroxosolvate complexes thus obtained were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray analysis, and DFT calculations, showing strong hydrogen bonding between the encapsulated H2O2 and the hydroxy group located at the center of the orifice. This OH group was found to act as a kinetic stopper, and the formation of the hydrogen bonding caused thermodynamic stabilization of the H2O2 molecule, both of which prevent its escape from the cage. One of the peroxosolvates was isolated by HPLC, affording H2O2@open&#8208;fullerene with 100&#8201;% encapsulation ratio, likely due to the intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction.

Depending on the reduction site, two structural isomers for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@open-fullerenes were obtained. A high encapsulation ratio of 81&#8201;% was attained at low temperature. The structures of the peroxosolvate complexes thus obtained were studied by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy, X-ray analysis, and DFT calculations, showing strong hydrogen bonding between the encapsulated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the hydroxy group located at the center of the orifice. This OH group was found to act as a kinetic stopper, and the formation of the hydrogen bonding caused thermodynamic stabilization of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, both of which prevent its escape from the cage. One of the peroxosolvates was isolated by HPLC, affording H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@open-fullerene with 100&#8201;% encapsulation ratio, likely due to the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer of ionic transition metal complex promotes electron injection and transport, resulting in an improved carrier balance of green CsPbBr3 perovskite/iTMC light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). The optimized external quantum efficiency reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for perovskite LECs so far.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Assignment of (&#8722;)&#8208;Fusaequisin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constitutional reassignment and configurational assignment of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A, an irregularly assembled polyketide from the ascomycete Fusarium equiseti, was accomplished by total synthesis. Structural assignment fuels the proposition that Podospora curvicolla (order Sordiales) and Fusarium equiseti (order Hypocreales) possess a common biosynthetic machinery to produce polyketides of solitary architecture.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Fusaequisin A is an irregularly assembled polyketide isolated from the ascomycete Fusarium equiseti. Fusaequisin A shares a carbon backbone with curvicollide C from the ascomycete Podospora curvicolla but its absolute configuration remained hitherto unsettled. Herein, we document the total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A and its 4&#8208;O&#8208;desmethyl derivative following a central&#8208;to&#8208;lateral building block strategy. Catalytic asymmetric Claisen rearrangement, Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination and olefin cross&#8208;metathesis served as key C/C&#8208;connecting transformations. The constitution and absolute configuration of (&#8722;)&#8208;fusaequisin A was deduced and the original structural assignment was adjusted.

         <title>Afterglow Implant for Arterial Embolization and Intraoperative Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glowing implant: The study developed a photochemical afterglow implant displaying more than one order of magnitude enhancement in afterglow emission compared with its nanoparticle counterparts. This implant exhibits a long lifetime, the ability to quickly transform into gel, and the ability to eliminate background interference. These features make the implant an excellent candidate for embolic agents and monitoring the effect of embolization.







Abstract
Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is wildly used in clinical treatments. However, the online monitoring of the thrombosis formation is limited due to the challenges of the direct visualization of embolic agents and the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic blood flow. Thus, we developed a photochemical afterglow implant with strong afterglow intensity and a long lifetime for embolization and imaging. The liquid pre&#8208;implant injected into the abdominal aorta of mice was rapidly transformed into a hydrogel in&#8197;situ to embolize the blood vessel. The vascular embolism position can be observed by the enhanced afterglow of the fixed implant, and the long lifetime of afterglow can also be used to monitor the effect of embolization. This provides an excellent candidate in bio&#8208;imaging to avoid the autofluorescence interference from continuous light excitation. The study suggests the potential usefulness of the implant as an embolic agent in TAE and artery imaging during a surgical procedure.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Terminal vs. Fluorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Allenamides via Addition of Diazo Compounds to Terminal Ynamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuI&#8208;catalyzed robust synthesis of N&#8208;allenamides from ynamides by the reaction with various diazo&#8208;compounds was developed. DFT calculations showed that this transformation relies on an uncommon, reversed mechanism that, regardless of the polarization of the ynamide, favors the addition of the diazo compound at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide. The protocol tolerates a wide range of functional groups. This copper&#8208;catalyzed process represents the first synthesis of tri&#8208;, di&#8208; or per&#8208;fluorinated N&#8208;allenamides from ynamides.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;mediated coupling reaction between ynamides and diazo&#8208;compounds to produce N&#8208;allenamides is reported for the first time. This method enables facile and rapid access to terminal N&#8208;allenamides by using commercially available TMS&#8208;diazomethane with wide functional group compatibility on the nitrogen. Furthermore, the ubiquity of molecules containing a fluorine moiety in medicine, in agricultural, and material science requires the continuous search of new building blocks, including this unique surrogate. The CuI/diazo protocol was successfully applied to the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;substituted N&#8208;allenamides. DFT calculations provided insights in the mechanism involved.

         <dc:description>Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;&#8208;bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom or heterocycle containing substrates. The base&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation induced emission leading to white light emission in diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8208;A groups or energy transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review.

The essence of van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;UV (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are illustrated as an important material system recently developed. Using first&#8208;principles simulations, the key role of the interlayer vdW connection for DUV NLO balance is discussed and the discovery process of related vdW DUV NLO materials is reviewed, with emphasis on the prospect of opportunities and challenges.







Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;UV (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal is an important material system recently developed. Herein, we review its concept and original intention, and then summarized the discovery process of related materials, including the role of A&#8208;site cations and the resulting two&#8208;/one&#8208;dimensional vdW DUV NLO systems. Finally, we evaluate the practical DUV NLO performance and prospected the opportunities and challenges.

         <title>In Vitro and In Vivo Sequestration of Methamphetamine by a Sulfated Acyclic CB[n]&#8208;Type Receptor</title>

Take a chill pill: We investigate the interactions of three sulfated acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors toward a panel of drugs of abuse by 1H NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry. TetM0 is biocompatible, not mutagenic, and does not inhibit the hERG ion channel which paves the way toward in&#8197;vivo application. The hyperlocomotion exhibited by mice treated with methamphetamine can be reversed in&#8197;vivo by treatment with TetM0.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two new acyclic sulfated acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors (TriM0 and Me4TetM0) and investigations of their binding properties toward a panel of drugs of abuse (1&#8211;13) by a combination of 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. TetM0 is the most potent receptor with Ka&#8805;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 toward methamphetamine, fentanyl, MDMA and mephedrone. TetM0 is not cytotoxic toward HepG2 and HEK 293 cells below 100&#8197;&#956;M according to MTS metabolic and adenylate kinase release assays and is well tolerated in&#8197;vivo when dosed at 46&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1. TetM0 does not inhibit the hERG ion channel and is not mutagenic based on the Ames fluctuation test. Finally, in&#8197;vivo efficacy studies show that the hyperlocomotion of mice treated with methamphetamine can be greatly reduced by treatment with TetM0 up to 5&#8197;minutes later. TetM0 has potential as a broad spectrum in&#8197;vivo sequestrant for drugs of abuse.

         <title>Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8722;H Activation through Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17351-17360, December 9, 2021. </description>

Metal ligand cooperation. Two different iminophosphoryl&#8208;substituted methandiide&#8208;derived carbene complexes have been applied in the P&#8722;H bond activation of secondary phosphines. Surprisingly versatile reaction outcomes were observed depending on the imine substituent at the methandiide ligand and the phosphine used. While more&#8208;electron&#8208;rich combinations led to either cyclometallation or an imine transfer, electron&#8208;poor combinations enabled selective P&#8722;H bond activation, thus impressively demonstrating the importance of tuning the M=C in this type of carbene complex for bond activation.







Abstract
The use of iminophosphoryl&#8208;tethered ruthenium carbene complexes to activate secondary phosphine P&#8722;H bonds is reported. Complexes of type [(p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;RuC(SO2Ph)(PPh2NR)] (with R = SiMe3 or 4&#8208;C6H4&#8722;NO2) were found to exhibit different reactivities depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine and the substituent at the iminophosphoryl moiety. Hence, the electron&#8208;rich silyl&#8208;substituted complex undergoes cyclometallation or shift of the imine moiety after cooperative activation of the P&#8722;H bond across the M=C linkage, depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine. Deuteration experiments and computational studies proved that cyclometallation is initiated by the activation process at the M=C bond and triggered by the high electron density at the metal in the phosphido intermediates. Consistently, replacement of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group by the electron&#8208;withdrawing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl substituent allowed the selective cooperative P&#8722;H activation to form stable activation products.

         <dc:description>
Silver(I) complexes of benzoimidazole and carbazole&#8208;derived sp2 N&#8208;containing Lewis bases are synthesized and the isostructural iodine(I) complexes with a strong 3&#8208;center 4&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond are obtained through the [N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N]+&#8594;[N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ cation exchange reaction.

The synthesis of iodine(I) complexes with either benzoimidazole or carbazole&#8208;derived sp2 N&#8208;containing Lewis bases is described, as well as their corresponding silver(I) complexes. The addition of elemental iodine to the linear two&#8208;coordinate Ag(I) complexes produces iodine(I) complexes with a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ bond. The 1H and 1H&#8208;15N HMBC NMR studies unambiguously confirm the formation of the complexes in all cases via the [N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N]+&#8594;[N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ cation exchange, with the 15N NMR chemical shift change between 94 to 111&#8197;ppm when compared to the free ligand. The single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on eight I+ complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ bonds with I&#8722;N bond distances of 2.21&#8211;2.26&#8197;&#197; and N&#8722;I&#8722;N angles of 177&#8211;180&#176;, whilst some of the corresponding Ag+ complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N angles of ca. 150&#176; and Ag&#8722;N bond distances of 2.09&#8211;2.18&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Nonheme Iron Imido Complexes Bearing a Non&#8208;Innocent Ligand: A Synthetic Chameleon Species in Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17495-17503, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a theoretical approach, iron(V and VI)&#8208;imido species with non&#8208;innocent ligands are revealed to have multiple energetically close&#8208;lying electromers, sometimes even without changing spin states, reminiscent of the so&#8208;called Compound I species in Cytochrome P450. In addition to showing multi&#8208;spin state reactivity, multiple electronic configurations within the same spin state are found to potentially affect the reactivity. Furthermore, the mechanism of benzene formation from cyclohexadiene is also explained in detail by theory.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;imido complexes can perform C&#8722;H activation and sulfimidation reactions, but are far less studied than the more ubiquitous iron&#8208;oxo species. As case studies, we have looked at a recently published iron(V)&#8208;imido ligand &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex, which is formally an iron(VI)&#8208;imido complex [FeV(NTs)(TAML+.)] (1; NTs=tosylimido), and an iron(V)&#8208;imido complex [FeV(NTs)(TAML)]&#8722; (2). Using a theoretical approach, we found that they have multiple energetically close&#8208;lying electromers, sometimes even without changing spin states, reminiscent of the so&#8208;called Compound I in Cytochrome P450. When studying their reactivity theoretically, it is indeed found that their electronic structures may change to perform efficient oxidations, emulating the multi&#8208;spin state reactivity in FeIVO systems. This is actually in contrast to the known [FeV(O)(TAML)]&#8722; species (3), where the reactions occur only on the ground spin state. We also looked into the whole reaction pathway for the C&#8722;H bond activation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene by these intermediates to reproduce the experimentally observed products, including steps that usually attract no interest (neither theoretically nor experimentally) due to their non&#8208;rate&#8208;limiting status and fast reactivity. A new &#8220;clustering non&#8208;rebound mechanism&#8221; is presented for this C&#8722;H activation reaction.

         <title>Development of Red&#8208;Shifted and Fluorogenic Nucleoside and Oligonucleotide Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17386-17394, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleoside based diarylethenes was modified, with the aim of bathochromically shifting the absorption wavelength in the visible range (&#955;max,vis) and to introduce photomodulatable fluorescence. Extending the &#960;&#8208;system of the bridging unit resulted in a desired red shift of &#955;max,vis and fluorogenicity could be obtained by the introduction of a fluorescent adenosine analogue.







Abstract
The reversible modulation of fluorescence signals by light is of high interest for applications in super&#8208;resolution microscopy, especially on the DNA level. In this article we describe the systematic variation of the core structure in nucleoside&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs), in order to generate intrinsically fluorescent photochromes. The introduction of aromatic bridging units resulted in a bathochromic shift of the visible absorption maximum of the closed&#8208;ring form, but caused reduced thermal stability and switching efficiency. The replacement of the thiophene aryl unit by thiazol improved the thermal stability, whereas the introduction of a benzothiophene unit led to inherent and modulatable turn&#8208;off fluorescence. This feature was further optimized by introducing a fluorescent indole nucleobase into the DAE core, resulting in an effective photoswitch with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.0166 and a fluorescence turn&#8208;off factor of 3.2. The site&#8208;specific incorporation into an oligonucleotide resulted in fluorescence&#8208;switchable DNA with high cyclization quantum yields and switching efficiency, which may facilitate future applications.

         <title>Fast Detection of Entacapone by a Lanthanide&#8211;Organic Framework with Rhombic Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17459-17464, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide&#8208;organic framework was synthesized to detect entacapone by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect.







Abstract
Entacapone (ENT) is a powerful catechol&#8208;O&#8208;methyl transferase inhibitor that is used for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's syndrome, but the amount used must be well controlled to avoid overtreatment and side effect. Fast and selective detection of ENT needs well&#8208;matched energy levels and well&#8208;designed sensor&#8208;ENT interaction which is highly challenging. In this work, a water stable europium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Eu&#8208;TDA) was synthesized to detect ENT by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity in the presence of main coexisting and interference species of plasma with a limit of detection of 5.01&#8197;&#956;M. The experimental results showed that the luminescence of Eu&#8208;TDA can be effectively quenched by ENT via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect mechanism in the system.

         <title>Emerging Yttrium Phosphides with Tetrahedron Phosphorus and Superconductivity under High Pressures</title>

Herein, several unprecedented Y&#8208;P compounds are predicted. Strikingly, vertex&#8208;sharing P4 polyhedrons in Fd&#8208;3m YP2 are firstly found in crystals. Importantly, Pm&#8208;3m Y3P sets a new record for superconductivity of binary transition&#8208;metal phosphides.







Abstract
Metal phosphides have triggered growing interest for their exotic structures and striking properties. Hence, within advanced structure search and first&#8208;principle calculations, several unprecedented Y&#8722;P compounds (e.&#8201;g., Y3P, Y2P, Y3P2, Y2P3, YP2, and YP3) were identified under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain&#8208;like network, buckled layer, three&#8208;dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly, Fd&#8208;3m YP2 can be viewed as assemblage of diamond&#8208;like Y structure and rare vertex&#8208;sharing tetrahedral P4&#8197;units. Impressively, electron&#8208;phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that Pm&#8208;3m Y3P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature Tc of 10.2&#8197;K among binary transition metal phosphides. Remarkably, the EPC of Pm&#8208;3m Y3P mainly arises from the contribution of low&#8208;frequency soft phonon modes, whereas mid&#8208;frequency phonon modes of Fd&#8208;3m YP2 dominate. These results strengthen knowledge of metal phosphides and pave a way for seeking superconductive transition metal phosphides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal phosphides have triggered growing interest for their exotic structures and striking properties. Hence, within advanced structure search and first-principle calculations, several unprecedented Y&#8722;P compounds (e.&#8201;g., Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P, Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, YP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and YP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) were identified under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain-like network, buckled layer, three-dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;Fd&lt;/i&gt;-3&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; YP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be viewed as assemblage of diamond-like Y structure and rare vertex-sharing tetrahedral P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;units. Impressively, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;-3&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Total Syntheses of Conjugation&#8208;Ready Repeating Units of Acinetobacter baumannii AB5075 for Glycoconjugate Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17444-17451, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using efficient and stereoselective glycosylations and a double&#8208;serial inversion strategy, the repeating unit of A. baumannii AB5075 as well as two analogues containing a challenging (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl chain were synthesized. All of the oligosaccharides bear an amino group that allows for the covalent attachment to glycan microarrays and carrier proteins. These densely functionalized aminoglycoside trisaccharides are the basis for the development of novel glycoconjugate vaccines against A. baumannii.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious nosocomial infections. One of the multidrug&#8208;resistant strains, AB5075, can result in bacteremia, pneumonia and wound infections associated with high morbidity and mortality. The structurally unique glycans on the surface of these bacteria are attractive targets for the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. Here, we report the first total synthesis of the densely functionalized trisaccharide repeating unit of A. baumannii AB5075 as well as two analogues. The construction of 1,2&#8208;cis linkages between the rare sugars relies on a double&#8208;serial inversion strategy. The judicious selection of building blocks and reaction conditions allowed for stereoselective glycosylations, the installation of acetamido groups and the (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl chain.

An efficient enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes is a long&#8208;standing challenge in organocatalysis. This work sheds light on why such a seeming simple aminocatalytic reaction cannot deliver a stereocontrolled outcome.







Abstract
Results of an examination of the organocatalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of 2&#8208;phenylpropanal are described. Synthetic investigation including the screening of primary and secondary aminocatalysts, many different reaction conditions, and other &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes show that especially primary aminocatalysts can catalyze the formation of the &#945;&#8208;chloro branched aldehydes in good yields, but only with moderate enantioselectivities. In order to try to understand the challenge in obtaining high enantioselectivity for the aminocatalytic &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes a series of experimental investigations were performed employing 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a model system. These investigations have been coupled with computational investigations, which provided important insight into the moderate enantioselectivity of this chlorination reaction. Analysis of the reaction showed, that the lack of control over the selectivity of formation of the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;enamine intermediate, and the clustering of reaction barriers of possible reaction pathways help to rationalize difficulties in producing high enantioselectivity.

Arrays of molecular rotors on Ag(111) surfaces were prepared and investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The synthesis follows a modular approach by combining a molecular platform that absorbs on the surface, a phenyl group as rotary joint and pyridine or pyridazine as molecular dipoles. The molecules sublime without decomposition and form well&#8208;ordered monolayers on Ag(111) surfaces. There is strong intermolecular interaction of the dipoles, which leads to pairwise head&#8208;to&#8208;tail orientations. Rotation was induced by the STM tip.







Abstract
A set of dipolar molecular rotor compounds was designed, synthesized and adsorbed as self&#8208;assembled 2D arrays on Ag(111) surfaces. The title molecules are constructed from three building blocks: (a) 4,8,12&#8208;trioxatriangulene (TOTA) platforms that are known to physisorb on metal surfaces such as Au(111) and Ag(111), (b) phenyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that function as pivot joints to reduce the barrier to rotation, (c) pyridine and pyridazine units as small dipolar units on top. Theoretical calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) investigations hint at the fact that the dipoles of neighboring rotors interact through space through pairs of energetically favorable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangements.

         <title>Contrasting the Mechanism of H2 Activation by Monomeric and Potassium&#8208;Stabilized Dimeric AlI Complexes: Do Potassium Atoms Exert any Cooperative Effect?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17369-17378, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two is not better than one!. In this work, we determined that the dimeric, low&#8208;valent AlI complex (D) is not more reactive than the monomeric derivative (M) toward the activation of H2. Moreover, neither complicity between the two monomers in the dimeric complex nor cooperative effects by K+ atoms was observed in the activation mechanism. A complete characterization of the H2 activation process has been conducted, proffering insights that can be beneficial for future experimental realizations.







Abstract
Aluminyl anions are low&#8208;valent, anionic, and carbenoid aluminum species commonly found stabilized with potassium cations from the reaction of Al&#8208;halogen precursors and alkali compounds. These systems are very reactive toward the activation of &#963;&#8208;bonds and in reactions with electrophiles. Various research groups have detected that the potassium atoms play a stabilization role via electrostatic and cation
 interactions with nearby (aromatic)&#8208;carbocyclic rings from both the ligand and from the reaction with unsaturated substrates. Since stabilizing K&#8943;H bonds are witnessed in the activation of this class of molecules, we aim to unveil the role of these metals in the activation of the smaller and less polarizable H2 molecule, together with a comprehensive characterization of the reaction mechanism. In this work, the activation of H2 utilizing a NON&#8208;xanthene&#8208;Al dimer, [K{Al(NON)}]2 (D) and monomeric, [Al(NON)]&#8722; (M) complexes are studied using density functional theory and high&#8208;level coupled&#8208;cluster theory to reveal the potential role of K+ atoms during the activation of this gas. Furthermore, we aim to reveal whether D is more reactive than M (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the D complex toward the activation of H2. The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric complexes were found to be very close (around 33&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the nature of the energy barriers for the monomeric and dimeric complexes are inherently different. The former is dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants (and increased interaction energies between them). Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H2 distorts the most, usually over 0.77 
. Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies between the complexes and H2 are the main stabilizing components up to the respective transition states. The results suggest that the K+ atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their cooperative role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H2. Cooperation between the two monomers in D is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H2 is wholly disengaged.

These systems are very reactive toward the activation of &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-bonds and in reactions with electrophiles. Various research groups have detected that the potassium atoms play a stabilization role via electrostatic and cation
 interactions with nearby (aromatic)-carbocyclic rings from both the ligand and from the reaction with unsaturated substrates. Since stabilizing K&#8943;H bonds are witnessed in the activation of this class of molecules, we aim to unveil the role of these metals in the activation of the smaller and less polarizable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, together with a comprehensive characterization of the reaction mechanism. In this work, the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilizing a NON-xanthene-Al dimer, [K{Al(NON)}]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;) and monomeric, [Al(NON)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;) complexes are studied using density functional theory and high-level coupled-cluster theory to reveal the potential role of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; atoms during the activation of this gas. Furthermore, we aim to reveal whether &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; is more reactive than &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; complex toward the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric complexes were found to be very close (around 33&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the nature of the energy barriers for the monomeric and dimeric complexes are inherently different. The former is dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants (and increased interaction energies between them). Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; distorts the most, usually over 0.77 
. Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies between the complexes and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the main stabilizing components up to the respective transition states. The results suggest that the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their cooperative role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cooperation between the two monomers in &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is wholly disengaged.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Easy Production of &#8220;Difficult Peptides&#8221; Using Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis and a New Methionine Analogue as a Latent Peptide Cleavage Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17487-17494, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difficult peptides as well as unnatural analogues were produced by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis, applying a fusion protein strategy. A new heat&#8208;labile analogue of methionine was utilized in combination with a stable carrier to release the peptide only. No toxic chemicals, neither protected amino acids nor special equipment is required, thus disclosing a considerable alternative to solid phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Aliphatic &#947;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporated in place of their canonical analogues through cell&#8208;free protein synthesis act as heat&#8208;labile linkers, offering a useful strategy for the straightforward production of target peptides as fusion proteins, from which the targets are readily released. Until now, the natural abundance of aliphatic amino acids in peptides has limited the scope of the method, as it leads to undesired cleavage sites in synthesized products, but here the authors report the development of a new cleavable chloro amino acid that incorporates in place of the relatively rare amino acid methionine, thus greatly expanding the scope of producible targets. This new strategy is employed for simplified peptide synthesis with a methionine&#8208;free fusion partner, allowing single&#8208;site incorporation of the cleavable linker for clean release and easy purification of the target peptide. Its utility is demonstrated through the straightforward preparation of two peptides reported to be challenging targets and not accessible through standard solid&#8208;phase chemical methodologies, as well as analogues.

         <title>Synergy of Bi2O3 and RuO2 Nanocatalysts for Low&#8208;Overpotential and Wide pH&#8208;Window Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17395-17401, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supporting hybrid electrocatalyst, RuO2&#8722;Bi2O3/FEG, was prepared by electrodepositing RuO2 and Bi2O3 nanoparticles onto the surface of functionalized graphite foil (FEG), which exhibits excellent performance at low overpotential towards electrochemical ammonia synthesis due to the synergistic effect between Bi2O3 and RuO2. This work highlights a new electrocatalyst design strategy that combines transition and main&#8208;group metal elements, which may provide some inspirations for designing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance nitrogen reduction electrocatalysts in the future.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is still seriously impeded by the inferior NH3 yield and low Faradaic efficiency, especially at low overpotentials. Herein, we report the synthesis of nano&#8208;sized RuO2 and Bi2O3 particles grown on functionalized exfoliated graphene (FEG) through in&#8197;situ electrodeposition, denoted as RuO2&#8722;Bi2O3/FEG. The prepared self&#8208;supporting RuO2&#8722;Bi2O3/FEG hybrid with a Bi mass loading of 0.70&#8197;wt% and Ru mass loading of 0.04&#8197;wt% shows excellent NRR performance at low overpotentials in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes. It achieves a large NH3 yield of 4.58&#177;0.16&#8197;&#956;gNH3&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;2 with a high Faradaic efficiency of 14.6&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4 electrolyte. This performance benefits from the synergistic effect between Bi2O3 and RuO2 which respectively have a fairly strong interaction of Bi 6p orbitals with the N 2p band and abundant supply of *H, as well as the binder&#8208;free characteristic and the convenient electron transfer via graphene nanosheets. This work highlights a new electrocatalyst design strategy that combines transition and main&#8208;group metal elements, which may provide some inspirations for designing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance NRR electrocatalysts in the future.

         <title>Bilayer rGO&#8208;Based Photothermal Evaporator for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification[]**
</title>

A bilayer rGO&#8208;based photothermal evaporator composed of rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) scaffold layer and rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer was fabricated for efficient solar&#8208;driven water purification. The independent evaporator with oriented hydrophilic microchannels integrates water transport, photothermal conversion, photocatalysis, and adsorption, thus achieving high water evaporation rate (1.63&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1) and excellent VOC removal efficiency (96&#8201;%).







Abstract
Interfacial evaporation has emerged as a promising approach to produce freshwater. However, an urgent concern is that, due to the illegal discharge of industrial wastewater, most water bodies are polluted by trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are easily volatilized and enriched in the collected water during the interfacial evaporation process. Herein, a bilayer photothermal evaporator was reasonably designed for contaminated water purification. The bottom hydrophilic rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) sheets purposefully disintegrate water transport channels, thus quickly removing VOCs through physical adsorption. The rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer sufficiently absorbs incident light and therefore persistently generates reactive oxidizing species to degrade upward VOCs. Notably, the oriented microchannels inside the evaporator allow sustained light reflections to improve the utilization of solar energy. The evaporation rate can reach 1.63&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1 with a considerably high VOC removal efficiency of up to 96&#8201;%. Such an integrated bilayer evaporator provides an effective strategy to obtain clean water via solar distillation.

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;Type Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17361-17368, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amido&#8208;substituted bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound 2 Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;type character forms adducts with the carbene NHC
 and with AlBr3. The NHC adduct (3) further coordinates to BH3. Compound 2 displays a very weak Lewis acidic and a strong Lewis basic site. This is confirmed by reaction with Brookharts acid to yield 7. With diphenylacetylene at 111&#8201;&#176;C, formal fragmentation into a silylene and a trisilacyclopropenylidene occurs. Both are trapped with the alkyne to afford 8 and 9.







Abstract
The bicyclic amido&#8208;substituted silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 2 (Mes=Mesityl=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) features enhanced zwitterionic character and different reactivity from the analogous compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}4 1 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) due to the smaller mesityl substituents. In a reaction with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene NHC
 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), we observe adduct formation to give Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NHC
 (3). This adduct reacts further with the Lewis acid BH3 to yield the Lewis acid&#8211;base complex Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NHC
&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 (4). Coordination of AlBr3 to 2 leads to the adduct 5. Calculated proton affinities and fluoride ion affinities reveal highly Lewis basic and very weak Lewis acidic character of the low&#8208;valent silicon atoms in 1 and 2. This is confirmed by protonation of 1 and 2 with Brookharts acid yielding 6 and 7. Reaction with diphenylacetylene only occurs at 111&#8201;&#176;C with 2 in toluene and is accompanied by fragmentation of 2 to afford the silacyclopropene 8 and the trisilanorbornadiene species 9.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of CoCeSx Bimetallic Sulfide Nanoparticles on a Bi&#8208;Pyrene Terminated Molecular Wire Modified Graphene Surface for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17402-17411, December 9, 2021. </description>

The graphene sheets were prepared using a bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets, thereby forming nanoscale spaces between sheets. The angle between the BPMW coplanar pyrene group and the phenyl group was 33.2&#176;, and the graphene layer is supported in an oblique direction. Finally, CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid is synthesized and employed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor.







Abstract
The excellent electrical conductivity of graphene is due to its highly&#8208;conjugated structures. Manipulation of the electronic and mechanical properties of graphene can be achieved by controlling the destruction of its in&#8208;sheet conjugation system. Herein, we report the preparation of CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at the molecular level. In this study, sodium alginate was reacted with Co2+ and Ce3+, and the composite was loaded onto a graphene surface. The graphene sheets were prepared using a bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets, thereby forming nanoscale spaces between sheets. The angle between the BPMW coplanar pyrene group and the phenyl group was 33.2&#176;, and the graphene layer is supported in an oblique direction. Finally, a three&#8208;dimensional porous composite was obtained after annealing and vulcanization. The obtained CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO exhibited excellent electrical conductivity and remarkable cycle stability. When the current density was 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, its specific capacitance was as high as 1004&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1. BPMW modifies graphene through the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction and special structure to obtain excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, a solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated based on the synthesized CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid, which exhibited a power density of 979&#8197;W&#8197;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 23.96&#8197;Wh&#8197;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Indandione&#8208;Terminated Quinoidal Compounds for Low&#8208;Bandgap Small Molecules with Strong Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption: Effect of Conjugation Length on the Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17437-17443, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap quinoidal molecule with intense absorption in the first (760&#8211;1000&#8197;nm) and second (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) near&#8208;infrared region was developed by synergistical extending quinoidal core and end groups.







Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors have attracted much attention for their multiple applications in optoelectronics. However, the realization of narrow bandgap is challenging particularly for small molecules. Herein, we have synthesized four quinoidal compounds, i.&#8201;e., QSN3, QSN4, QSN5 and QSN6, with electron rich S,N&#8208;heteroacene as the quinoidal core and indandione as the end&#8208;groups. The optical bandgap of the quinoidal compounds is systematically decreased with the extension of quinoidal skeleton, while maintaining stable closed&#8208;shell ground state. QSN6 absorbs an intense absorption in the first and second near&#8208;infrared region in the solid state, and has extremely low optical bandgap of 0.74&#8197;eV. Cyclic voltammetry analyses reveal that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four quinoidal compounds all lie below &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, resulting in good electron&#8208;transporting characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. These results demonstrated that the combination of &#960;&#8208;extended quinoidal core and end&#8208;groups in quinoidal compounds is an effective strategy for the synthesis of low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with good stability.

The synthesis of two novel gallium hydride complexes supported by an N,N&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)amine pincer ligand is described and their activity as catalysts for the catalytic reduction of aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide is explored.







Abstract
Gallium hydrides stabilised by primary and secondary amines are scarce due to their propensity to eliminate dihydrogen. Consequently, their reactivity has received limited attention. The synthesis of two novel gallium hydride complexes HGa(THF)[ON(H)O] and H2Ga[&#956;2&#8208;ON(H)O]Ga[ON(H)O] ([ON(H)O]2&#8722;=N,N&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)amine) is described and their reactivity towards aldehydes and ketones is explored. These reactions afford alkoxide&#8208;bridged dimers through 1,2&#8208;hydrogallation reactions. The gallium hydrides can be regenerated through Ga&#8722;O/B&#8722;H metathesis from the reaction of such dimers with pinacol borane (HBpin) or 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN). These observations allowed us to target the catalytic reduction of carbonyl substrates (aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide) with low catalyst loadings at room temperature.

         <title>Cover Feature: Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;Type Character (Chem. Eur. J. 69/2021)</title>

The unsaturated bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilatetraamide Si4{N(Mes)SiMe3}4 shown in the upper right corner has two threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms that show zwitterionic character. This gives the molecule intramolecular FLP&#8208;type character. Different acids such as AlBr3, BH3, H+ and the base NHCMe4 can simply coordinate to the threefold&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms. These reagents &#8220;click&#8221; in place just like magnetic sticks and steel balls from a molecular construction kit do. More information can be found in the Full Paper by F. Lips et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103101).

         <title>Front Cover: Domino Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;Extension: A Facile Path to Extended Perylenes and Terrylenes (Chem. Eur. J. 69/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17264-17264, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective activation of identical functional groups is one of the most challenging tasks in the realm of organic chemistry. Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) is a reaction that distinguishes &#8220;active&#8221; and &#8220;dormant&#8221; aldehyde groups based on their position and ability to participate in intramolecular reactions. This unusual feature allows the method to be used for programmed domino folding, in which aldehyde groups are activated sequentially in accordance with the program inbuilt into the precursor's structure. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Amsharov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103098).

         <title>Frontispiece: gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Substituted Fluoroalkenes as Mimics of Amide Derivatives or Phosphates: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as relevant and stable mimic of various moieties. Taking into account the steric and electronic similarities between the amide and the fluoroalkene moieties, this mimicry can be extended to amide derivatives to obtain urea, carbamate and S&#8208;thiocarbamate mimics. Other gem&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes can also be used as mimic of biorelevant phosphate moiety as well as platform towards more complex molecules. The synthetic access to this class of fluoroalkenes including O, S, N, P, B and Si heteroatoms is presented in the Review by S. Couve&#8208;Bonnaire, J.&#8208;P. Bouillon et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;17273&#8197;ff.

         <title>Cover Feature: Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8722;H Activation through Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation (Chem. Eur. J. 69/2021)</title>

P&#8722;H bond activation is an important step in many catalytic applications involving the formation of new P&#8722;C bonds. The icebreaker &#8220;RV Bond Activation&#8221;, which symbolizes our carbene complexes depicted by the constellation in the sky, is able to easily break P&#8722;H bonds via the carbene linkage. The splitting of phosphines into protons and phosphide fragments (depicted as ice shards flying away) occurs even at low temperatures. More information can be found in the Full Paper by V.&#8197;H. Gessner et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103151).

         <title>gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Substituted Fluoroalkenes as Mimics of Amide Derivatives or Phosphates: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17273-17292, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the unique properties of the fluoroalkene moiety &#8208; mimic of amide bond, high strength of C&#8722;F bond &#8208; several gem&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as relevant and stable mimics of important moieties, such as phosphate, urea, carbamate and S&#8208;thiocarbamate. The gem&#8208;heteroatom substituted fluoroalkene scaffold could also be the starting point toward more complex molecules. Herein, the synthetic access to these fluoroalkenes derivatives over the last decade is described.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes have received little attention despite their great potential in medicinal chemistry or in fine chemistry. Indeed, due to the electronic and steric similarity between the fluoroalkene moiety and the amide bond as well as the high strength of the carbon&#8208;fluorine bond, these gem&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as stable mimics of various important organic functions, such as phosphates, carbamates, S&#8208;thiocarbamates and ureas. We present herein an overview describing the syntheses over the last decade of heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes in geminal position. This review will be divided into several sections covering each the common following heteroatom: oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, sulfur&#8208;, phosphorus&#8208;, boron&#8208; and silicon&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes.

         <title>Synthesis and Transformations of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17293-17321, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review considered recent progress and achievements in the synthesis and transformation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines. The development of strategies for direct and selective preparation of NH&#8208;sulfoximines, even in enantioenriched form or by using sustainable approaches and continuous flow synthesis, are reported. Transformations of sulfoximines by N&#8722;S, N&#8722;P, N&#8722;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions are also covered.







Abstract
Recent years have seen a marked increase in the occurrence of sulfoximines in the chemical sciences, often presented as valuable motifs for medicinal chemistry. This has been prompted by both pioneering works taking sulfoximine containing compounds into clinical trials and the concurrent development of powerful synthetic methods. This review covers recent developments in the synthesis of sulfoximines concentrating on developments since 2015. This includes extensive developments in both S&#8722;N and S&#8722;C bond formations. Flow chemistry processes for sulfoximine synthesis are also covered. Finally, subsequent transformations of sulfoximines, particularly in N&#8208;functionalization are reviewed, including N&#8722;S, N&#8722;P, N&#8722;C bond forming processes and cyclization reactions.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Formation of Cyano&#8208;Vinylene Linked Chains by Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17336-17340, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the thermally induced synthesis of CN&#8208;substituted phenylene vinylene chains through Knoevenagel condensation reaction on an Au(111) surface. The formation of C=C interlinked chains is investigated by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory.







Abstract
The rapid development of on&#8208;surface synthesis provides a unique approach toward the formation of carbon&#8208;based nanostructures with designed properties. Herein, we present the on&#8208;surface formation of CN&#8208;substituted phenylene vinylene chains on the Au(111) surface, thermally induced by annealing the substrate stepwise at temperatures between 220&#8201;&#176;C and 240&#8201;&#176;C. The reaction is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory. Supported by the calculated reaction pathway, we assign the observed chain formation to a Knoevenagel condensation between an aldehyde and a methylene nitrile substituent.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Stiff&#8208;Stilbene: Proton&#8208;Gated Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitching and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization</title>

Push&#8208;pull stiff&#8208;stilbene, containing dimethylamino and cyano substituents, undergoes E&#8208;Z isomerization upon irradiation with visible light. The photochromic properties can be controlled by acid/base as an orthogonal secondary stimulus. Beside inhibiting the visible&#8208;light triggered isomerization process, acid addition significantly lowers the energy barrier to thermal back&#8208;isomerization.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor substituted stiff&#8208;stilbene is shown to undergo isomerization induced by visible light avoiding the need for harmful UV light. This visible&#8208;light photoswitching is inhibited by protonation of the dimethylamino&#8208;donor unit, disrupting the push&#8208;pull character and thus, gating of the photochromic properties is allowed by acid/base addition. Remarkably, the addition of a mild acid also triggers fast thermal back&#8208;isomerization, which is unprecedented for stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitches usually having a very high energy barrier for this process. These combined features offer unique orthogonal control over switching behavior by light and protonation, which is investigated in detail by 1H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. In addition, TD&#8208;DFT calculations are used to gain further insight into the absorption properties. Our results will help elevating the level of control over dynamic behavior in stiff&#8208;stilbene applications.

Towards nanographenes: Domino&#8208;DPEX (dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension) is a new synthetic approach to extended nanographenes containing a perylene or terrylene core. The pronounced regioselctivity towards aldehyde groups in different positions makes DPEX an excellent tool for implementing pre&#8208;programmed multiple annulation of simple precursors of elusive nanographenes. This approach enables the formation of up to five C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;step in up to 94&#8201;% per C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new method for synthesis of extended perylenes and terrylenes. The technique is based on the cascade dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) of aryl aldehydes, in which stepwise annulations activate previously &#8220;dormant&#8221; substituents. Two&#8208; and fourfold cyclizations of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehydes offer a rapid path to unsymmetrical perylenes and elusive terrylene derivatives, respectively. DPEX of 3,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(phenanthrene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl)bis (([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)) leads to the biradical structure, which proceeds in&#8197;situ into oxidative electrocyclization at room temperature. The described domino process complements and expands DPEX approach to a large family of fused acenes and related PAHs.

         <title>Plasmon Coupling Enhanced Micro&#8208;Spectroscopy and Imaging for Sensitive Discrimination of Membrane Domains of a Single Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17331-17335, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the additional plasmonic silver film for surface plasmon (SP) excitation to selectively enhance the fluorescence&#8208;Raman signal from the basal membrane in the near&#8208;field, plasmon coupling enhanced microscopic technique is capable of selectively exciting the basal and lateral cell membranes at the surface plasmon resonance (&#952;SP) and critical (&#952;C) angles, respectively. The brighter micro&#8208;images and more intense micro&#8208;spectra of the probes bound to basal and lateral cell membranes in SP and critical excitation modes than in conventional EPI mode allow the membrane domains to be clearly distinguished.







Abstract
Different cell membrane domains play different roles in many cell processes, and the discrimination of these domains is of considerable importance for the elucidation of cellular functions. However, the strategies available for distinguishing these cell membrane domains are limited. A novel technique called plasmon coupling enhanced micro&#8208;spectroscopy and imaging to discriminate basal and lateral membrane domains of a single cell combines the application of an additional plasmonic silver film for surface plasmon (SP) excitation to selectively excite and enhance the basal membranes in the near&#8208;field with directional enhanced microscopic imaging and spectroscopy. The SP and critical evanescent fields are induced upon excitation through a silver&#8208;coated semitransparent coverslip at the surface plasmon resonance and critical angles, respectively. The basal and lateral membrane domains located within the SP and critical evanescent fields can be selectively excited and distinguished by adjusting the incident angle of laser irradiation. Moreover, the brighter images and more intense spectra of membrane&#8208;targeting fluorescence&#8208;Raman probes under directional excitation than in conventional EPI mode allow clear identification of the membrane domains.

         <title>The Electrochemical cis&#8208;Chlorination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17341-17345, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double role: The cis&#8208;chlorination of alkenes is realised in an electrochemical setup with PhSeCl as catalyst. The supporting electrolyte (TBACl) acts as nucleophilic reagent for the SN2&#8208;type replacement of selenium versus chloride in the key step of the process while the PhSeCl&#8208;alkene adduct is activated by electrochemically generated PhSeCl3.







Abstract
The first example for the electrochemical cis&#8208;dichlorination of alkenes is presented. The reaction can be performed with little experimental effort by using phenylselenyl chloride as catalyst and tetrabutylammoniumchloride as supporting electrolyte, which also acts as nucleophilic reagent for the SN2&#8208;type replacement of selenium versus chloride. Cyclic voltammetric measurements and control experiments revealed a dual role of phenylselenyl chloride in the reaction. Based on these results a reaction mechanism was postulated, where the key step of the process is the activation of a phenylselenyl chloride&#8208;alkene adduct by electrochemically generated phenylselenyl trichloride. Like this, different aliphatic and aromatic cyclic and acyclic alkenes were converted to the dichlorinated products. Thereby, throughout high diastereoselectivities were achieved for the cis&#8208;chlorinated compounds of &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 or higher.

         <title>C&#8211;H Arylation of Benzene with Aryl Halides using H2 and a Water&#8208;Soluble Rh&#8208;Based Electron Storage Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 69, Page 17326-17330, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four requirements: 1) H2&#8208;activation is performed in water, 2) electrons from H2 are stored on the metal (M) center as a low&#8208;valent species, 3) the aryl halide is cleaved by oxidative addition to generate an M&#8722;C bond, and 4) radical transfer occurs due to the M&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
This paper reports the first example of C&#8722;H arylation of benzene under mild conditions, using H2 as an electron source {turnover numbers (TONs)=0.7&#8211;2.0 for 24&#8197;h}. The reaction depends on a Rh&#8208;based electron storage catalyst, and proceeds at room temperature and in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the H2 is inactive during the radical transfer step, greatly reducing unwanted side reactions.

         <title>Calixarenes incorporating sulfonamide moieties: versatile ligands for carbonic anhydrases inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki  values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and Molecular Modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Piers' Borane Induced Tetramerization of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report that the reaction of Piers' borane, i.e. HB(C 6 F 5 ) 2 , with an excess of arylacetylenes at room temperature leads to tetramerization of the acetylene and the diastereoselective formation of boryl&#8208;substituted tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydropentalenes. The reaction mechanism was investigated by isotope labeling experiments and DFT computations. These investigations indicate that a series of 1,2&#8208;carboboration reactions form an octatetraene that undergoes an electrocyclization. Two skeletal rearrangements then presumably lead to the formation of the tetrahydropentalene core. Overall, this intricate and unprecedented transformation comprises five carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations in a single reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaching new biocatalytic reactivity using continuous flow reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of the Conformational Space of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA Quadruplex RG&#8208;1 by Cellular Components and the Amyloidogenic Peptides &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and hIAPP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid&#8208;19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG&#8208;1 RNA&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N&#8208;gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type&#8208;II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG&#8208;1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG&#8208;1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies. These results may therefore shed more light on the relationship between PD as well as T2DM and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 disease and their molecular underpinnings. Since dysregulation of G4Q formation by rationally designed targeting compounds affects the control of cellular processes, this study should contribute to the development of specific ligands for intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin Metathesis in Confinement: Towards Covalent Organic Framework Scaffolds for Increased Macrocyclization Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer vast structural and chemical diversity enabling a wide and growing range of applications. While COFs are well&#8208;established as heterogeneous catalysts, so far, their high and ordered porosity has scarcely been utilized to its full potential when it comes to spatially confined reactions in COF pores to alter the outcome of reactions. Here, we present a highly porous and crystalline, large&#8208;pore COF as catalytic support in a,w&#8208;diene ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions, leading to increased macrocylization selectivity. COF pore&#8208;wall modification by immobilization of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8208;type catalyst via a mild silylation reaction provides a molecularly precise heterogeneous metathesis catalyst. An increased macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) selectivity over oligomerization (O) for the heterogeneous COF&#8208;catalyst (MMC:O = 1.35) of up to 51% compared to the homogeneous catalyst (MMC:O = 0.90) was observed along with a substrate&#8208;size dependency in selectivity, pointing to diffusion limitations induced by the pore confinement.</dc:description>

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group&#160;P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is p&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P.&#160;In situ&#160;studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bridged Oligosilanylsilylmono&#8208; and Oligosilanylsilyl&#173;di&#173;cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates 8[B(C6F5)4], 9[B(C6F5)4] and diborates 10[B(C6F5)4]2 have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;&#8722;&#969;&#8208;dihydrido&#8208; (11) and branched tetrahydrido&#8208;oligo&#173;silanes (13) and trityl cation.

Abstract
This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library through a Groebke&#8208;Blackburn&#8208;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) approach employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR process gives access to skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an in&#8197;situ generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The products were analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and the cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing N,C&#8208;palladacycles through regioselective ortho&#8208;palladation.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Perfluoroalkylation of Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient process for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides is reported in this work. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.







Abstract
An efficient and broadly applicable process is reported for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes including benzofurans, benzothiophenes, (aza)indoles, furans and pyrroles. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the efficiency and robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Tin/Tin Oxide/CNT Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial structure of Pt&#8722;Sn/SnOx/CNT composite electrocatalysts was rationally engineered on carbon nanotubes for achieving high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. Through a carefully designed two&#8208;step (oxidation&#8208;reduction) heat&#8208;treatment route, the coverage of SnOx thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnOx. The optimized PtSn&#8722;SnOx interface showed significantly improved performances toward ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Ethanol is a promising liquid clean energy source in the energy conversion field. However, the self&#8208;poisoning caused by the strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates (typically, CO) is a critical problem in ethanol oxidation reaction. To address this issue, we proposed a joint use of two strategies, alloying of Pt with other metals and building Pt/metal&#8208;oxide interfaces, to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. For this, a well&#8208;designed synthetic route combining wet impregnation with a two&#8208;step thermal treatment process was established to construct PtSn/SnOx interfaces on carbon nanotubes. Using this route, the alloying of Pt&#8722;Sn and formation of PtSn&#8722;SnOx interfaces can simultaneously be achieved, and the coverage of SnOx thin films on PtSn alloy nanoparticles can be facilely tuned by the strong interaction between Pt and SnOx. The results revealed that the partial coverage of SnOx species not only retained the active sites, but also enhanced the CO anti&#8208;poisoning ability of the catalyst. Consequently, the H&#8722;PtSn/SnOx/CNT&#8208;2 catalyst with an optimized PtSn&#8722;SnOx interface showed significantly improved performances toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (825&#8197;mA&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). This study provides deep insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of PtSn/metal oxide composite catalysts, which would be helpful for the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based ethanol oxidation reaction catalysts.

         <title>Missing Member in the MIIMIIISi4N7 Compound Class: Carbothermal Reduction and Nitridation Synthesis Reveal Substitution of Nitrogen by Carbon and Oxygen in CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx]:Eu2+/Ce3+ (x&#8776;0.3)</title>

Carbon copy: The oxonitridocarbidosilicate CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) has been synthesized by carbothermal reduction and nitridation. Incorporation of carbon was confirmed by 13C and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. Complementary EDX measurements suggest that simultaneous incorporation of oxygen compensates for the negative charge excess induced by carbon. Eu2+&#8208; and Ce3&#8208;doped CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) exhibit yellow&#8208;green and blue emission, respectively.







Abstract
The nitridosilicate CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) was synthesized by carbothermal reduction and nitridation starting from CaH2, Lu2O3, graphite and amorphous Si3N4 at 1550&#8201;&#176;C in a radiofrequency furnace. CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) crystallizes isotypically to many previously known MIIMIIISi4N7 compounds in the space group P63mc, as was confirmed by Rietveld refinement based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Incorporation of carbon into the crystal structure as a result of the carbothermal synthesis route was confirmed by 13C and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. For the first time in the MIIMIIISi4N7 compound class, complementary EDX measurements suggest that simultaneous incorporation of oxygen compensates for the negative charge excess induced by carbon, resulting in an adjusted sum formula, CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3). When excited with UV&#8208;to&#8208;blue light, CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) shows an emission maximum in the blue spectral region (&#955;em=484&#8197;nm; fwhm=4531&#8197;cm&#8722;1) upon doping with Ce3+, whereas Eu2+&#8208;doped CaLu[Si4N7&#8211;2xCxOx] (x&#8776;0.3) exhibits a yellow&#8208;green emission (&#955;em=546&#8197;nm; fwhm=3999&#8197;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Europium is Different: Solvent and Ligand Effects on Oxidation State Outcomes and C&#8208;F Activation in Reactions Between Europium Metal and Pentafluorophenylsilver</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ovoid EuII cage with a rare &#956;4&#8208;pyrazolate binding including an &#951;5&#8208;(N2C3)&#8208;Eu bond is reported. Solvent and ligand variations affect the oxidation state outcomes, and the synthesis features the first C&#8722;F activation by AgC6F5 in redox transmetallation/protolysis (RTP) reactions.







Abstract
Unique outcomes have emerged from the redox transmetallation/ protolysis (RTP) reactions of europium metal with [Ag(C6F5)(py)] (py=pyridine) and pyrazoles (RR&#8242;pzH). In pyridine, a solvent not normally used for RTP reactions, the products were mainly EuII complexes, [Eu(RR&#8242;pz)2(py)4] (RR&#8242;pz=3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazolate (Ph2pz) 1; 3&#8208;(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolate (ttfpz) 2; 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpyrazolate (PhMepz) 3). However, use of 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazole (tBu2pzH) gave trivalent [Eu(tBu2pz)3(py)2] 4, whereas the bulkier N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)formamidine (DFFormH) gave divalent [Eu(DFForm)2(py)3] 5. In tetrahydrofuran (thf), the usual solvent for RTP reactions, C&#8722;F activation was observed for the first time with [Ag(C6F5)(py)] in such reactions. Thus trivalent [{Eu2(Ph2pz)4(py)4(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2}{Eu2(Ph2pz)4(py)2(thf)4(&#956;&#8208;F)2}] (6), [Eu2(ttfpz)4(py)2(dme)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (7), [Eu2(tBu2pz)4(dme)2(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (8) were obtained from the appropriate pyrazoles, the last two after crystallization from 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (dme). Surprisingly 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole (Me2pzH) gave the divalent cage [Eu6(Me2pz)10(thf)6(&#956;&#8208;F)2] (9). This has a compact ovoid core held together by bridging fluoride, thf, and pyrazolate ligands, the last including the rare &#956;4&#8208;1&#951;5(N2C3): 2&#951;2(N,N&#8242;): 3&#954;(N): 4&#954;(N&#8242;) pyrazolate binding mode. With the bulky N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)formamidine (DippFormH), which often favours C&#8722;F activation in RTP reactions, neither oxidation to EuIII nor C&#8722;F activation was observed and [Eu(DippForm)2(thf)2] (10) was isolated. By contrast, Eu reacted with Bi(C6F5)3 and Ph2pzH or tBu2pzH in thf without C&#8722;F activation, to give [Eu(Ph2pz)2(thf)4] (11) and [Eu(tBu2pz)3(thf)2] (12) respectively, the oxidation state outcomes corresponding to that for use of [Ag(C6F5)(py)] in pyridine.

Making the switch: This work disclosed the use of the Cu&#8722;Cu interaction of a mixed&#8208;valent tetrametallic copper complex (C&#8208;1) with a N&#8722;O&#8208;N Schiff base ligand for the generation of photoactive nanoscale copper [LCu0n, S&#8208;1] that showed stimuli (O2/light)&#8208;responsive switchable performance between its reduced (S&#8208;1) and oxidized [LCu0n&#8722;mCuOm, S&#8208;2] states, which serve as highly and poorly active (bistate, relative rate &gt;5&#8208; to 12&#8208;fold) catalyst to control two different antagonistic reactions.







Abstract
A discrete, photoactive, ultrafine copper nanocluster of fewer than hundreds of atoms with stimuli&#8208;responsive switchable redox&#8208;active states is highly desired to control two different antagonistic reactions. Herein, a mixed&#8208;valent tetrametallic copper complex (C&#8208;1) of N&#8722;O&#8208;N Schiff base ligand is disclosed, in which the five different Cu&#8722;Cu interactions were used to generate photoactive nanoscale copper [LCu0n, S&#8208;1] through the reduction of coordinated imine to the amine of C&#8208;1. The presence of a ligand provides stability and helps to homogenize the material (S&#8208;1) in the organic solvent. The cluster showed stimuli (O2/light)&#8208;responsive switching between its reduced (S&#8208;1) and oxidized [LCu0n&#8722;mCuOm, S&#8208;2] states that allows it to serve as a highly and poorly active (bistate, relative rate &gt;5&#8211;12 fold) catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes and hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to amino aromatics under the light.

         <title>The Significant Influence of a Second Metal on the Antiproliferative Properties of the Complex [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of a second metal (Zn, Co, or Ni) to a monometallic [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)] complex, which is obtained from deprotonation of [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(HdmoPTA)](OSO2CF3), had a significant influence and increased antiproliferative activity. Moreover, the bis&#8208;metallic complexes are selective as no reduction in normal cell viability is observed in their presence. On the other hand, the complexes display different properties and mechanisms of action depending on the nature of the second metal, M.







Abstract
Complexes [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(HdmoPTA)](OSO2CF3) (1), [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)] (2) and [Ru(&#951;6&#8722;C10H14)(Cl2)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;dmoPTA&#8208;1&#954;P:2&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;MCl2] (M=Zn (3), Co (4), Ni (5), dmoPTA=3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,7&#8208;triaza&#8208;5&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques. The crystal structures of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco&#8208;2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol. The monometallic ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were found to be inactive, but the bimetallic complexes 3, 4 and 5 display an increased activity (IC50 3: 9.07&#177;0.27, 4: 5.40&#177;0.19, 5: 7.15&#177;0.30&#8197;&#956;M) compared to cisplatin (IC50=45.6&#177;8.08&#8197;&#956;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of the complexes, such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies, were performed. The results showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH3NdmoPTA atoms.

         <title>Regulation of Electrocatalytic Activity by Local Microstructure: Focusing on the Catalytic Active Zone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored catalysts: Traditional design methods of catalytic active sites have successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in catalytic activity. The concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and helps develop new methodologies to control the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions. This review provides the research progress of this strategy in electrocatalytic reactions, with the emphasis on their important applications in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR).







Abstract
Traditional regulation methods of active sites have successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in the catalytic activity. Unlike the conventional viewpoint of focusing on single active site, the concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and new methods to regulate the reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions are developed accordingly. The local microstructure active zone refers to the zone with high catalytic activity formed by the interaction between active atoms and neighboring coordination atoms as well as the surrounding environment. Instead of the traditional single active atom site, the active zone is more suitable for the actual electrochemical reaction process. According to this concept, the activity of electrocatalysts can be coordinated by multiple active atoms. This strategy is beneficial for understanding the relationship between material, structure, and catalysis, which realizes the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. This review provides the research progress of this strategy for electrocatalytic reactions, with emphasis on their applications in oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction.

         <title>Fe&#8208;ZIF8 Coating Cu Foil Derived Carbon as A pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;universal electrocatalyst (Cu/Fe&#8722;NC) with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance is fabricated by pyrolyzing Fe&#8208;ZIF8 coated commercial Cu foil. Profiting from the synergistic effect of electronic distribution (such as Cu&#8594;Fe) and textual structure, the prepared Cu/Fe&#8722;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;cell (positive onset and half&#8208;wave potential) and zinc&#8208;air battery (high discharge voltage and good stability) performances to commercial Pt/C electrodes.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to fabricate highly efficient pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a facile strategy, which includes coating the Fe modified ZIF8 on Cu foil and in&#8197;situ pyrolysis to evaporate and dope Cu into the MOF derived carbon, is developed to fabricate Fe/Cu&#8722;N co&#8208;doped carbon material (Cu/Fe&#8722;NC). Profiting from the modulated electron distribution and textual properties, well&#8208;designed Cu/Fe&#8722;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.923&#8197;V in alkaline, 0.757&#8197;V in neutral and comparable 0.801&#8197;V in acid electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ultralow peroxides yield of ORR demonstrates the high selectivity of Cu/Fe&#8722;NC in full pH scale electrolytes. As expected, the self&#8208;made alkaline and neutral zinc&#8208;air batteries equipped with Cu/Fe&#8722;NC cathode display excellent discharge voltages, outstanding peak power densities and remarkable stability. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient and pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for ORR through strategy of Fe/Cu&#8722;N co&#8208;doping, Cu foil evaporation and carbon defects capture.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Dual&#8208;Responsive Iridium Probe for Saccharide Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal sensing: A luminescent iridium(III) complex, designed with boronic acid groups closely coupled to the metal centre, responds to sugar binding upon optical and electrochemical stimuli. The orange iridium luminescence signal is quenched by sugar binding in aqueous solutions at physiological pH. The signal is also observed in cancer cells, and is quenched by sugars at concentrations mimicking blood plasma. Hydrogel matrices with incorporated iridium complex retain the sensing response to sugars, providing an exemplar transition metal complex for saccharide&#8208;responsive devices.







Abstract
Dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in sensing systems and in&#8197;vitro testing. We introduce an IrIII complex with a boronic acid receptor site attached to the 2&#8208;phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo&#8208; and electrochemical signals that is sensitive to monosaccharide binding in aqueous solution. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618&#8197;nm, which is reduced by 70 and 40&#8201;% upon binding of fructose and glucose, respectively. The electro&#8208;chemiluminescent signal of the complex also shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The IrIII complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices as in solution, thus demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a nontoxic, simple&#8208;to&#8208;use tool to observe sugar binding over physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations. Moreover, the complex's luminescence is responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells.

&lt;p&gt;Dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in sensing systems and in&#8197;vitro testing. We introduce an Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex with a boronic acid receptor site attached to the 2-phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo- and electrochemical signals that is sensitive to monosaccharide binding in aqueous solution. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618&#8197;nm, which is reduced by 70 and 40&#8201;% upon binding of fructose and glucose, respectively. The electro-chemiluminescent signal of the complex also shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices as in solution, thus demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a nontoxic, simple-to-use tool to observe sugar binding over physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations. Moreover, the complex's luminescence is responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Allyl&#8722;Aryl Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling via Allylic C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of allylic difluorides with aryl iodides was achieved via allylic C&#8722;F bond activation. Based on this protocol, a series of &#947;&#8208;arylated monofluoroalkenes were synthesized in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;I bonds of the aryl iodides and the C&#8722;F bonds of the allylic difluorides were cleaved via oxidative addition and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination, respectively.

         <title>Highly Stable Univalent Copper of a Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 Nanocomposite Catalyzes the Synthesis of Fluorescent Aminobenzotriazoles Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene to benzotriazoles catalyzed by stable univalent copper of Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites is presented. A Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposite of stable univalent copper was prepared and used for a new catalytic synthesis strategy to synthesize a series of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties. In this strategy, there is no need to add other ligands and co&#8208;catalysts, the reaction time is short, the yield of products is high, and the catalyst can be reused many times without adding other related ligands and cocatalyst.







Abstract
With the development of green chemistry, it is still a challenge to maintain the unstable valence state of the metal in heterogeneous catalysts and realize new catalytic synthesis methods. In this paper, it is reported that an univalent copper nanocomposite (Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15) can efficiently catalyze the formation of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties in a new synthetic strategy. Subsequently, its application is further verified by an acylation reaction to produce a series of novel benzotriazoles derivatives with high yield. It is worth noting that the Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites not only enable the reaction completed with high yield in a short time, but can also be recycled many times without a significant reduction in activity, and the leaching of copper and aluminum species in reaction system is negligible. Finally, the detailed and feasible reaction mechanism is also provided.

         <title>Mn12&#8208;Acetate Complexes Studied as Single Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn12O12(RCOO)16 complexes have been the guinea pigs of research on single molecular magnets in the bulk and on surfaces before. Here, novel XMCD studies of isolated ionic samples with same Mn12 scaffolds yield magnetic fingerprints much like bulk samples. Advanced computations of single ion tensors find high anisotropies only on the outer MnIII8 ring. Intrinsic magnetic properties of the Mn12 scaffold seem robust against the environment.







Abstract
The phenomenon of single molecule magnet (SMM) behavior of mixed valent Mn12 coordination clusters of general formula [MnIII8MnIV4O12(RCOO)16(H2O)4] had been exemplified by bulk samples of the archetypal [MnIII8MnIV4O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (4) molecule, and the molecular origin of the observed magnetic behavior has found support from extensive studies on the Mn12 system within crystalline material or on molecules attached to a variety of surfaces. Here we report the magnetic signature of the isolated cationic species [Mn12O12(CH3COO)15(CH3CN)]+ (1) by gas phase X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy, and we find it closely resembling that of the corresponding bulk samples. Furthermore, we report broken symmetry DFT calculations of spin densities and single ion tensors of the isolated, optimized complexes [Mn12O12(CH3COO)15(CH3CN)]+ (1), [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16] (2), [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (3), and the complex in bulk geometry [MnIII8MnIV4O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (5). The found magnetic fingerprints &#8211; experiment and theory alike &#8211; are of a remarkable robustness: The MnIV4 core bears almost no magnetic anisotropy while the surrounding MnIII8 ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn12 core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.

         <title>Crystal Channel Engineering for Rapid Ion Transport: From Nature to Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion transport behaviours through cell membranes are commonly identified in biological systems, which are crucial for sustaining life for organisms. Similarly, ion transport is significant for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Rapid ion transport can be well achieved by crystal channels engineering, such as creating pores or tailoring interlayer spacing downwards nanometres or even sub&#8208;nanometre scales. Furthermore, some functional channels, such as ion selective channels and stimulus&#8208;responsive channels, are developed for smart ion storage applications. In this review, the typical ion transport phenomena in the biological systems, including ion channels and pumps, are first introduced, and then ion transport mechanisms in solid and liquid crystals are comprehensively reviewed, particularly for the widely studied porous inorganic/organic hybrid crystals and ultrathin inorganic materials. Subsequently, recent progress on the ion transport properties in electrodes and electrolytes is reviewed for rechargeable batteries. Finally, current challenges in the ion transport behaviours in rechargeable batteries are analysed and some potential research approaches, such as bioinspired ultrafast ion transport structures and membranes, are proposed for future studies. It is expected that this review can give a comprehensive understanding on the ion transport mechanisms within crystals and provide some novel design concepts on promoting electrochemical ion storage capability in rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C60 dyad as a photosensitizer for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C  60  dyad (  BP&#8208;C  60  ) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatments and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications.  BP&#8208;C  60  is constituted by a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a fullerene C  60  moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. BOPHY core works as a visible light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C  60  subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8208;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C  60  . Photodynamic studies indicate that  BP&#8208;C  60  produces ROS by both photomechanisms (Type I and Type II), even it presents a higher ROS production efficiency than its constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models demonstrated the capability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8208;fullerene C  60  dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency and relatively low cost. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in&#8208;situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacially Super&#8208;Assembled Benzimidazole Derivative&#8208;Based Mesoporous Silica Nanoprobe for Sensitive Copper (II) Detection and Biosensing in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with benzimidazole&#8208;derived fluorescent molecules (DHBM) are fabricated via a feasible interfacial superassembly strategy for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu  2+  . DHBM&#8208;MSN have an obvious quenching effect on Cu  2+  in aqueous solution, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10  &#8208;8  M. The DHBM&#8208;MSN solid&#8208;state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that using particles with different morphologies as carriers does not affect the specific detection function of nanoprobes. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental and density flooding theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu  2+  in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. The results indicate that the DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

Here, we developed a general protocol on metal&#8208;free P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8211;H borylation of phosphines mediated by BBr 3 , resulting in the formation of products bearing both phosphorus and boron. The development of the metal&#8208;free strategy to mimic previous metallic processes has shown low cost, superior practicality, and environmental friendliness.

         <title>Rhodium&#8211;Iodide Complex on Catalytically Active SiO2 Surface for One&#8208;pot Hydrosilylation&#8211;CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N  +  I  &#8208;  ) on SiO  2  . The SiO  2  &#8208;supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex, in the presence of ammonium cations, could be effectively  used for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxyolefins, hydrosilanes, and CO  2  . The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the reaction carried out for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N  +  I  &#8208;  ), respectively. The mechanism of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co&#8208;immobilized N  +  I  &#8208;  , was investigated using the Rh and I K&#8208;edge XAFS and XPS techniques. Analysis of the XAFS profiles indicated the presence of the Rh&#8211;I bond. The curve&#8208;fitting analysis of the Rh K&#8208;edge EXAFS profiles suggests the dissociation of the 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (COD) ligand from the Rh center. Results from spectroscopic and kinetic analyses revealed that the high activity of the catalyst (during hydrosilylation) could be attributed to the decrease in the steric hindrance and the electron&#8208;rich sate of the Rh. The decrease in the steric hindrance could be attributed to the absence of COD and the electron&#8208;rich state promoted the oxidative addition of Si&#8208;H. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example for the one&#8208;pot silylcarbonate synthesis as well as determination of a novel surface Rh&#8208;iodide complex and its catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Functionalization of anomeric base pairs in heterochiral DNA with strands in &#945;&#8208;D and &#946;&#8208;D configuration and homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration was performed. The &#945;&#8208;D anomers of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine were synthesized and functionalized with clickable octadiynyl side chains. Nucleosides were protected and converted to phosphoramidites. Solid&#8208;phase synthesis furnished 12&#8208;mer oligonucleotides which were hybridized. Pyrene click adducts display fluorescence, a few of them with excimer emission.  T  m  values and thermodynamic data revealed the following order of duplex stability &#945;/&#945;&#8208;D &gt;&gt; &#946;/&#946;&#8208;D &#8805; &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D. CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and spacious click adducts are well accommodated in grooves of anomeric DNA. The investigation shows for the first time that anomeric DNAs can be functionalized in the same way as canonical DNA for potential applications in nucleic acid chemistry, chemical biology and DNA material science.</dc:description>

T  m  values and thermodynamic data revealed the following order of duplex stability &#945;/&#945;-D &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &#946;/&#946;-D &#8805; &#945;/&#946;-D. CD spectra disclosed that conformational changes occur during hybridization. Functionalized DNAs were modeled and energy minimized. Clickable side chains and spacious click adducts are well accommodated in grooves of anomeric DNA. The investigation shows for the first time that anomeric DNAs can be functionalized in the same way as canonical DNA for potential applications in nucleic acid chemistry, chemical biology and DNA material science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoter&#8208;driven overexpression in Chromobacterium vaccinii facilitates access to FR900359 and yields novel low abundance analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR), a selective Gq/11 protein inhibitor of high pharmacological interest and a potential lead molecule for targeted therapy of cancers with oncogenic GNAQ or GNA11 mutations (encoding Gq and G11 respectively), has been challenging ever since its initial discovery more than three decades ago. The recent discovery of Chromobacterium vaccinii as a cultivable FR producer enables the development of approaches leading to a high&#8208;yielding, scalable and sustainable biotechnological process for production of FR, thereby removing this bottleneck. Here we characterize different promoters in exchange of the native promoter of the FR assembly line, resulting in an overexpression mutant with significantly increased production of FR. Thereby, the isolation and structure elucidation of novel FR analogs of low abundance is enabled. Further, we explore the antiproliferative activities of fifteen chromodepsins against uveal melanoma cell lines harboring Gq/11 mutations and characterize the major metabolite of FR formed in plasma.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilisation of CO2 as &#8220;Structure Modifier&#8221; of Inorganic Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilisation of CO  2  as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule&#8217;s inherent chemical stability. However, CO  2  reacts promptly at high temperature (~1000 &#176;C) with alkaline&#8208;earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re&#8208;utilisation. In this work, this concept is extended and CO  2  is utilised as a reagent to modify the crystal structure of mixed&#8208;metal inorganic solids. Modification of the crystal structure is a &#8220;tool&#8221; used by materials scientists to tailor the physical property of solids. CO  2  gas was reacted with several isostructural mixed&#8208;metal oxides Sr  2  CuO  3  , Sr  1.8  Ba  0.2  CuO  3  and Ba  2  PdO  3  . These oxides are carefully selected to show anion vacancies in their crystal structure, to act as host sites for CO  2  molecules, leading to the formation of carbonate anions, (CO  3  )  2&#8722;  . The corresponding oxide carbonates were formed successfully and the favourable formation of SrCO  3  as secondary phase was minimised via an innovative, yet simple synthetic procedure involving alternating of CO  2  and air. We also derived a simple model to predict the kinetics of the reactions for the cuprates, using first&#8208;principles density functional theory and assimilating the reaction to a gas&#8211;surface process.</dc:description>

         <title>Lights and Shadows of DMSO as Solvent for Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 2020 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ever&#8208;present solvent for tin halide perovskites, was identified as an oxidant for Sn  II  . Nonetheless, alternatives are lacking and few efforts have been devoted to replacing it. To understand this trend it is indispensable to learn the importance of DMSO on the development of tin halide perovskites. Its unique properties have allowed processing compact thin&#8208;films to be integrated into tin perovskite solar cells. Creative approaches for controlling the perovskite crystallization or increasing its stability to oxidation have been developed relying on DMSO&#8208;based inks. However, increasingly sophisticated strategies appear to lead the field to a plateau of power conversion efficiency in the range of 10&#8208;15%. And, while DMSO&#8208;based formulations have performed in encouraging means so far, we should also start considering their potential limitations. In this concept article, we discuss the benefits and limitations of DMSO&#8208;based tin perovskite processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Release of Molecular Cargo from Polymer Systems by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and manipulation of (multi)functional materials at the nanoscale holds the promise of fueling tomorrow&#8217;s major technological advances. In the realm of macromolecular nanosystems, the incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, so called mechanophores, has resulted in unprecedented access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. Among the diverse force&#8208;activated motifs, the on&#8208;demand release or activation of compounds, such as catalysts, drugs, or monomers for self&#8208;healing, are sought&#8208;after since they enable triggering pristine small molecule function from macromolecular frameworks. Here, we highlight examples of molecular cargo release systems from polymer&#8208;based architectures in solution by means of sonochemical activation by ultrasound (ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemistry). Important design concepts of these advanced materials are discussed, as well as their syntheses and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically synthesized, self&#8208;assembling small interfering RNA&#8208;prohead RNA molecules trigger Dicer&#8208;independent gene silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery  in vivo  . An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA&#8208;3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway  via  Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA&#8208;3WJs are substrates for Dicer  in vitro  . However, our results reveal that siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2&#8208;deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8217; of the 3WJ (5&#8217;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8217; of the 3WJ (3&#8217;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery  in vivo  . An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three-way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA-3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway  via  Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA-3WJs are substrates for Dicer  in vitro  . However, our results reveal that siRNA-3WJs transfected into Dicer-deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA-3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2-deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA-3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8217; of the 3WJ (5&#8217;-siRNA-3WJ) relative to 3&#8217; of the 3WJ (3&#8217;-siRNA-3WJ). This work sheds light on the functional properties of siRNA-3WJs and offers a design rule for maximizing their potency in the human RNAi pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  1  &#8208;methylation of pseudouridine (m  1  &#968;) replaces uridine in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m  1  &#968; is compared to that of uridine using photoirradiation at 267 nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m  1  &#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer  1  &#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both nucleosides decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m  1  &#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than uridine following irradiation at 267 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Heme&#8208;Iron&#8208;Mediated Selective Halogenation of Unactivated Carbon&#8722;Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slowly, but surely: The iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a chloride in cis position to the oxido group is an excellent model for non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron halogenases: it activates the very strong C&#8722;H bonds of cyclohexane and selectively leads to the halogenated product. Although it is the fastest iron(IV)&#8208;oxido model system known, formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting is the dominating reaction, and the halogenation itself therefore is a relatively slow but still selective process.







Abstract
Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L1)FeIICl2], where L1 is a tetradentate bispidine, with soluble iodosylbenzene (sPhIO) leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ with a cis disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands, as observed in non&#8208;heme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, the halogenation being initiated by C&#8722;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl&#8722;. The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from sPhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to &gt;70&#8201;% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe2+ and Fe3+ in comparison with [(L1)FeIICl2] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, [(L1)(Cl)FeIV=O]+ is the most reactive small&#8208;molecule halogenase model, that the FeIII/radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime (as supported by experimentally observed cage escape), and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product; this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fragile Diva: Trienone units and the elimination&#8208;prone hydroxy groups render pulvomycin D a capricious target, the total synthesis of which required a subtle endgame strategy, including a Heck reaction (3) and a sequential release of six silyl protecting groups combined with a Peterson elimination reaction (4). Earlier key steps of the synthesis included a diastereoselective aldol reaction (1) and a regioselective Yamaguchi esterification (2).







Abstract
A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Fragile Diva&lt;/b&gt;: Trienone units and the elimination-prone hydroxy groups render pulvomycin D a capricious target, the total synthesis of which required a subtle endgame strategy, including a Heck reaction (3) and a sequential release of six silyl protecting groups combined with a Peterson elimination reaction (4). Earlier key steps of the synthesis included a diastereoselective aldol reaction (1) and a regioselective Yamaguchi esterification (2).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24-C40 and the C8-C23 fragment. The remaining C1-C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22-membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26-C27 by a Peterson elimination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]perylene are described. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C24H12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]perylene, which was prepared by the fusion of one anthracene unit with one naphthalene unit via three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The synthetic route through two&#8208;fold C&#8722;H arylation enabled not only the synthesis of unsubstituted indenoperylene, but also rapid access to its arylated derivatives on the gram scale. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C24H12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents. We propose that the unique electronic structure of indenoperylene originates from the coexistence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing subunit (benzoaceanthrylene) and an electron&#8208;donating subunit (perylene). The electronic properties of indenoperylene were modulated via post&#8208;functionalization through regioselective bromination. The current research demonstrates that indenoperylene is a promising candidate as a main skeleton for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active materials.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Based Approach to Reagent Selection for Oxidative Carbon&#8722;Hydrogen Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selecting the optimal reagent for an oxidative C&#8722;H cleavage reaction requires mechanistic understanding of these processes. This manuscript describes an experimental approach to identify the role of substrate oxidation potential, cation stability, and steric factors on reaction rates and yields with common oxidants. The results are explained through computational transition state energetic and geometric analyses.







Abstract
Numerous hydride&#8208;abstracting agents generate the same cationic intermediate, but substrate features such as intermediate cation stability, oxidation potential, and steric environment can influence reaction rates in an oxidant&#8208;dependent manner. This manuscript provides experimental data to illustrate the role that structural features play in the kinetics of hydride abstraction reactions with commonly used quinone&#8208;, oxoammonium ion&#8208;, and carbocation&#8208; based oxidants. Computational studies of the transition state structures and energies explain these results and energy decomposition analysis calculations reveal unique sensitivities to electrostatic attraction and steric repulsions. Rigorous rate studies of select reactions validated the capacity of the calculations to predict reactivity trends. Additionally, kinetics studies demonstrate the potential for product inhibition in DDQ&#8208;mediated reactions. These studies provide a clear guide to select the optimal oxidant for structurally disparate substrates and lead to predictions of reactivity that were validated experimentally.

         <title>Orthogonal Catalysis for an Enantioselective Domino Inverse&#8208;Electron Demand Diels&#8722;Alder/Substitution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioether substituted trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalines have been accessed through a novel enantioselective domino process. Lewis acid activation and organocatalysis were combined to generate the products from readily available substances. A new chiral amine catalyst ensures high enantiomeric ratios. Both enantiomers of the product can be derived and the configuration on the newly generated stereo centers were unambiguously related to the chirality of the amine.







Abstract
An enantioselective domino process for the synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes has been developed by the combination of chiral amines and a bidentate Lewis acid in an orthogonal catalysis. This new method is based on an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder and a subsequent group exchange reaction. An enamine is generated in&#8197;situ from an aldehyde and a chiral secondary amine catalyst that reacts with phthalazine, activated by the coordination to a bidentate Lewis acid catalyst. The absolute configuration of the product is controlled by chiral information provided by the amine. The formed ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediate is then transformed via a group exchange reaction with thiols. The new method shows a broad scope and tolerates a wide range of functional groups with enantiomeric ratios up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9. All&#8208;in&#8208;all, this enantioselective synthesis tool provides an easy access to complex 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes starting from readily available phthalazine, aldehydes and thiols in a combinatorial way.

         <title>An Isolable Gallium&#8208;Substituted Nitrilimine and its Reactivity with B&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H and B&#8722;B Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of diazomethane N2CHSiMe3 with the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa affords the nitrilimine complex 10 that undergoes 1,3&#8208;addition reactions with silane and borane to give products 16 and 17 but an unusual 1,1&#8208;addition of diborane (Bcat)2 (cat=catecholate) to give the diborylamide compound 18. DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of formation of compound 9 and 18.







Abstract
Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (9) with the diazo compound N2CHSiMe3 affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N&#8208;NCSiMe3)(CH2SiMe3) (10). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8722;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe3 but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe3)(CN2SiMe3) (13) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe3)(N(NC)SiMe3) (15). Reactions of 10 with the silane H3SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ERn)NCSiMe3}(CH2SiMe3), whereas reaction with the diborane B2cat2 gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8722;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of 9 with N2CHSiMe3 proceeds through intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N2CHSiMe3. Insertion into the B&#8722;B bond likely proceeds through an initial 1,3&#8208;addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.

         <title>Uranium(IV) Thio&#8208; and Selenoether Complexes: Syntheses, Structures, and Computational Investigation of U&#8722;ER2 Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinide&#8211;soft donor linkages are of importance in the context of lanthanide&#8208;actinide separation. The first example of a uranium selenoether complex has been prepared through the use of a rigid SeNSe&#8208;donor pincer ligand. The thioether analogue was also synthesized. Computational studies, including NBO, AIM and ELF calculations, revealed increasing covalency in U&#8722;ER2 bonding from O to S to Se.







Abstract
Rigid thioether&#8208; and selenoether&#8208;containing pincer proligands H[AS2
] (1) and H[ASe2
] (2) were synthesized, and deprotonation provided the potassium salts [K(AS2
)(dme)] (3) and [K(ASe2
)(dme)2] (4). Reaction of two equivalents of 3 or 4 with [UI4(dioxane)2] afforded the uranium thioether complex [(AS2
)2UI2] (5) and the first example of a uranium&#8208;selenoether complex, [(ASe2
)2UI2] (6). X&#8208;ray structures revealed distorted square antiprismatic geometries in which the AE2
 ligands are &#954;3&#8208;coordinated. The nature of the U&#8722;ER2 bonding in 5 and 6, as well as methyl&#8208;free analogues of 5 and 6 and a hypothetical ether analogue, was investigated computationally (including NBO, AIM, and ELF calculations) illustrating increasing covalency from O to S to Se.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Anions and Secondary Coordination Sphere in Tuning Anisotropy in Dy(III) Air&#8208;Stable D5h SIMs**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Bigger the better! The change of hydrogen&#8208;bonded halide anions in the secondary coordination sphere of a pseudo&#8208;D5h Dy(III) single&#8208;ion magnet shows a subtle alteration in the magnetic properties. The Ueff, TB and coercivity decrease in the order I&gt;Br&gt;Cl through change of anions in the secondary coordination sphere from larger iodide to smaller chloride ions.







Abstract
Precise control of the crystal field and symmetry around the paramagnetic spin centre has recently facilitated the engineering of high&#8208;temperature single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs), the smallest possible units for future spin&#8208;based devices. In the present work, we report a series of air&#8208;stable seven coordinate Dy(III) SIMs {[L2Dy(H2O)5][X]3&#8901;L2&#8901;n(H2O), n = 0, X = Cl (1), n=1, X = Br (2), I (3)} possessing pseudo&#8208;D5h symmetry or pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry with high anisotropy energy barrier (Ueff) and blocking temperature (TB). While the strong axial coordination from the sterically encumbered phosphonamide, tBuPO(NHiPr)2 (L), increases the overall anisotropy of the system, the presence of high symmetry significantly quenches quantum tunnelling of magnetization, which is the prominent deactivating factor encountered in SIMs. The energy barrier (Ueff) and the blocking temperature (TB) decrease in the order 3&gt;2&gt;1 with the change of anions from larger iodide to smaller strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded chloride in the secondary coordination sphere, albeit the local coordination geometry and the symmetry around the Dy(III) display only slight deviations. Ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO/SINGLE_ANISO calculations provide deeper insights into the dynamics of magnetic relaxation in addition to the role of the secondary coordination sphere in modulating the anisotropy of the D5h systems, using diverse models. Thus, in addition to the importance of the crystal field and the symmetry to obtain high&#8208;temperature SIMs, this study also probes the significance of the secondary coordination sphere that can be tailored to accomplish novel SIMs.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetra&#173;fluoro&#173;tetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;penta&#173;fluoro&#173;&#173;tetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mn2+&#160;doped colloidal three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) has&#160;attracted intensive research attention, however, the low exciton binding energy and fatal optical instability of 3D PNC seriously hinder the optoelectronic application. Therefore, it remains significant to explore new stable host perovskite with strongly bound exciton to realize more desirable luminescent property. In this work, we utilized bulk one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid perovskite of [AEP]PbBr5&#8729;H2O (AEP = N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine) as structural platform to rationally optimize the luminescent property by controllable Mn2+&#160;doping strategy. Significantly, the serial Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D [AEP]PbBr5&#8729;H2O show enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the strongly bound excitons of host material to 3d&#160;electrons of Mn2+&#160;ions, resulting in tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range&#160;with highest photoluminescence quantum yield up to 28.41%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskite as excellent down&#8208;converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high&#8208;performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid&#8208;state lighting and displaying devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrodeposition of Defect&#8208;rich Ternary NiCoFe Layered Double Hydroxides: Fine Modulation of Co3+ for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;abundance and durable layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the easy agglomeration of lamellar LDHs in the aqueous phase limits their practical applications. Herein, a series of ternary NiCoFe LDHs were successfully fabricated on nickel foam (NF)  via  a simple electrodeposition method. The as&#8208;prepared Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF displayed an unique nanoarray structural feature. It showed an OER overpotential of 209 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  in alkaline solution, which was superior to most systems reported so far. As evidenced by the XPS and XAFS results, such excellent performance of Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF was attributed to the higher Co  3+  /Co  2+  ratio and more defects exposed, comparing with Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )&#8208;bulk and Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )&#8208;mono LDHs prepared by conventional coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the ratio of Co to Fe could significantly tune the Co electronic structure of Ni(Co  x  Fe  1&#8208;x  )/NF composites (x = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) and affect the electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which Ni(Co  0.5  Fe  0.5  )/NF showed the lowest energy barrier for OER rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*). This work proposes a facile method to develop high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Spin Coupling Controls the Gas&#8208;Phase Reactivity of Aromatic &#963;&#8208;Type Triradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Who&#8242;s first? Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site.

Abstract
Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site, in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most electron&#8208;deficient radical site. Abstraction of one or two H atoms and formation of an ion that formally corresponds to a combination of the ion and cyclohexane accompanied by elimination of a H atom (&#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221;) were observed. In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is intrinsically less reactive than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the first H atom abstraction either dissociates to give the H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product sometimes adds to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221; products. Similar reaction efficiencies were measured for three of the triradicals as for relevant monoradicals. Surprisingly, the remaining three triradicals (all containing a meta&#8208;pyridyne moiety) reacted substantially faster than the relevant monoradicals. This is likely due to the exothermic generation of a meta&#8208;pyridyne analog that has enough energy to attain the dehydrocarbon atom separation common for H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction transition states of protonated meta&#8208;pyridynes.

&lt;p&gt;Examination of the reactions of &#963;-type quinolinium-based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site, in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most electron-deficient radical site.

In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is intrinsically less reactive than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the first H atom abstraction either dissociates to give the H-atom-abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product sometimes adds to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition-H&#8221; products.

         <title>Nanostructured Manganese Oxides within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate Exhibiting Unusual Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanosized manganese oxides have recently received considerable attention for their synthesis, structures, and potential applications. Although various synthetic methods have been developed, precise synthesis of novel nanostructured manganese oxides are still challenging. In this study, using a structurally defined nanosized cavity inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides,  Mn18  and  Mn20  , respectively. In particular,  Mn18  showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the oxygenation of alkylarenes including electron&#8208;deficient ones, and the reaction proceeded through a unique reaction mechanism due to its unusual manganese oxide structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Micro&#8208;mesoporous carbons from cyclodextrin nanosponges enabling high capacity silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes for lithiated Si&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. We daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host strengthens the interaction with sulfur and limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. Finally, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8208;S cell.</dc:description>

         <title>H2S Dosimetry by CuO: Towards Stable Sensors by Unravelling the Underlying Solid&#8208;State Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)oxide and copper(II)sulfide nanostructures are prepared for a detailed investigation of the dosimetric sensing mechanism of hydrogensulfide, aiming at an improvement of the long&#8208;term stability of these sensors. Based on the received insights a long&#8208;term stability in more than 250 sensing and regeneration cycles is achieved.







Abstract
The precise detection of the toxic gas H2S requires reliable sensitivity and specificity of sensors even at minute concentrations of as low as 10&#8197;ppm, the value corresponding to typical exposure limits. CuO can be used for H2S dosimetry, based on the formation of conductive CuS and the concomitant significant increase in conductance. In theory, at elevated temperature the reaction is reversed and CuO is formed, ideally enabling repeated and long&#8208;term use of one sensor. Yet, the performance of CuO tends to drop upon cycling. Utilizing defined CuO nanorods we thoroughly elucidated the associated detrimental chemical changes directly on the sensors, by Raman and electron microscopy analysis of each step during sensing (CuO&#8594;CuS) and regeneration (CuS&#8594;CuO) cycles. We find the decrease in the sensing performance is mainly caused by the irreversible formation of CuSO4 during regeneration. The findings allowed us to develop strategies to reduce CuSO4 formation and thus to substantially maintain the sensing stability even for repeated cycles. We achieved CuO&#8208;based dosimeters possessing a response time of a few minutes only, even for 10&#8197;ppm H2S, and prolonged life&#8208;time.

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl and N&#8208;Alkyl Carbamates from 1 Atmosphere of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have isolated and analyzed the reactivity of the key intermediate 1 formed during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates starting from amines, CO2, and Si(OMe)4. The reaction mechanism was analyzed by using DFT. The catalytic system was modified and various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates that could be used as industrially important polyurethane raw materials were synthesized by using atmospheric CO2.







Abstract
We have successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)4. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of 1 with Si(OMe)4 proceeds via a five&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)4 as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the five&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO2 under atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Relationship Between Molecular Structure, Single crystal Packing and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior: A Case Based on Pyrene Imide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized. These materials showed different self&#8208;assembly morphologies with different conjugation degree or alkyl group. Single&#8208;crystal packing revealed that the change of molecular structure would affect certain crystal lattice parameter, such as intermolecular distance, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.







Abstract
Development of new n&#8208;type one&#8208;dimensional (1D) self&#8208;assembly nanostructure and a clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and self&#8208;assembly behavior are important prerequisites for further designing and optimizing organic optoelectronic nanodevice. In this article, a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized through [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and their preliminary optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The simulated HOMO&#8208;LUMO bandgaps via DFT tallied with the experimental data well. The self&#8208;assembly of these materials showed needle or fiber&#8208;like morphologies, indicating that different conjugation degree or alkyl group had significant influence on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Furthermore, the single&#8208;crystal packing for these molecules were analyzed and it was found out that the changes of conjugated backbone and functional group would affect certain crystal lattice parameter significantly, such as the intermolecular packing distance and crystal size etc, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN Peptide Complexes Increases ROS Levels, DNA Cleavage and Antiproliferative Activity**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of reactive oxygen species was achieved with a redox&#8208;silent Cu(II) ATCUN complex by replacing the &#945;&#8208;amino acid glycine with &#946;&#8208;alanine. Increased ROS production led to higher oxidative DNA cleavage activity. The reasons for this higher activity were elucidated via potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, UV/VIS spectroscopy and DFT. In cytotoxicity assays, &#946;&#8208;alanine peptide complexes showed lower IC50 values in several cancer cell lines compared with the glycine analogs, which could be correlated with the amounts of Cu taken up by cells.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et&#8197;al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore leads to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2&#8594;&#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production (&#8226;OH and H2O2). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forced into proximity: The 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold is introduced as a model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding interaction.

Abstract
The 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;6,7&#8208;ethylenedioxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold is presented as a novel model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction. In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (dH,F&#8764;2.0&#8197;&#197;, &#8736;&#8764;138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (1hJNH,F) of 19&#177;1&#8197;Hz. A combination of experimental (NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) were used for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, the effects of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling were investigated. This scaffold was used for the direct comparison of fluoride with methoxy as HB acceptors, and the susceptibility of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance was probed by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. The results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated through additive and linear electronic substituent effects.

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of benzothiazine heterocycles starting from thioureas has been achieved. With gold catalysis, these organic compounds evolved in basic medium towards the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment.







Abstract
New benzothiazine heterocycles have been formed from thiourea derivatives by using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions were optimised towards the selective synthesis of six&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold&#8208;derived species have a great potential for biological applications.

         <dc:description>
The nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx exhibited prominent &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; cascaded catalytic enzyme activities including catalase, peroxidase, glutathione oxidase and glucose oxidase. The ingenious Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could significantly induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor regions; this results in a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; enzyme cascade that is lethal to cervical cancer. All in all, Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx can act as a high&#8208;performance and safe bioactive material for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of the reproductive system, seriously threatens women&#8216;s life and health, and is difficult to be cured by traditional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed a &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, Cu2&#8208;xSe with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H2O2 in cancer cells into O2. Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose with the assistance of O2; this not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H2O2 to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic .OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu2&#8208;xSe. Moreover, although the free&#8208;radical scavenger glutathione (GSH) is overexpressed in tumor cells, Cu2&#8208;xSe with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could induce significant ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, thus providing a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.

         <dc:description>
Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by substitution of [AlO4] for [BO4] covalent tetrahedra from &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10. Anionic&#8208;group architectures are transformed from a two&#8208;dimensional double layer to a three&#8208;dimensional framework.







Abstract
Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method. They crystallize in the different space groups, P21/c and P2/c, respectively. The B&#8722;O configurations of &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 are compared to feature complicated different dimensional open&#8208;framework structures caused by the substitution of [BO4] by [AlO4] covalent tetrahedra. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges (&lt;187&#8197;nm). The first&#8208;principles calculations show that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have moderate birefringence (0.075 and 0.041@1064&#8197;nm, respectively).

         <title>Monitoring the Thiol/Thiophenol Molecule&#8208;Modulated Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Silver Oxidation with Dark&#8208;Field Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol/thiophenol molecules can modulate the plasmon&#8208;mediated silver oxidation. Compared with molecules having electron donating groups, molecules having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The modulation of silver oxidation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules.







Abstract
Surface plasmon can trigger or accelerate many photochemical reactions, especially useful in energy and environmental industries. Recently, molecular adsorption has proven effective in modulating plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, however the realized chemical reactions are limited and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Herein, by using in&#8197;situ dark&#8208;field optical microscopy, the plasmon&#8208;mediated oxidative etching of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), a typical hot&#8208;hole&#8208;driven reaction, is monitored continuously and quantitatively. The presence of thiol or thiophenol molecules is found essential in the silver oxidation. In addition, the rate of silver oxidation is modulated by the choice of different thiol or thiophenol molecules. Compared with the molecules having electron donating groups, the ones having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The thiol/thiophenol modulation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular adsorption in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, which will pave a new way for developing highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.

         <title>Structural and functional analysis of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids and rosette&#8208;inducing factor 2 (RIF&#8208;2) by mass spectrometry&#8208;guided isolation and total synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyzed the abundance of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids, including rosette&#8208;inducing (RIFs) factors, in seven bacterial prey strains using high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS  2  ) and molecular networking (MN) within the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) web platform. Isolation and structure elucidation of six sulfonosphingolipids resembling RIFs was accomplished based on comparative MS and NMR studies. Here, we also report the first total synthesis of two RIF&#8208;2 diastereomers and one congener in 15 and eight synthetic steps, respectively. For the total synthesis of RIF&#8208;2 congeners, we employed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize the necessary branched a&#8211;hydroxy fatty acids, and the Garner&#8208;aldehyde approach to generate the capnine base carrying three stereogenic centers. Bioactivity studies in the choanoflagellate  Salpingoeca rosetta  revealed that rosette inducing activity of RIFs is inhibited dose&#8208;dependently by the co&#8208;occuring sulfonosphingolipid sulfobacin D and F and that activity of RIFs is specific for isolates obtained from  Algoriphagus  .</dc:description>

         <title>Weinreb Amide, Ketone and Amine as Potential and Competitive Secondary Molecular Stations for Dibenzo&#8208;[24]Crown&#8208;8 in [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical way to bistable molecular shuttles that hold a combination of amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone as secondary stations for dibenzo&#8208;[24]crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) is reported. Ketone and amine moieties have similar affinity for DB24C8 that is better than the Weinreb amide has. Hydrogen bonds between DB24C8 and an unhindered axle usually favor a co&#8208;conformation; unless steric restrictions, hence the constrained co&#8208;conformation, impose a predominance of alternative and unexpected even weaker H&#8208;bonds. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gauthier and F. Coutrot (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103805).

         <dc:description>The long&#8208;standing history of platinum coordination complexes in nucleic acid recognition attests to the unique suitability of such species for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthetic exploration and development of a family of di&#8208;imine ligands, and their platinum(II) complexes, elaborated on a 3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;  a  ]pyridine platform which, in its unsubstituted form, has recently been shown to display exceptional capabilities for guanine quadruplex (G4) targeting. The identification of facile, high&#8208;yielding synthetic methods for the derivatization of this platform for the incorporation of additional sites of interactions with guanine quadruplex loops and grooves, along with the optimization of platinum(II) complexation methods, are discussed. Gratifyingly, preliminary biophysical screening of this novel family of binders validates all but one family members as robust G4 binders, and highlights enhanced selectivity for quadruplex  vs  duplex DNA compared to the parent compound. These results bear promise for practical developments based on this platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the enormous importance of&#160;insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by&#160;polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases&#160;in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of&#160;Zr(IV) and Hf(IV)&#160;substituted Keggin&#8208;type&#160;polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2]&#160;(M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in tertiary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by electrical conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carriers separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under the organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene):[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT:PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50 mV to 0.65 V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8208;1 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and cocatalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110 &#956;A cm&#8208;2 and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathode.</dc:description>

These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional syntheses of the 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on the neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement of a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here we disclose a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with twelve (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and thirteen alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative naturally occurring triterpene saponins are thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicate that the present glycosylation proceeds via a SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8208;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species which activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8208; ensures a non&#8208;interruptive role for the glycosidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiroconjugated Tetraaminospirenes as Donors in Color&#8208;tunable Charge&#8208;transfer Emitters with Donor&#8208;acceptor Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer emitters are attractive due to their color tunability and potentially high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). We herein present tetraaminospirenes as donor moieties, which, in combination with a variety of acceptors, furnished 12 chargetransfer emitters with a range of emission colors and PLQYs of up to 99%. The spatial separation of their frontier molecular orbitals was obtained through careful structural design, and two DA structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A range of photophysical measurements supported by DFT calculations shed light on the optoelectronic properties of this new family of spiro&#8208;NN&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Activation of Unsaturated Amides with Schwartz's Reagent: A Diastereoselective Access to Cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;Dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concomitant generation of a nucleophilic and an electrophilic site from unsaturated Weinreb amide by using Cp2Zr(H)Cl) as the unique reagent was developed to promote a cyclisation reaction. The access to trans&#8208;2&#8208;substituted cyclopentanols or cyclopentylhydroxylamines can be selectively driven by a judicious choice of the cyclisation promotor. An access to cis&#8208;3&#8208;substituted is also described.







Abstract
The diastereoselective access to cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines from 4&#8208;pentenoic acid&#8208;derived Weinreb amides is described. Based on the concomitant generation of both the nucleophilic and the electrophilic poles by hydrozirconation of the amide and the C=C double bond, the cyclisation may be tuned towards cyclopentanols or N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines depending on the ring&#8208;closure promotor. An extension to cis 3&#8208;substituted N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylhydroxylamines is also presented.

         <title>TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers: A New Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) is proposed to realize efficient circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) by taking TADF molecule as sensitizer to improve exciton utilization and CP&#8208;FL molecule as emitter to realize CPEL. In this article, we highlight the research status of CPEL and CP&#8208;TADF, mainly focus on the concept of TSCP and its applications in CP&#8208;OLEDs, and finally give the prospects of TSCP in CPEL research area.







Abstract
A promising strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been proposed for improving the electroluminescence efficiencies of circularly polarized fluorescent emitters. Compared with chiral TADF emitters which suffer from the dilemma of small &#916;EST accompanied by small kr, the TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) strategy using TADF molecules as sensitizers and CP&#8208;FL molecules as emitters might be the most promising method to construct high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Consequently, by taking advantage of the theoretically 100&#8201;% exciton utilization of TADF sensitizers, especially, by designing CP&#8208;FL emitters with high PLQY, narrow FWHM and large glum values, TSCP&#8208;type CP&#8208;OLEDs with excellent overall performances can be realized.

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and Perfluoroheteroaryl Reagents as Emerging New Tools for Peptide Synthesis, Modification and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroaromatic and perfluoroheteroaromatic reagents have emerged in recent years as powerful reagents for peptide and protein modification. Dominated by their regio&#8208; and chemoselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution chemistry under mild conditions, they have been used in peptide synthesis, tagging, cyclisation, stapling and protein bioconjugation.







Abstract
Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Perfluoroaromatic and perfluoroheteroaromatic reagents have emerged in recent years as powerful reagents for peptide and protein modification. Dominated by their regio- and chemoselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution chemistry under mild conditions, they have been used in peptide synthesis, tagging, cyclisation, stapling and protein bioconjugation.

         <title>A Series of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Viologen Photochromic Materials for UV Probing, Amine Detecting and Inkless and Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three polyoxometalate&#8208;viologen Compounds&#8197;were designed and constructed by using two viologen ligands. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic features with fast photoresponse under irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. These Compounds&#8197;exhibit amine detecting and inkless and erasable printing properties, and they can be prepared into a mixed matrix film as a good UV detector.







Abstract
In this work, by using two kinds of viologen ligands three POM&#8208;based Compounds&#8197;were obtained under hydrothermal conditions, namely [AgI(bmypd)0.5(&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (1) (bmypd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2Cl=1,1&#8242;&#8208;[Biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(methylene)]bis(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium)dichloride), [AgI2(bypy)4(HSiW12O40)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (2) and [AgI(bypy)(&#947;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (3) (bypy&#8901;Cl=1&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium chloride). The structures were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8211;IR), Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic ability with fast photoresponse under the irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. So compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as visible ultraviolet detectors. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also possess photoluminescence properties with fast and excellent fluorescence quenching effect. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also can be used as inkless and erasable printing materials with suspensions of 1&#8211;3 applied to filter paper. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can also produce color changes in amine vapor environment, especially in an NH3 atmosphere. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as organic amine detectors.

         <dc:description>
Aryl nitriles from oxazolines: We report a new method for for preparing highly functionalized tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;substituted aromatic nitriles by using two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with a broad range of electrophiles followed by an efficient conversion of the oxazolyl&#8208;directing group to a nitrile function by using oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h).







Abstract
A selective ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;functionalization of readily available aryl oxazolines by two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with electrophiles, such as (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides, iodine, tosyl cyanide, ethyl cyanoformate or allylic bromides (39 examples, 62&#8211;99&#8201;% yield) is reported. Treatment of these aryl oxazolines with excess oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h) provided the corresponding nitriles (36 examples, 73&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). Conversions of these nitriles to valuable heterocycles are reported, and a tentative mechanism is proposed.

         <dc:description>
Copolymerizing N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs in nonpolar solutions affords helical, H&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure. In contrast, in bulk, lamellar structures form and long&#8208;range order is lost. This is a result of the antiparallel H&#8208;bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs, which are less stable than the parallel H&#8208;bonds formed in the homopolymers.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) has been conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate the copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.

         <title>Steric Repulsion Induced Conformational Switch in Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strain engineering of dodecasubstituted picket&#8208;fence porphyrins led us to develop a method for selective atropisomeric conversion based on the steric clashes. The tension rigidified architecture revealed distinct spectroscopic alterations with vibrant colorimetric changes making it a first case study where the porphyrin&#8208;based photometric response is induced only by atropisomer configurations.







Abstract
Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket&#8208;fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain to impose intramolecular tension in already peripherally overcrowded structures leading to selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tuneable shape&#8208;persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The intrinsic assemblies driven by non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions form supramolecular polymers while encapsulating small molecules in parallel channels or solvent&#8208;accessible voids. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies combined with synthetic approaches have allowed the introduction of the pivalate units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in the absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions between the peripheral groups which were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket-fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain to impose intramolecular tension in already peripherally overcrowded structures leading to selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tuneable shape-persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The intrinsic assemblies driven by non-covalent bonding interactions form supramolecular polymers while encapsulating small molecules in parallel channels or solvent-accessible voids. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies combined with synthetic approaches have allowed the introduction of the pivalate units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in the absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions between the peripheral groups which were confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazole and Its Kuratowski Complex: A &#960;&#8208;Extended Tecton for Supramolecular and Coordinative Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional structures can be assembled from &#960;&#8208;extended triazoles, which act as versatile tectons capable of metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Infinite stacks of cyclic hydrogen&#8208;bonded tetrads or triads are obtained in the crystal, with substitution controlling the size of the assembly. In spite of their bulkiness, &#960;&#8208;extended triazoles easily form pentanuclear zinc(II) Kuratowski complexes, characterized by concave outer surfaces and moderate solid&#8208;state porosity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Extended acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, the unsubstituted Anta&#8208;H and its di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl derivative Dibanta&#8208;H, as well as 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazole Cybta&#8208;H were obtained in concise syntheses. In the solid state, Dibanta&#8208;H forms an unprecedented hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic tetrad, stabilized by dispersion interactions of the bulky tBu substituents, whereas a cyclic triad was found in the crystal structure of Anta&#8208;H. These cyclic assemblies form infinite slipped stacks in the crystals. Evidence for analogous hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assembly in solution was provided by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and computational analyses. Kuratowski&#8208;type pentanuclear complexes [Zn5Cl4(Dibanta)6] and [Zn5Cl4(Cybta)6] were prepared from the respective triazoles. In the Dibanta complexes, the &#960;&#8208;aromatic surfaces of the ligands extend from the edges of the tetrahedral Zn5 core, yielding an enlarged structure with significant internal molecular free volume and red&#8208;shifted fluorescence.

         <title>Developing Efficient Small Molecule Acceptors with sp2&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen at Different Positions by Density Functional Theory Calculations, Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidimensional modelling is performed to envision the structural changes at atomic and molecular level. sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen is substituted at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of ITIC for improving the device performance. It is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.







Abstract
Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. In current study, the effect of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.

Large&#8208;but&#8208;flexible palladium precatalysts have been rationally designed to enable the challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of coordinating heterocycles. This robust new class of precatalysts permits cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of heterocycles with aryl, alkyl and heteroarylamines, including historically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles as well as electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles containing multiple heteroatoms, under practical aerobic conditions. Studies on the ligand structure and electronic properties of the carbene center are also reported.

         <title>PTFE/EP Reinforced MOF/SiO2 Composite as a Superior Mechanically Robust Superhydrophobic Agent towards Corrosion Protection, Self&#8208;Cleaning and Anti&#8208;Icing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The robust, highly durable and multi&#8208;functional superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated by spray coating technique on various substrates, including metals and non&#8208;metals such as steel 304, steel 306&#8197;L, fiber, cardboard, and glass.







Abstract
Organic resin cross&#8208;linking ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2 superhydrophobic (SHPB) multilayer coating was successfully fabricated on metal substrate. The perfluoro&#8208;octyl&#8208;triethoxy silane (POTS) modified ZIF&#8208;67 and SiO2 coating was applied on primary coated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and epoxy resin (EP) via spray coating method. Here, we present that the robust superhydrophobicity can be realized by structuring surfaces at two different length scales, with a nanostructure design to provide water repellence and a microstructure design to provide durability. The as&#8208;fabricated multilayer coating displayed superior water&#8208;repellence (CA=167.4&#176;), chemical robustness (pH=1&#8211;14) and mechanical durability undergoing 120th linear abrasion or 35th rotatory abrasion cycle. By applying different acidic and basic corrosive media and various weathering conditions, it can still maintain superior&#8208;hydrophobicity. To get a better insight of interaction between inhibitor molecules and metal surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, showing lower energy gap and increased binding energy of ZPS/SiO2/PTFE/EP (ZPS=ZIF&#8208;67+POTS) multilayer coating compared to the ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2/PTFE/EP, thereby supporting the experimental findings. Additionally, such coatings may be useful for applications such as anti&#8208;corrosion, self&#8208;cleaning, and anti&#8208;icing multi&#8208;functionalities.

Four novel Ir(III) photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) were synthesized and applied for photocatalytic cancer therapy. Upon blue and green light irradiation, these photocatalysts generated singlet oxygen and induced rapid photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of the cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir2 triggered promising photo&#8208;induced anticancer activity via induction of intracellular redox imbalance and exhibited ideal in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity.







Abstract
Four photo&#8208;catalysts of the general formula [Ir(CO6/ppy)2(L)]Cl where CO6=coumarin 6 (Ir1&#8211;Ir3), ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine (Ir4), L=4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir1), 4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir2 and Ir4), and 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (Ir3) were synthesized and characterized. These photostable photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir3) showed strong visible light absorption between 400&#8211;550&#8197;nm. Upon light irradiation (465 and 525&#8197;nm), Ir1&#8211;Ir3 generated singlet oxygen and induced rapidly photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir1&#8211;Ir3 showed time&#8208;dependent cellular uptake with excellent intracellular retention efficiency. Upon green light irradiation (525&#8197;nm), Ir2 provided a much higher photo&#8208;index (PI=793) than the clinically used photosensitizer, 5&#8208;aminolevulinicacid (5&#8208;ALA, PI&gt;30) against HeLa cancer cells. The observed necro&#8208;apoptotic anticancer activity of Ir2 was due to the Ir2 triggered photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance (by NAD(P)H oxidation and ROS generation) and change in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Remarkably, Ir2 showed in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity in mouse models.

         <title>Crown Ether Host&#8208;Guest Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics are attractive for the host&#8208;guest structure, where the guest cation is anchored in the host crown ether and the anion acts as the counterion. Their crystal structure, phase transition and ferroelectric properties are discussed in this minireview. Additionally, an outlook on the chemical design of high&#8208;performance crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics is given.







Abstract
In recent years, molecular ferroelectrics have received great attention due to their low weight, mechanical flexibility, easy preparation and excellent ferroelectric properties. Among them, crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics, which are typically composed of the host crown ethers, the guest cations anchored in the crown ethers, and the counterions, are of great interest because of the host&#8208;guest structure. Such a structure allows the components to occur order&#8208;disorder transition easily, which is beneficial for inducing ferroelectric phase transition. Herein, we summarized the research progress of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics, focusing on their crystal structure, phase transition, ferroelectric&#8208;related properties. In view of the small spontaneous polarization and uniaxial nature, we outlook the chemical design strategies for obtaining high&#8208;performance crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics. This minireview will be of guiding significance for the future exploration of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents the recent advances of our laboratory towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid / electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimodal fluorescence/magnetic resonance molecular probes with extended spin lifetimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimodal molecular probes combining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence have been widely studied in basic science as well as clinical research. The investigation of spinphenomena holds promise to broaden the scope of available probes allowing for deeper insights into physiological processes. Here, we are introducing a class of molecules with a bimodal character with respect to fluorescence and nuclear spin singlet states. Singlet states are NMR silent but can be probed indirectly. We report on symmetric, perdeuterated molecules in which the singlet states can be populated via vanishingly small electron&#8208;mediated couplings (below 1 Hz). The lifetimes of these states are an order of magnitude longer than the longitudinal relaxation times and up to 4 minutes at 7 T. Moreover, these molecules show either aggregation induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) with respect to their fluorescence. In the latter case, we observed the existence of excited dimers which we propose to use in a switchable manner in combination with the quenching of nuclear spin singlet states.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Gold Nanoclusters: Synthesis Strategies, Optical Properties, and Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. The intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels endowed them with fascinating electronical and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the field of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, bio&#8208;sensing, bio&#8208;imaging and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most Au NCs are synthesized in organic solvents and are insoluble in aqueous solution, which restricted their biological applications. In this review, we focused on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;soluble Au NCs and their biological applications. We first reviewed their synthetic methods, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic Au NCs. We then discussed their photophysical properties such as emission enhancement and their influence factors. We next summarized their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outlined the challenges and potentials for the future development of these Au NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8211;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8211;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8211;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8211;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8211;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8211;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13 steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the importance of cation size in the tetragonal&#8208;cubic phase transition in lithium garnet electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium garnets are promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of 7 lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g. La3Zr2Li7O12), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8208;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub&#8208;lattice.

The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.

Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed via variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.</dc:description>

         <title>New palladium&#8208;ZrO2 nano&#8208;architectures from thermal transformation of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for carbonylative Suzuki and hydrogenation reactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160; new nanocomposites, Pd/C/ZrO2, PdO/ZrO2, and Pd/PdO/ZrO2, were prepared by thermal conversion of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2 (MOF) in nitrogen or air atmosphere. The presence of Pd nanoparticles, uniformly distributed on the ZrO2 or C/ZrO2 matrix, was evidenced by TEM (TEM = Transmission Electron Microscopy), SEM (SEM = Scanning Electron Microscopy), Raman and XPS (XPS = X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) methods. All pyrolysed composites retained the shape of the MOF template. They&#160; catalyze carbonylative Suzuki coupling under 1 atm CO with an efficiency significantly higher than the original&#160; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2. The most active PdO/ZrO2 composite, formed benzophenone with TOF up to 1600 h&#8208;1, while&#160; by using Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2, much lower TOF values, 51 &#8208; 95 h&#8208;1, were achieved.&#160; After the reaction, PdO/ZrO2 was recovered with the same composition and catalytic activity. Very good results were also obtained in the transfer hydrogenation of benzophenones to alcohols with Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions&#160; owing to &#160; limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse&#160;molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of&#160;  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (  1  ) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium&#160;  1  Tipp  ,&#160;  1  &#160;features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide&#160;  2  , the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide&#160;  4  &#160; and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide&#160;  6  &#160;t o be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8208;S&#8208;P five&#8208;membered ring (  7  ) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised&#160;Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P  7  (SiR  3  )  3  ) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  , was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state.

This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to Au  I  , thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither Pd  II  , Pt  II  , Zn  II  nor Hg  II  reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations Cu  I  and Ag  I  could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised

by single crystal X&#8208;ray di raction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H  2  O  2  , P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered

phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.</dc:description>

phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(  o  -TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
