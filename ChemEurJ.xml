         <title>Engineering Interfacial Molecular Interactions on Ag Hollow Fibre Gas Diffusion Electrodes for High Efficiency in CO2 Conversion to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silver hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) acts as a CO2 diffuser through the porous wall, effectively converting CO2 to CO in a wide potential range. CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) occurs at the nanoscale interface of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte. Therefore, tailoring the interfacial properties in the interface microenvironment provides a powerful strategy to optimise the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards the desired products. Here, the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface of the flow&#8208;through Ag&#8208;based hollow fibre gas diffusion electrode (Ag HFGDE) is modulated by introducing surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the electrolyte additive. The porous hollow fibre configuration and gas penetration mode facilitate the CO2 mass transfer and the formation of the triple&#8208;phase interface. Through the ordered arrangement of hydrophobic long&#8208;alkyl chains, CTAB molecules at the electrode/electrolyte interface promoted CO2 penetration to active sites and repelled water to reduce the activity of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By applying CTAB&#8208;containing catholyte, Ag HFGDE achieved a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 95&#8201;% in a wide potential range and double the partial current density of CO. The enhancement of CO selectivity and suppression of hydrogen was attributed to the improvement of charge transfer and the CO2/H2O ratio enhancement. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting the local microenvironment to enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction CO2RR.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Silica Film with a TGBA* Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally colored organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure are prepared using a thermochromic liquid crystal mixture. The structural color is sensitive to the polymerization temperature and the chiral additive concentration. A colorful OIHS pattern is prepared by the inject printing, which can be applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Twisted grain boundary (TGB) phases exhibit highly frustrated and complex liquid crystal structures, and have attracted enormous interest because of their unique internal structure, textures and properties. However, among the few real concerns related to these interesting structures, applying them to prepare polymer&#8208;stabilized colored liquid crystal films has been challenging. Herein, the organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure were prepared using two organosilanes and one chiral additive under an acidic condition. The structural color of the films can be adjusted by varying the polycondensation temperature and the concentration of the chiral additive. A structurally colored pattern was prepared by the inject printing, which was suitably applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzodihydrofurans Bearing Axial and Central Stereogenic Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of &#945; &#8208;chloronitrostyrenes and a chiral squaramide catalyst, C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N pro&#8208;axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthol substrates, featuring low barriers to enantiomerization, underwent a remote diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective domino Michael/O&#8208;alkylation. It provided the desired benzodihydrofurans bearing two stereogenic carbon atoms and a configurationally stable C&#8722;C or a C&#8722;N bond, thanks to a high increase of the barrier to rotation upon dihydrofurannulation.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral compounds containing multiple stereogenic elements via a single catalytic step is a challenging process.

         <title>Facile Preparation and Study of Self&#8208;Healing Water&#8208;Absorbing Expanding Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work to different environments of the three main means of self&#8208;heal in addition to the other two replication of the repair of the three cyclic alternation to cope with the alternation of different environments, the combination of fillers for the elastomer to provide water&#8208;absorbing expansion effect and electrical sensors to detect the function of the construction of a multi&#8208;environmental self&#8208;healing water&#8208;absorbing expansion of elastomers







Abstract
The absorbent expansion elastomer plays a crucial role in engineering sealing and holds a promising future in this field as infrastructure continues to develop. Traditional materials have their limitations, especially when used in large construction projects where the integrity and reliability of the material are of utmost importance. In this work, a self&#8208;healing water&#8208;absorbing expansion elastomer was developed for continuous production at a large scale to monitor the sealing conditions of massive infrastructure projects. At room temperature, the material exhibited a repairing efficiency of 57.77&#8201;% within 2&#8197;h, which increased to 84.02&#8201;% after 12&#8197;h. This extended reaction time allowed for effective repairs when defects were detected. The material's strength can attain 3&#8197;MPa, placing it at the upper echelon among common self&#8208;healing materials, thereby granting it a certain level of durability in its application environment. The material's volume expansion rate reached 200&#8211;400&#8201;% to achieve effective sealing, and the functional filling of the filler endowed the material itself with a favorable external force induction effect and prevented heat accumulation. The conductive detection performance of the absorbent expansion elastomer was improved by utilizing triple self&#8208;healing strategies, including dipole&#8208;dipole interaction, ion cross&#8208;linked network, and externally&#8208;aided restoration materials. These strategies were combined with a double packing strategy to enhance the material's properties. This innovative elastomer can be applied in various fields such as tunnel construction, infrastructure development, aerospace sealing, and railway transportation, showcasing significant potential for diverse engineering applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Positron&#8208;bonded Dihalides: Ps2XY (X, Y=F, Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic stability of Ps2XY complexes is confirmed through potential energy curves, and positron/electron densities reveal the presence of two&#8208;positron bonds. Ps2XY systems typically show shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies than the PsXY&#8722; ones. The analogy between Ps2XY systems and two&#8208;electron&#8208;bonded dialkali molecules AB, (A, B=Na, K, Rb) is also explored.







Abstract
This study explores the energetic stability and physical properties of 

Ps2XY

 ${{\rm{Ps}}_2 {\rm{XY}}}$



 complexes formed by two halide anions (X&#8722;, Y&#8722;=F&#8722;, X&#8722;, Br&#8722;), and two positrons (Ps: positron&#8208;electron pair). We combine electronic coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations with positronic multicomponent renormalized partial third&#8208;order propagator (MC&#8208;REN&#8208;PP3) calculations to effectively recover correlation energies. Analysis of potential energy curves confirms the energetic stability of these positronic molecules, with optimized structures identified as global minima. Further investigation of electron and positron densities reveals stabilization owing to the formation of two&#8208;positron bonds. The global stability of the 

Ps2XY

 ${{\rm{Ps}}_2 {\rm{XY}}}$



 complexes contrasts with the metastable two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded (PsH)2, which energetically favors the emission of Ps2. Comparative analysis of one&#8208; and two&#8208;positron dihalides indicates that the addition of a positron to PsXY&#8722; generally results in shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies, with exceptions due to differences in positron affinities of PsXY&#8722; and Y&#8722;. We explore the analogy between two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded dihalide systems 

Ps2XY

&lt;p&gt;The energetic stability of Ps&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;XY complexes is confirmed through potential energy curves, and positron/electron densities reveal the presence of two-positron bonds. Ps&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;XY systems typically show shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies than the PsXY&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ones.

 complexes formed by two halide anions (X&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Y&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, X&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), and two positrons (Ps: positron-electron pair). We combine electronic coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations with positronic multicomponent renormalized partial third-order propagator (MC-REN-PP3) calculations to effectively recover correlation energies. Analysis of potential energy curves confirms the energetic stability of these positronic molecules, with optimized structures identified as global minima. Further investigation of electron and positron densities reveals stabilization owing to the formation of two-positron bonds. The global stability of the

Comparative analysis of one- and two-positron dihalides indicates that the addition of a positron to PsXY&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generally results in shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies, with exceptions due to differences in positron affinities of PsXY&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Y&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Biocompatible Flash Chemiluminescent Assay Enabled by Sterically Hindered Spiro&#8208;Strained&#8208;Oxetanyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dioxetane</title>

Spiro&#8208;strain, steric hindrance, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects yield a chemically stable strained dioxetane with flash&#8208;type chemiluminescence. Probes composed of the tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl spiro&#8208;dioxetane show enhanced stability and sensitivity in bacterial and mammalian assays over cyclobutyl&#8208;fused probes.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence is the emission of light that occurs as a result of a chemical reaction. Depending on the rate of chemiexcitation, light emission can occur as a long&#8208;lasting, low&#8208;intensity, glow&#8208;type reaction or a rapid, highly intense flash&#8208;type reaction. Assays using a flash&#8208;type mode of action provide enhanced detection sensitivity compared to those using a glow&#8208;type mode. Recently, our group discovered that applying spiro&#8208;strain to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes significantly increases their chemiexcitation rate, thereby transforming glow&#8208;type chemiluminescence into flash&#8208;type chemiluminescence. However, further examination of the structure&#8208;activity relationships revealed that the spiro&#8208;strain severely compromises the chemical stability of the 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. We hypothesized that a combination of spiro&#8208;strain, steric hindrance, and an electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, will result in a chemically stable spiro&#8208;strained dioxetane with an accelerated chemiexcitation rate. Indeed, spiro&#8208;fused tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl exhibited a 128&#8208;fold faster chemiexcitation rate compared to adamantyl while maintaining similar chemical stability, with a half&#8208;life of over 400&#8197;hours in PBS 7.4 buffer at room temperature. Turn&#8208;on probes composed of tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl spiro&#8208;dioxetane exhibited significantly improved chemical stability in bacterial and mammalian cell media compared to previously developed dioxetane probes fused to a cyclobutyl unit. The superior chemical stability enables a tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl dioxetane probe to detect &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activity with enhanced sensitivity in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterial assays and leucine aminopeptidase activity in tumoral cell lines. Overall, the development of the tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl dioxetane luminophore enables us to enhance the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescent probes while maintaining high chemical stability. The results obtained in this study should assist in designing improved chemiluminescent probes and underscore the significance of strain&#8208;release techniques in enhancing the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescence assays.

         <title>The Divergent Reactivity of Acid Chlorides Under Transition Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid chlorides represent a highly reactive and versatile class of electrophiles widely used in synthesis as acylating agents. However, when combined with transition metal catalysis, new reactivity paradigms have been uncovered. This review examines the palladium, rhodium, and iridium&#8208;catalyzed transformations of acid chlorides with unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds and discusses future research directions.







Abstract
The power and ability of catalysis to build multiple C&#8722;C bonds in a single step has had a transformative impact on organic synthesis. While the reactivity of organohalides with metal catalysts is widely appreciated, the related and more intricate reactivity of acid chlorides is less so, despite their use as common reagents in synthesis. Here, we review the transformations of acid chlorides in combination with unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds catalyzed by palladium, rhodium, or iridium and provide an outlook for future research opportunities.

         <title>D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type [7]Helicene&#8208;like Imide Derivatives with Tunable Photophysical Properties and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type helical emitters are developed by integrating [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor (A) with five donors (D). These emitters show tunable emission colors from blue to orange and enhanced &#934;FL. Two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit significant CPL activities. This molecular engineering offers a viable strategy for enhancing the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives.







Abstract
Helicenes and their derivatives show great application prospects as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, but their fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FLs) need a breakthrough urgently. Herein, we reported a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type helical luminescent emitters by combining the [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor with five different donors. The obtained five emitters display blue&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence and markedly enhanced &#934;FL. Notably, TPA&#8208;NiBTI exhibits the maximum &#934;FL in solution, while TPE&#8208;NiBTI achieves a maximum &#934;FL in the solid state. Their two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit remarkable CPL activities, and their doped PS film both displayed doubled &#934;FLs. Among them, [(P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI]&#8208;doped PS film exhibits the maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) value of 9.0&#215;10&#8722;4 and the maximum &#934;FL of 22&#8201;%. This molecular design strategy presents a promising approach to improving the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives, thereby facilitating their potential application into chiral optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Halogen Impact on the Supramolecular Organization of Chiral Phthalimide Emitters Displaying Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogens can play a crucial role on room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of organic compounds, notably because of the well&#8208;known internal heavy atom effect. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond this commonly considered aspect, the presence of a halogen atom plays a critical role in influencing the packing between chromophores at the supramolecular level, which can significantly impact the resulting efficiency and lifetimes of the RTP process.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials has attracted an increasing attention in the recent years due to their potential application in various advancing technologies, notably in bioimaging and displays. In this context, heavy atoms such as halogen ones revealed useful tools to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of molecular organic phosphors. However, the effect of halogen at the supramolecular level remains less understood, especially in the field of molecular crystals where additional factors can impact the phosphorescence emission. Here, we investigate external effect of halogens on the phosphorescence of chiral phthalimides molecular crystals. The results show that changing the nature of the halogen atom onto the phthalimide core leads to an evolution of the photophysical properties of the materials which does not necessarily follow the classical trend imposed by the expected internal heavy atom effect. Beyond this aspect, we showed that the halogen atom has a profound impact on the packing between the chromophores at the supramolecular level which is of paramount importance towards the optical properties (PLQY and lifetimes) of the different phosphors examined.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room temperature phosphorescence from organic materials has attracted an increasing attention in the recent years due to their potential application in various advancing technologies, notably in bioimaging and displays. In this context, heavy atoms such as halogen ones revealed useful tools to enhance the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of molecular organic phosphors. However, the effect of halogen at the supramolecular level remains less understood, especially in the field of molecular crystals where additional factors can impact the phosphorescence emission. Here, we investigate external effect of halogens on the phosphorescence of chiral phthalimides molecular crystals. The results show that changing the nature of the halogen atom onto the phthalimide core leads to an evolution of the photophysical properties of the materials which does not necessarily follow the classical trend imposed by the expected internal heavy atom effect. Beyond this aspect, we showed that the halogen atom has a profound impact on the packing between the chromophores at the supramolecular level which is of paramount importance towards the optical properties (PLQY and lifetimes) of the different phosphors examined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of Large Perphenylbiaryls: Can Intermolecular Coupling Compete with Intramolecular Cyclization of Precursors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attempts to prepare perphenylbiaryls containing heptaphenylnaphthyl groups via Ullmann coupling or Diels&#8208;Alder reactions led predominantly to unusual intramolecular cyclization products derived from the naphthalene precursors. Ullmann coupling of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene gave only 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexaphenylfluoranthene, and Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 1&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene and tetracyclone gave the illustrated mixture of inter&#8208; and intramolecular cyclization products.







Abstract
The highly substituted naphthalenes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (13), 2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol (12), 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (4), and 1&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (5) were prepared by a variety of methods, and all but 5 were crystallographically characterized. The attempted Ullmann coupling of 4 to give tetradecaphenyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (3), at both 270&#8201;&#176;C and 350&#8201;&#176;C, yielded instead 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexaphenylfluoranthene (17) via an intramolecular cyclization reaction. When the alkyne 5 was heated with tetracyclone (6) at 350&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8208;(pentaphenylphenyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (7) was formed in 3&#8201;% yield. However, greater amounts of 5,6,7,8,9,14&#8208;hexaphenyldibenzo[a,e]pyrene (20, 11&#8201;%) and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenylfluoranthene (21, 11&#8201;%) were produced, the former by intramolecular cyclization and dehydrogenation of 5 and the latter by an intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 5 followed by extrusion of acetylene. The X&#8208;ray structure of 7 shows it to be an exceptionally crowded biaryl, and the X&#8208;ray structure of 20 shows it to be a saddle shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

         <title>Synergistic Nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8208;Co Heterojunctions for Boosting the Selectivity in Hydrogenation of Nitrostyrenes and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosed herein the graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8722;Co as highly efficient catalysts for low&#8208;pressure hydrogenation (&lt;5&#8197;bar), proficiently converting nitro groups to amines amid reactive functional groups like C=C, O&#8722;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. High selectivity and yield arise from the synergistic interaction between CoO and Mn3O4, facilitated by charge relocalization crucial for maintaining selectivity, a feature notably compromised in catalysts containing MnO, CoO, Co3O4, and other Co and Mn oxides.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;metal oxide interface catalysts are in high demand for advanced catalytic applications due to their multi&#8208;component active sites, which facilitate synergistic cooperation where a single component alone cannot effectively promote the desired reaction. Demonstrated herein graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8722;Co as highly efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of nitro styrenes/nitro arenes to amino styrenes/arenes under mild reaction conditions (0.5&#8197;MPa and 100&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 THF/water). Charge relocalization at the Co&#8208;CoO&#8208;Mn3O4 heterojunction interfaces, primarily driven by Mn3O4, significantly improves reaction selectivity. Replacing Mn3O4 with MnO or using other supported bimetallic CoMnOx catalysts decreases selectivity, leading to the formation of a mixture of products. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable selectivity in converting nitro groups to amines, even in the presence of highly reactive functional groups such as C=C, O&#8722;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. It also exhibited high yields, multiple reusability, and a broad substrate scope. This study demonstrates how Mn3O4, in synergy with CoO&#8722;Co, fine&#8208;tunes selectivity, paving the way for the development of advanced metal&#8208;metal oxide interface catalysts to enhance both selectivity and efficiency in organic transformations.

         <title>Supramolecular Spin Chains via Radical&#8208;Radical Contacts Stabilizing Ferromagnetic Interactions Between Heisenberg or Ising&#8208;Like Spins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular one&#8208;dimensional arrays of radical&#8208;metal coordination complexes (Ni &amp; Co) exhibit magnetic properties strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the spin carrier. Close contacts between regions of &#945; and &#946; spin density on the pendant paramagnetic ligands suggest a mechanism for the intra&#8208;chain ferromagnetic coupling via the McConnell I model.







Abstract
A new paramagnetic ligand, 4&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;furyl)&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;dithiadiazolyl (furylpymDTDA) and three transition metal coordination complexes, M(hfac)2(furylpymDTDA) M=Mn, Co, Ni; hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonato&#8722;), are reported. The solid&#8208;state structures are influenced by the geometry of the coordination sphere of the M(II) centers: trigonal (Mn) vs. octahedral (Co and Ni). While the hs&#8208;Mn(II) complex exhibits pairwise multi&#8208;centre&#8197;2&#8208;electron bonds (i.&#8201;e., pancake bonds) between the planar &#960; radical DTDA moieties, the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes crystallize with close contacts between coordinated furylpymDTDA radical ligands that define linear 1D arrays of molecular units. The magnetic data for the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes indicate ferromagnetic (FM) interactions between molecular units, apparently mediated by radical&#8208;radical contacts along the supramolecular chains. Computational analysis suggests proximity between regions of large &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;spin density on neighbouring molecular sites enabling FM exchange, in accordance with the McConnell I mechanism. The magnetic data for the Ni(II) complex are consistent with a Heisenberg spin chain, whereas the hs&#8208;Co(II) complex exhibits Ising&#8208;like spin chain behaviour and a magnetic phase transition to an FM ordered state at 4.6&#8197;K.

         <title>Exploring Chemical and Electrochemical Limitations in Sulfide Solid State Electrolytes: A Critical Review on Current Status and Manufacturing Scope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of solid electrolytes (SEs) as a promising alternative to liquid electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). It covers SE types, ion transport fundamentals, and manufacturing challenges of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Special focus is given to sulfide SEs, addressing recent advancements, electrochemical challenges, and future directions to enhance battery performance and safety.







Abstract
The escalating demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, driven by the depletion of fossil fuels has stimulated extensive research in advanced battery technologies. Over the past two decades, global primary energy consumption, initially satisfied by non&#8208;renewables, has raised environmental concerns. Despite the availability of renewable sources like solar and wind, storage challenges propel innovation in batteries. Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have gained recognition for their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, issues such as safety concerns, dendrite formation, and limited operational temperatures necessitate alternative solutions. A promising approach involves replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes (SEs). SEs represent a transformative shift in battery technology, offering stability, safety, and expanded temperature ranges. They effectively mitigate dendrite growth, enhancing battery reliability and lifespan.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, driven by the depletion of fossil fuels has stimulated extensive research in advanced battery technologies. Over the past two decades, global primary energy consumption, initially satisfied by non-renewables, has raised environmental concerns. Despite the availability of renewable sources like solar and wind, storage challenges propel innovation in batteries. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained recognition for their high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, issues such as safety concerns, dendrite formation, and limited operational temperatures necessitate alternative solutions. A promising approach involves replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with non-flammable solid electrolytes (SEs). SEs represent a transformative shift in battery technology, offering stability, safety, and expanded temperature ranges. They effectively mitigate dendrite growth, enhancing battery reliability and lifespan. SEs also improve energy density, making them crucial for applications like portable gadgets, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage. However, challenges such as ionic conductivity, chemical and thermal stability, mechanical strength, and manufacturability must be addressed. This review paper briefly identifies SE types, discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and explores ion transport fundamentals and all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) production challenges. It comprehensively analyzes sulfide SEs (SSEs), focusing on recent advancements, chemical and electrochemical challenges, and potential future improvements. Electrochemical reactions, electrolyte materials, compositions, and cell designs are critically assessed for their impact on battery performance. The review also addresses challenges in ASSB production. The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of SSEs, laying the groundwork for advancing sustainable and efficient energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Access to Terminal Nitroalkanes via Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydronitration and Hydronitroalkylation of Alkenes Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroalkanes: This work introduces methods to convert alkenes to terminal nitroalkanes using redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide and aromatic thiol as HAT mediator under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Mild conditions tolerate number of functionalities, and the products can be obtained with exceptional anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. In addition to hydronitration, we introduce an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitroalkylation strategy that facilitates chain expansion while maintaining the nitro group at the terminal position.







Abstract
The evolution of catalysis and functional group transfer reagents play a significant role in the development of anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, facilitating the access to value&#8208;added molecules. We herein report the first rational design of a modular intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitration of alkenes, enabling the direct synthesis of terminal nitroalkanes under visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. By employing the redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide, the produced nitryl radicals, in the presence of an olefin and a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediator, lead to an anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition with complete regioselectivity. Furthermore, we present results demonstrating the use of this catalytic system for chain expansion via anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition, utilizing substituted bromonitroalkanes as commercially available reagents. These transformations effectively address a gap in synthetic chemistry, enabling the direct synthesis of nitroalkanes from a variety of unactivated olefins in both complex molecules and unfunctionalized commodity chemicals.

         <title>A New Mechanism for Formation of Glycine from Glyoxylic Acid: the Aza&#8208;Cannizzaro Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyoxylate imine is found to undergo Cannizzaro&#8208;like disproportionation under mild conditions to form glycine. The mechanism by which an iminium&#8208;hemiaminal pair disproportionate into an amide and amine has not been previously reported.







Abstract
Glyoxylic acid and glycine are widely considered to have been important prebiotic building blocks. Several mechanistic routes have been previously examined for conversion of glyoxylic acid to glycine. Here we provide evidence for a new mechanistic path. Glycine is spontaneously formed from glyoxylic acid in ammonium&#8208;rich aqueous solutions at neutral pH; oxamic acid is generated as well. Hydride transfer from the glyoxylate&#8208;derived hemiaminal to the corresponding iminium ion appears to underlie this transformation. This proposed mechanism parallels the well&#8208;known Cannizzaro reaction mechanism, which leads us to suggest the designation &#8220;aza&#8208;Cannizzaro reaction.&#8221; This discovery offers a new perspective on prebiotic nitrogen incorporation because glycine can be a source of nitrogen for more complex molecules, including other &#945;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Resolving the Structure of a Guanine Quadruplex in TMPRSS2 Messenger RNA by Circular Dichroism and Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have determined the structure of a guanine quadruplex motif present in the messenger RNA of the TMPRSS2 protein. By using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and circular diuchroism spectroscopy we confirm a parallel arrangement involving a rigid tetrad core and flexible loops.







Abstract
The presence of a guanine quadruplex in the opening reading frame of the messenger RNA coding for the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) may pave the way to original anticancer and host&#8208;oriented antiviral strategy. Indeed, TMPRSS2 in addition to being overexpressed in different cancer types, is also related to the infection of respiratory viruses, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, by promoting the cellular and viral membrane fusion through its proteolytic activity. The design of selective ligands targeting TMPRSS2 messenger RNA requires a detailed knowledge, at atomic level, of its structure. Therefore, we have used an original experimental&#8208;computational protocol to predict the first resolved structure of the parallel guanine quadruplex secondary structure in the RNA of TMPRSS2, which shows a rigid core flanked by a flexible loop. This represents the first atomic scale structure of the guanine quadruplex structure present in TMPRSS2 messenger RNA.

         <title>Modelling and Numerical Evaluation of Photovoltaic Parameters of a Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cell Based on Methylammonium Tin Iodide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present cell architecture involves a thorough assessment of device physics including electric field distribution, effect of bandgap, effect of absorber thickness, generation and recombination, and band alignment. The model cell boasts a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 36&#8201;%, and has the ability to retain an impressive built&#8208;in potential of 0.58&#8197;eV at relatively high temperature (400&#8197;K).







Abstract
Designing a high&#8208;performance solar cell structure requires the understanding of material innovation, device engineering, charge behavior, operation characteristics and efficient photoconversion of light to generate electricity. This study offers a detailed numerical evaluation of the device physics in a highly efficient methylammonium&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (PSC) of the configuration, FTO/WO3/CH&#8323;NH&#8323;SnI&#8323;/GO/Fe. Utilizing the SCAPS&#8208;1D device simulator, an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.3184&#8197;V, short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 35.10&#8197;mA/cm2, Fill factor (FF) of 78.38&#8201;%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.24&#8201;% were achieved. The model cell exhibits a robust photon capture of 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency between 360 and 750&#8197;nm. The study also presents a temperature&#8208;dependent band alignment diagram which posted a built&#8208;in potential (Vbi) of 0.62&#8197;eV. The Vbi at 400&#8197;K was found to be 0.58&#8197;eV indicating that the model cell exhibits a decent temperature tolerance, and can retain approximately 93&#8201;% of its power at 400&#8197;K. Through Mott&#8208;Schottky capacitance analysis, deeper insights into the space&#8208;charge region are inferred, while recombination&#8208;generation investigations emphasize the significance of electronic properties in optimizing device performance. This paper, therefore, lays the foundation for future studies, offering clear pathways for device optimization and identifying key areas that require further investigation.

Herein, we exploit ligand geometry (linear vs. V&#8208;shaped) to tune the self&#8208;assembly pathways (one vs. two&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly), morphology (nanoparticles vs. fibers) and photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited state) of metallosupramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Understanding structure/property correlations in self&#8208;assembly is a key but challenging requirement for developing functional materials. Herein, we explore the importance of ligand geometry to fine&#8208;tune photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited states) and self&#8208;assembly pathways in metallosupramolecular polymerization. To this end, we have designed two hydrophobic Pt(II) complexes, 1 and 2, containing a &#960;&#8208;extended bidentate bipyridine ligand with different substitution pattern, resulting in different molecular geometries (linear vs. V&#8208;shaped). Detailed comparative studies revealed significant differences for both complexes in terms of their photophysical properties and self&#8208;assembly pathways in non&#8208;polar media. The V&#8208;shaped topology of 1 enables facile face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking with a certain curvature leading to luminescent spherical assemblies exhibiting MMLCT states and short Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt contacts via a single&#8208;step cooperative pathway. On the other hand, the higher preorganized linear topology of complex 2 induces a two&#8208;step competitive self&#8208;assembly process leading to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers with slipped packing and MLCT&#8208;originated emission. Our findings broaden the monomer scope for supramolecular polymerization and provide design guidelines for the realization of luminescent supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Functionalized Triphenylmethyl Radicals Showing High Stability and Reversible Electrochemical Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of radicals (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;) were synthesized and investigated with electrochemical measurements. The partially conjugated connection between the PBI and TTM&#8901; not only keeps inherent characteristics of building blocks but also facilitates electronic communication that causes distinct and reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes and contributes to obtain extremely high stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
This study presents a series of triphenylmethyl monoradicals incorporating varying numbers of peripheral perylene bisimide (PBI) substituents (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901; and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing PBI substituents significantly enhances the stability of these carbon radicals, enabling them to display exceptional electrochemical redox reversibility. Notably, the electronic interplay between the PBI substituents and the central triphenylmethyl core facilitates unique and reversible multi&#8208;step redox reactions. Among the reported radicals, the tris&#8208;PBI&#8208;functionalized radical (3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;) demonstrates the remarkable ability to accommodate up to seven electrons under negative potentials, forming high valence anions. This research promotes the development of highly stable carbon radicals with superior electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction processes, presenting promising avenues for the advancement of electric energy storage technologies.

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis of Luminescent Imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2 was synthesized from ammonothermal synthesis. The structure and presence of the imide groups could be determined in a multi&#8208;step characterization process using X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic methods. These investigations allowed to determine a preferred position of the hydrogen atoms among the possible imide positions. Doped samples show an efficient cyan luminescence under ultraviolet light.







Abstract
The structural variability of a compound class is an important criterion for the research into phosphor host lattices for phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). Especially, nitridophosphates and the related class of imidonitridophosphates are promising candidates. Recently, the ammonothermal approach has opened a systematic access to this substance class with larger sample quantities. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+. Its crystal structure is solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in space group Cc (no. 9) with lattice parameters a=12.5250(3), b=12.5566(4), c=7.3882(2) &#197; and &#946;=102.9793(10)&#176;. For the first time, adamantane&#8208;type (imido)nitridophosphate anions [P4N8(NH)2]8&#8722; are observed next to metal ions other than alkali metals in a compound. The presence of imide groups in the structure and the identification of preferred positions for the hydrogen atoms are performed using a combination of quantum chemical calculations, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Eu2+ doped samples exhibit cyan emission (&#955;max=498&#8197;nm, fwhm=50&#8197;nm/1981&#8197;cm&#8722;1) when excited with ultraviolet light with an impressive internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 41&#8201;%, which represents the first benchmark for imidonitridophosphates and is promising for potential industrial application of this compound class.

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels from Nanodiamonds and a Self&#8208;Assembling Tripeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomposite hydrogels can be obtained by embedding nanodiamonds (NDs) within the fibrillary network that arises from self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide biomolecule at physiological pH. Spectroscopy and microscopy data point to non&#8208;covalent interactions between peptide fibers and NDs, which enable modulation of the viscoelastic properties of the nanocomposites.







Abstract
We report the successful assembly of a tripeptide in the presence of nanodiamonds (NDs) into nanocomposite hydrogels. While the presence of NDs does not hinder peptide self&#8208;assembly and gelation kinetics are not affected, NDs improve the viscoelastic properties and significantly increase the elastic moduli of the peptide hydrogels. Increased resistance of the gels against applied stress can also be attained depending on the amount of NDs loaded in the nanocomposite. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy and TEM confirmed the presence of NDs on the surface, and not in the interior, of peptide nanofibers. Peptide&#8208;ND non&#8208;covalent interactions are also probed by Raman and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopies. Overall, this work enables the embedding of NDs into nanocomposite hydrogels formed through the self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide at physiological pH, and it provides key insights to open the way for their future applications in biomaterials, for instance exploiting their luminescence and near&#8208;infrared responsiveness.

         <title>The Many Facets of RuII(dppe)2 Acetylide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, we provide an overview of the use of RuII alkynyl derivatives toward the understanding and the development of various research domains, ranging from non&#8208;linear and linear optics to nano&#8208;and molecular electronics through molecular switches.







Abstract
In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the &#960; system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light&#8208;harvesting applications or non&#8208;linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/&#960; mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Detection of Guanine Quadruplexes by Raman Optical Activity and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Interpretation of the Spectra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dramatic increase of Raman optical activity of guanosine monophosphate reveals a quadruplex formation. The shapes of the spectra could be reproduced by computations and related to the geometry, in particular to the mutual twist of quadruplex units in the polymer.







Abstract
Quadruplexes formed by guanine derivatives or guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids are involved in metabolism and genetic storage of many living organisms, they are used in DNA nanotechnologies or as biosensors. Since many quadruplex geometries are possible the determination of their structures in aqueous solutions is difficult. Raman optical activity (ROA) can make it easier: For guanosine monophosphate (GMP), we observed a distinct change of the spectra upon its condensation and quadruplex formation. The vibrational bands become more numerous, stronger, and narrower. In particular, a huge ROA signal appears below 200&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The aggregation can be induced by high concentration, low temperature, or by a metal ion. We focused on well&#8208;defined quadruplexes stabilized by potassium, where using molecular dynamics and density functional theory the spectra and particular features related to GMP geometric parameters could be understood. The simulations explain the main experimental trends and confirm that the ROA spectroscopy is sensitive to fine structural details, including guanine base twist in the quadruplex helix.

         <title>N&#8208;doped Porous Carbon Derived from the Pyrolysis of a Polydopamine&#8208;coated Hypercross&#8208;linked Polymer for Enhanced CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of N&#8208;doped porous carbons (PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T) was prepared by coating polydopamine (PDA) on a hypercross&#8208;linked polymer (HCP) while adjusting the mass ratio and carbonisation temperature. The results showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 was 6.46&#8197;mmol/g and 3.05&#8197;mmol/g at 0&#8201;&#176;C, 25&#8201;&#176;C and 101&#8197;kPa, respectively.







Abstract
Porous carbon materials can simultaneously capture and convert carbon dioxide, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and using carbon dioxide as a feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals or fuel. In this work, a series of N&#8208;doped porous carbons (PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T) was prepared; the CO2 adsorption capacity of the prepared PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T was enhanced by coating polydopamine (PDA) on a hypercross&#8208;linked polymer (HCP) and then adjusting the mass ratio of PDA to HCP and the carbonization temperature. The results showed that the prepared PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 exhibited a high CO2 adsorption capacity due to abundant micropores (0.6762&#8197;cm3/g), a high specific surface area (1220.8&#8197;m2/g), and moderate surface nitrogen content (2.75&#8201;%). Notably, PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 6.46&#8197;mmol/g at 0&#8201;&#176;C and 101&#8197;kPa. Critically, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons can also be used as catalysts for the reaction of CO2 with epichlorohydrin to form chloropropylene carbonate, with chloropropylene carbonate yielding up to 64&#8201;% and selectivity of the reaction reaching 94&#8201;%. As a result, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons could serve as potential candidates for CO2 capture and conversion due to their high reactivity, excellent CO2 uptake, and good catalytic performance.

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10 eV [M(III) = Sc] and 3.65 eV [M(III) = Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3:2:9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskite based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (D&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4 kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy by Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes via Ultrasound&#8208;triggered CO release and ROS generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3 Br] Ph&#8208;tpy = 4'&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8226;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2 &lt; 1 &#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It&#160;focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes, exhibiting absorption in the NIR region (750&#8208;2500 nm), have been applied to various optical applications such as security marking, photovoltaic cells and chemotherapy of deep tissues in vivo. Electrochromic systems capable of switching NIR absorption are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. The development of organic&#8208;based materials is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility, however, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, several studies on organic electrochromic systems that allow ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption have been developed in recent years. In this review, we focus on redox&#8208;active well&#8208;defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states. We also address more sophisticated electrochromic systems that can modulate their properties in response to external stimuli such as light, heat, and electric potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#183;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#183;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3 and 3.00 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjusting the Number of Functional Groups in Vicinal Bis(trichlorosilylated) Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organo(chloro)silanes are indispensable building blocks in silicon chemistry. Yet, aside from the M&#252;ller&#8208;Rochow process for commodity chemicals, the synthesis of more sophisticated building blocks often takes considerable effort. We disclose efficient access routes to organo(chloro)silanes, &#8208;silyl ethers, and &#8208;siloxanes with vicinal Si centers, which are promising precursors for ditopic Lewis acids and hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic polymers.







Abstract
Organo(chloro)silanes are essential chemicals, but the synthesis of compounds of the formula RnSiCl4&#8722;n with defined values of n is usually laborious. Herein, we first disclose that a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available Cl3SiC&#8801;CSiCl3 and selected dienes provides facile access to vicinal bis(trichlorosilylated) benzenes and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes. Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8722;Cl bonds in 1,2&#8208;(Cl3Si)2C6H2Me2 (1) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H2pin) or catechol (H2cat), which act as Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging and/or Si&#8208;chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound 6, which contains a benzannulated eight&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;pin) ring with Si&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging pin moiety, furnishes 13 with a benzannulated five&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of 1 is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8722;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of 13 gives the rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;disila&#8208;2&#8208;oxaindane rac&#8208;15 with high selectivity.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;free Electrolysis Production of Hydrogen Peroxide on Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Dye Degradation</title>

         <dc:description>The efficient production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution was achieved by combining cathodic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208; ORR) and anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8208; WOR) in two half&#8208;reaction cells. h&#8208;BN loaded on carbon fibers (h&#8208;BN@C) is prepared and employed as an anode material to catalyze 2e&#8208; WOR, while sulfonated commercial BP&#8208;2000 carbons (BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H) were prepared as the cathode materials for 2e&#8208; ORR. In a 2 M KHCO3 solution, an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97% and a total H2O2 production rate of 1872 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 over metal&#8208;free electrodes were accomplished in a membrane&#8208;free flow cell. The dilute H2O2 solution could be directly used to degrade cationic Rhodamine B or methyl orange and anionic methylene blue dyes in water. This work proved low&#8208;cost production of dilute H2O2 solution in simple membrane&#8208;free flow cells with single electrolyte and on&#8208;site utilization for efficient dye degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Particle Size Template Method for Controllable Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Multilevel Porous Carbon as High&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion Hybrid Supercapacitor Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high rate performance without compromising energy density has always been a critical objective for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs). The pore structure and surface properties of carbon cathode materials play a crucial role. We propose utilizing a hybrid particle size (20 and 40 nm) magnesium oxide templates to regulate the pore structure of nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon derived from the soybean isolate. The multilevel pore structure enhanced ion transport efficiency while also improving the utilization of micropores. Nitrogen doping and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups enhanced the wettability of carbon materials with aqueous electrolytes and facilitated the chemisorption of Zn2+ on the carbon material surface. The nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon material (HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1) prepared with a 1:1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a specific capacity of 146.65 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1. Moreover, the Swagelok cells assembled with HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 and Zn foil achieved a high energy density of 121.5 W h kg&#8208;1, high power output of 166 W kg&#8208;1, and 93.09% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. Therefore, HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 is a highly promising candidate for ZHSCs cathode materials. Furthermore, the novel pore regulation strategy and straightforward preparation method offer valuable reference points for other porous carbon&#8208;based functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>MoSe2&#8208;Sensitized Water Splitting Assisted by C60&#8208;Dendrons on the Basal Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoirradiation of a water dispersion of MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) proceeded in the presence of a sacrificial donor (1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide) and co&#8208;catalyst (Pt&#8208;PVP). The apparent quantum yields of the HER were estimated to be 0.06&#8201;% and 0.27&#8201;% upon photoexcitation at the A&#8208; and B&#8208;exciton absorption peaks (&#955;max=800 and 700&#8197;nm), respectively.







Abstract
To facilitate water splitting using MoSe2 as a light absorber, we fabricated water&#8208;dispersible MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids via physical modification of the basal plane of MoSe2. Upon photoirradiation, the mixed&#8208;dimension MoSe2/C60 (2D/0D) heterojunction generates a charge&#8208;separated state (MoSe2&#8901;+/C60&#8901;&#8722;) through electron extraction from the exciton in MoSe2 to C60. This process is followed by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water in the presence of a sacrificial donor (1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide) and co&#8208;catalyst (Pt&#8208;PVP). The apparent quantum yields of the HER were estimated to be 0.06&#8201;% and 0.27&#8201;% upon photoexcitation at the A&#8208; and B&#8208;exciton absorption peaks (&#955;max=800 and 700&#8197;nm), respectively.

         <title>Insoluble Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Type Receptors Capture Iodine from the Vapor Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol walled acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors function as solid state sequestrants for iodine from the vapor phase with uptake capacities reaching 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 for H2. The uptake process involves both chemisorption (oxidation of H2; reduction of I2) and physisorption processes (uptake of I3&#8722; and I5&#8722;). H2 can be regenerated by treatment with aq. Na2S2O4 and reused five times.







Abstract
Nuclear energy makes large contributions toward meeting global energy needs, but societal concerns remain high given the impacts of the intended release of radioactive materials including 129I and 131I. In this paper we explore the use of a homologous series of acyclic CB[n] type hosts (H1&#8211;H4) as adsorbents of iodine from the vapor phase. We find that H2&#8211;H4, but not H1 &#8211; perform well in this application with uptake capacities of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 1.5&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, and 1.9&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. The chemisorptive uptake process involves partial oxidation of catechol walled H2 to quinone walled host and capture of I3&#8722; and I5&#8722;. Solid H2 can be regenerated by treatment with Na2S2O4 and reused at least five times. The x&#8208;ray crystal structure of H2 is also reported.

     alt="Insoluble Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril-Type Receptors Capture Iodine from the Vapor Phase"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catechol walled acyclic CB[n]-type receptors function as solid state sequestrants for iodine from the vapor phase with uptake capacities reaching 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt;. The uptake process involves both chemisorption (oxidation of &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt;; reduction of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and physisorption processes (uptake of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt; can be regenerated by treatment with aq. Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and reused five times.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy makes large contributions toward meeting global energy needs, but societal concerns remain high given the impacts of the intended release of radioactive materials including &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I and &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I. In this paper we explore the use of a homologous series of acyclic CB[n] type hosts (&lt;b&gt;H1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;H4&lt;/b&gt;) as adsorbents of iodine from the vapor phase. We find that &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;H4&lt;/b&gt;, but not &lt;b&gt;H1&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; perform well in this application with uptake capacities of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.5&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1.9&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The chemisorptive uptake process involves partial oxidation of catechol walled &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt; to quinone walled host and capture of I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Solid &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt; can be regenerated by treatment with Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and reused at least five times. The x-ray crystal structure of &lt;b&gt;H2&lt;/b&gt; is also reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of Active Centers in Predicting the Catalyst Turnover: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation catalysis has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable energy conversion. Among molecular catalysts, [Fe(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes have exhibited notable turning&#8208;over rates. Although various [M(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] complexes (M = Mn, Co, Ni) have been synthesized, however, the role of active centres has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we apply our newly developed catalytic models, efficiency conceptualization model (ECM) and the maximum kinetic efficiency MaxKinEff framework to assess the role of the active centres in its catalytic performance. Our computational analysis identifies cobalt&#8208;based [Co(OTf)2 (Me2Pytacn)] as a superior alternative for water oxidation reactions. Notably, cobalt catalysts exhibit a longer lifespan (~ 44 days) and higher turnover numbers (TON), with computed values of &#160;(ECM) = 3.30 h&#8208;1, &#160;(ECM) = 3456, (MaxKinEff) = 12.43 h&#8208;1, and &#160;(MaxKinEff) = 3616. These findings suggest that cobalt could play a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of molecular catalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorodefluorination Induced by Gallium&#8208;Based Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report on the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl gallium compounds by selective substitution of the &#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms in [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)]. First evidence for the catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] in chlorodefluorination reactions was obtained.







Abstract
The reaction of [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)] with chlorotrimethylsilane leads to the selective substitution of the &#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms and thus to the formation of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)]. The corresponding chlorogallate ion, [Ga(CCl2CF3)3Cl]&#8722;, could be isolated and structurally characterized as its tetraphenylphosphonium salt. The catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] was demonstrated via the chlorodefluorination of Me3SiCF3, 2,2&#8208;difluoropropane and [PPh4][Ga(C2F5)4].

         <title>Comparative Study of PtM (M=Cu, Zn, Ga, Mn, Fe, In, Ce) Bimetals on Zincosilicate for Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilising zincosilicate support and a straightforward ion&#8208;exchange method, this study obtains a range of non&#8208;precious M monometallic catalysts and PtM bimetallic catalysts (M=Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). With an enhanced propane dehydrogenation capability, the improved catalyst PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 can be operated in a pure propane atmosphere at 550&#8201;&#176;C for at least 168&#8197;hours without significant deactivation.







Abstract
Silicoaluminate zeolites have relatively strong Br&#246;nsted (B) acid properties that can easily lead to deep cracking reactions, making them less favourable as carriers for propane dehydrogenation. Here, we utilise zincosilicate zeolite with less B&#8208;acid produced by the introduction of the heteroatom Zn into the framework as a carrier, followed by simultaneous ion exchange (IE) of M monometallic or PtM bimetallic (M=Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). The optimized PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 exhibits a superior propane dehydrogenation performance over PtCu/Zn&#8208;4 and PtGa/Zn&#8208;4, which can achieve a propane conversion of about 30&#8201;% in a pure propane atmosphere at 550&#8201;&#176;C and can be operated for at least 168&#8197;h without significant deactivation. Characterization techniques such as spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy with different gas adsorptions are used to investigate these PtM@zeolite catalysts in order to deepen the understanding of acid site identification, promoter effect and catalysis.

We have introduced imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl], which exhibit strong DNA intercalation and protein binding, enhanced photophysical properties, increased 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character for PDT, high lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration, higher phototoxicity against TNBC cells in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions by generating reactive oxygen species and releasing CO under light exposure.







Abstract
We have introduced Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes (ReL1 &#8208; ReL6) [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl] where N^N=extensive &#960; conjugated imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives that helps in strong DNA intercalation, enhanced photophysical behavior, increase the 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character of T1 state for PDT and high value of lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration. These complexes exhibited prominent intraligand/ligand&#8208;centered (&#960;&#8208;&#960;*/1LC) absorption bands at &#955; 260&#8211;350&#8197;nm and relatively weak metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (1MLCT) bands within the &#955; 350&#8211;550&#8197;nm range. Among the six synthesized complexes, [(CO)3ReICl(K2&#8208;N,N&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline] (ReL6) exhibited outstanding potency (IC50~6&#8197;&#956;M, PI&gt;9) under yellow light irradiation compared to dark conditions. Importantly, extremely lipophilic complex ReL6 showed effective penetration through the cell membrane and localized primarily in mitochondria (Pearson's correlation coefficient, PCC=0.918) of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Complex ReL6 exhibited more than 9&#8197;times higher photo&#8208;toxicity in normoxic and hypoxic environment of tumor by inducing 1O2 generation (type&#8197;II PDT), radical generation triggered by NADH oxidation (type&#8197;I PDT). This complex is a promising candidate for TNBC treatment in hypoxic tumors, with efficacy comparable to photofrin and have demonstrated CO release ability under UV light irradiation.

Among the six synthesized complexes, [(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Re&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Cl(K&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-N,N-2-(4-(1-benzyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline] (&lt;b&gt;ReL6&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited outstanding potency (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;~6&#8197;&#956;M, PI&amp;gt;9) under yellow light irradiation compared to dark conditions. Importantly, extremely lipophilic complex &lt;b&gt;ReL6&lt;/b&gt; showed effective penetration through the cell membrane and localized primarily in mitochondria (Pearson's correlation coefficient, PCC=0.918) of MDA-MB-231 cells. Complex &lt;b&gt;ReL6&lt;/b&gt; exhibited more than 9&#8197;times higher photo-toxicity in normoxic and hypoxic environment of tumor by inducing &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation (type&#8197;II PDT), radical generation triggered by NADH oxidation (type&#8197;I PDT). This complex is a promising candidate for TNBC treatment in hypoxic tumors, with efficacy comparable to photofrin and have demonstrated CO release ability under UV light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Metal Complexes Using Dissolving Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General principles and recent advances in the electrochemical generation of metal complexes using dissolving anodes are discussed. The use of electrochemistry enables control of the metal oxidation state, reduces waste streams, and allows the incorporation of base&#8208;sensitive functionality in the products. The electrochemical method provides a means to rapidly produce large libraries of metal complexes for development of catalytic reactions.







Abstract
The use of dissolving metal electrodes for the direct electrochemical synthesis of metal complexes has been used widely in the last decade. A major benefit of the electrochemical approach is the minimal by&#8208;products resulting from the synthesis. As such, metal complexes can be produced on&#8208;demand and used directly in catalysis without the need for purification. Furthermore, the electrochemical method enables the production of metal complexes that cannot be synthesized using other methods, including those with base&#8208;sensitive ligands. General principles of the electrochemical method and recent advances in the field are discussed.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonization Synthesis of N, S Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Materials Derived from Agricultural Waste Peanut Shells for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No wasting of waste: N, S co&#8208;doped carbon material (NPSC&#8208;4) was prepared by using agricultural waste peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled using NPSC&#8208;4 not only has an energy density of 8.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, but also has good application value.







Abstract
Biomass carbon has the advantages of wide source, low cost and environmental protection, and has been widely used in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this work, N and S co&#8208;doped carbon materials were prepared by using peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. When the peanut shell and activator were 2&#8197;g and 4&#8197;g, respectively, the prepared NSPC&#8208;4 had the largest specific surface area and special pore structure. Elemental analysis showed that the activator introduced more N, S and O atoms to the carbon material, and more heteroatoms helped to improve the surface structure of the carbon material and provide additional pseudocapacitance. In addition, NSPC&#8208;4 contains a short&#8208;range ordered graphite structure, which can provide excellent electrical conductivity. The electrochemical test results show that NSPC&#8208;4 has the largest specific capacitance. When the mass of the activator is higher than or below 4&#8197;g, the electrochemical performance of the carbon material will be reduced. The symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) assembled by NSPC&#8208;4 has an energy density of 8.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 when the power density is 350&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The synthesis method is not only simple, green and economical, but also has important application value.

         <title>Toward Molecular Textiles: Synthesis and Characterization of Molecular Patches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of exploring and establishing a new fabrication method towards molecular textiles, molecular patches, which are smaller structural analogues, are investigated. The working principle of molecular patch formation, relies on a bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped covalent templated monomer, that via in&#8208;solution synthesis forms macrocyclic oligomers, which upon template cleavage result into linear fragments.







Abstract
This works describes a new step into the assembly of molecular textiles by the use of covalent templating. To establish a well&#8208;founded base and to tackle pre&#8208;mature obstacles, expected during the fabrication of the desired 2D&#8208;material, we opted to investigate the in&#8208;solution synthesis of molecular patches e.&#8201;g. cut&#8208;outs of a textile. A bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped monomer was designed, synthesized and was in&#8208;detail characterized by means of 1H&#8208;NMR and chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopy. In addition, x&#8208;ray structure crystallography was used to assess the absolute configuration. The monomer was used in an in&#8208;solution oligomerization to assemble the molecular patches via imine condensation, which revealed the formation of predominately dimeric patches. The imine&#8208;oligomer mixtures were further analyzed by reduction and cleaved to investigate the conditions required post mono&#8208;layer assembly. All reaction stages were followed by FT&#8208;IR and 1H&#8208;NMR analysis. Finally, we address the adsorption of the cross&#8208;shaped monomer onto a Au(111) surface, via high vacuum electrospray deposition. The subsequent annealing of the interface induced the on&#8208;surface imine condensation reaction, leading to unidimensional oligomers co&#8208;adsorbed with clusters of cyclic&#8208;dimers. Nc&#8208;AFM analysis revealed the tridimensional molecular structures, and together with electrospray deposition technique showed to be a promising pathway to investigate potential monomer candidates.

         <title>Multilevel Dynamic System as Molecular Morning&#8208;After Timer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalistic bilayer dynamic library was prepared using disulfide/dithioacetal/thiol exchanges, and its final steady composition was used to obtain information about the timing, duration, and intensity of a past, apparently traceless event that transitorily altered the molecular network wiring.







Abstract
Systems chemistry aims to develop molecular systems that display emerging properties arising from their network and absent in their individual constituents. Employing reversible chemistry under thermodynamic control represents a valuable tool for generating dynamic combinatorial libraries of interconverting molecules, which may exhibit intriguing collective behaviour. A simple dynamic combinatorial library was prepared using dithioacetal/thiol/disulfide exchanges. Because of the relative reactivities of these reversible reactions, the library constitutes a two&#8208;layer dynamic system with one layer active in an acid medium (thiol/dithioacetal exchange) and one layer active in a basic medium (thiol/disulfide exchange). This property enables the system to respond to momentary changes in acidity of the medium by activating different network regions, channeling some building blocks from one layer to another through shared thiol reagents (nodes). This momentaneous change in wiring affects the final steady state composition of the library, measured the next day, even though the event that caused it vanishes without leaving any residue. Therefore, the final composition of this dynamic system provides information about this transient past perturbation in the environment such as: when it occurred, how long it was, or how intense it was.

         <title>Tuning the Stability and Kinetics of Dioxazaborocanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron adducts with reversible bonding that dissociate slowly and completely are difficult to achieve. A new kind of dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) is reported that features dissociation kinetics in the day&#8208;to&#8208;week range. Furthermore, we investigated by substitution on various positions how the equilibrium reaction between DOAB, phenylboronic acids (BA) and diethanolamines (DEA) in water can be adjusted.







Abstract
We investigated the equilibrium reaction of boronic acid (BA), diethanolamines (DEA), and 1,3,6,2&#8208;dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) in aqueous solutions, both theoretically and experimentally. Our findings show that the association constant can be adjusted by substituting BA and DEA derivatives, ranging from 100 to 103&#8197;M&#8722;1, exhibiting a bell&#8208;shaped pH dependency. The highest stability was achieved when the pKa values of DEA and BA were closely matched. This approach enabled the preparation of a highly stable DOAB under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis kinetics of DOABs were controllable over a range of five orders of magnitude based on the substituent's steric effect. In the slowest case, this resulted in quasi&#8208;static stability with only 1&#8201;% cleavage in the first hour, followed by a week&#8208;long cleavage period to reach equilibrium. These insights could establish a unique chemistry platform for designing scheduled cleavability on a day&#8208;to&#8208;week timescale, relevant to protein engineering, immunotherapy, and other smart drug delivery applications.

     alt="Tuning the Stability and Kinetics of Dioxazaborocanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boron adducts with reversible bonding that dissociate slowly and completely are difficult to achieve. A new kind of dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) is reported that features dissociation kinetics in the day-to-week range. Furthermore, we investigated by substitution on various positions how the equilibrium reaction between DOAB, phenylboronic acids (BA) and diethanolamines (DEA) in water can be adjusted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the equilibrium reaction of boronic acid (BA), diethanolamines (DEA), and 1,3,6,2-dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) in aqueous solutions, both theoretically and experimentally. Our findings show that the association constant can be adjusted by substituting BA and DEA derivatives, ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, exhibiting a bell-shaped pH dependency. The highest stability was achieved when the p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of DEA and BA were closely matched. This approach enabled the preparation of a highly stable DOAB under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis kinetics of DOABs were controllable over a range of five orders of magnitude based on the substituent's steric effect. In the slowest case, this resulted in quasi-static stability with only 1&#8201;% cleavage in the first hour, followed by a week-long cleavage period to reach equilibrium. These insights could establish a unique chemistry platform for designing scheduled cleavability on a day-to-week timescale, relevant to protein engineering, immunotherapy, and other smart drug delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Reduction of Nitroarenes with Formate Salts as Reductants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using the formate salt as the reductant is developed. A range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into value&#8208;added anilines under blue light irradiation. Mechanistic studies revealed that arene thiol radicals and CO2&#8901;&#8722; are key intermediates for the transformation. The protocol represents a transition metal free and green example for the realization of such transformations.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using formate salts as the reductant was developed. A wide range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into aniline products in a transition metal free fashion. Mechanistic studies revealed that radical species (carbon dioxide radical anion and thiol radical) are key intermediates for the transformation. We anticipate that this method will provide a valuable and green strategy for the reduction of nitrobenzenes.

         <title>Nanoenabled Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Organic Algaecides Generated Photosynthetic Inhibition and Oxidative Stress for Sustainable Food Security</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoalgaecide was prepared by the self&#8208;assembled natural polyphenols and two functional metal ions for the application of effective algal inhibition in plant factory to promote food sustainability. This innovative approach achieves a synergistic combination of shading effects and cell&#8208;targeted delivery of copper ions derived from the phenolic&#8208;mediated cell interfacial interaction.







Abstract
Achieving food sustainability is one of the biggest challenges in the new millennium. Plant factory cultivation systems provide an alternative for food sustainability, while they often suffer from algal blooms. The overuse of conventional algaecides has caused significant environmental pollution and concerns about food security. Here, we design a nanoenabled metal&#8208;organic algaecide that is self&#8208;assembled from natural polyphenols and two functional metal ions for providing shading effects and delivering active ingredients synergistically to suppress algal blooms. Black wattle tannin (BWT) and Fe3+ ions are utilized to develop self&#8208;assembled FeBWT nanoalgaecides with significant shading effects for decreasing light transmission (up to 97&#8201;%) and effectively inhibiting algal photosynthesis. Further, the FeBWT is functionalized with Cu2+ ions (bimetallic Cu/FeBWT) to target the algal cells and release Cu2+ ions via phenolic&#8208;mediated cell surface interactions, thus enhancing the inhibition efficiency. Importantly, the biosafety of Cu/FeBWT is demonstrated through toxicity tests on zebrafish and NIH3T3 cells. In our real&#8208;world field test, the Cu/FeBWT demonstrates high algal inhibition performance (&gt;95&#8201;%, over 30&#8197;days), and enhances the accumulation of food nutrients in model plant lettuces. Collectively, the supramolecular metal&#8208;organic nanoalgaecide provides a promise for nanoagrochemical application and promotes food sustainability and security.

         <title>In Situ Built ZnS/MXene Heterostructure by a Mild Method for Inhibiting Polysulfide Shuttle in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnS nanospheres were uniformly in&#8208;situ grown on MXene nanosheets using a mild method. Compared with the critically self&#8208;stacked MXene, the well&#8208;dispersed MXene nanosheets in ZnS/MXene heterostructures provide rich active sites and rapid Li+ transfer channels. The interfacial built&#8208;in electric field further promotes electron/ion migration, thus accelerating polysulfide conversion and alleviating the shuttle effect.







Abstract
With high specific surface area, excellent polysulfide conversion activity, and fast electron/ion transfer at the interface, MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures can be employed as catalysts for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries to accelerate sulfur redox kinetics and suppress shuttle effect. However, the preparation of MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures often requires high&#8208;temperature reactions, which can easily lead to the oxidation of MXene and sacrifice the electrical conductivity. Herein, a catalytic two&#8208;dimensional heterostructure (ZnS/MXene) was successfully synthesized via a mild method. The MXene skeleton retains the original nanosheet structure without oxidation. The in&#8197;situ&#8208;grown ZnS nanospheres prevent the restacking of MXene nanosheets, which not only increases the active sites, but also guarantees channels for the fast passage of lithium ions. The interfacial built&#8208;in electric field further promotes electron/ion migration, thereby expediting the polysulfide conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the batteries using ZnS/MXene modified separators exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1230&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and a low decaying rate of 0.082&#8201;% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work offers a reference for the fabrication of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex&#8208;Assisted Photochemical Conversion of O&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Protected Hydroxamates to Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photochemical protocol for the conversion of O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl hydroxamates to primary or secondary amides was developed. The N&#8722;O bond cleavage was achieved under LED irradiation at 370&#8197;nm in the presence of an amine, suggesting the generation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex, as confirmed by supplementary DFT and UV&#8208;Vis studies.







Abstract
The hydroxamic acid functionality is present in various medicinal agents and has attracted special interest for synthetic transformations in both organic and medicinal chemistry. The N&#8722;O bond cleavage of hydroxamic acid derivatives provides an interesting transformation for the generation of various products. We demonstrate, herein, that O&#8208;benzyl&#8208;type protected hydroxamic acids may undergo photochemical N&#8722;O bond cleavage, in the presence or absence of a catalyst, leading to amides. Although some O&#8208;benzyl protected aromatic hydroxamates may be photochemically converted to amides in the presence of a base and anthracene as the catalyst, employing O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group allowed the smooth conversion of both aliphatic and aromatic hydroxamates to primary or secondary amides in good to excellent yields in the presence of an amine, bypassing the need of a catalyst. DFT and UV&#8208;Vis studies supported the effective generation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex between O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl hydroxamates and amines, which enabled the successful product formation under these photochemical conditions. An extensive substrate scope was demonstrated, showcasing that both aliphatic and aromatic hydroxamates are compatible with this protocol, affording a wide variety of primary and secondary amides.

         <title>Spirocyclopropanes and Substituted Furans by Controlling Reactivity of 1,3&#8208;Enynoates: &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;Addition of Phosphines to Conjugate Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the organophosphine chemistry, the typical reaction is initiated through the &#946;&#8208;addition of phosphine to allenoates or alkynoates. This paper reports an unprecedented reactivity of 1,3&#8208;enynoates and indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in the presence of phosphines. When indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione was used, &#947;&#8208;addition of phosphines to 1,3&#8208;enynoates was observed; this process resulted in the formation of spirocyclopropanes. However, when 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione was used, furans were produced through the &#948;&#8208;addition pathway.







Abstract
In the Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) reaction, a nucleophile undergoes &#946;&#8208;addition to activated alkenes or alkynes, forming reactive intermediates for subsequent carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;hetero bond formation. By using a &#960;&#8208;conjugated acceptor, however, an unprecedented reactivity of 1,3&#8208;enynoates and indane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones was uncovered in the presence of phosphines. When indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were used, &#947;&#8208;addition of phosphines to 1,3&#8208;enynoates was observed for the first time; moderate to good yields were obtained for 14 substances containing the prominent spirocyclopropane scaffold with 100&#8201;% retention of (Z)&#8208;alkene. When 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indan&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones were used, di(tri)&#8208;substituted furans were produced through the &#948;&#8208;addition pathway, with 20 substances and a yield of up to 88&#8201;% being achieved. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were conducted to obtain insights into the unconventional &#947;&#8208;addition reaction pathway.

         <title>Synthesis and Spectroscopic Study of a Homogenous Bimetallic Os(II) Complex as a New Gastric Cancer Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis and characterization of a homogenous dinuclear Os(II) polypyridyl complex. The Os(II) complex exhibited a panchromatic UV&#8208;vis absorption, and can strongly generate 1O2 under LED light irradiation. It can also interact with fatty acids; and exhibited potent photocytotoxicity against HGC&#8208;27 human gastric cancer cells under irradiation, while was non&#8208;cytotoxic in the dark.







Abstract
A homogenous dinuclear Os(II) complex bisOs was synthesized and fully characterized. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry study, and density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the electronic property. bisOs showed an obvious interaction with lipase and BSA, and can generate singlet oxygen under blue and red LED light irradiation, with a singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) of 0.36 in comparison to that of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 in acetonitrile. bisOs exhibited moderate to great photocytotoxicity against HGC&#8208;27 human gastric cancer cells under blue LED light irradiation, giving the IC50 value as low as 1.83&#8197;&#956;M (PI value is 9.7), while was almost non&#8208;cytotoxic in the dark. The cellular singlet oxygen detection in HGC&#8208;27 cancer cells exhibited a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and cell uptake of bisOs in A549 cells was as high as 120&#8197;ng/106 cells, subcellular colocalization study indicated that bisOs was not accumulated in nucleus, and less likely to target mitochondria. This work provides a new example of dinuclear osmium complex as potential photosensitizer candidate for gastric treatment.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetramethoxy substituted alkyl&#8208;acridiniums are readily available by facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution on tris(dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium, but are non&#8208;fluorescent, presumably due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer quenching. In this work we introduce electron withdrawing groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, leading to fluorescence turn&#8208;on. The acridiniums are moderately fluorescent (&#981;f = 20%) with long fluorescene lifetimes (&#964;f = 9 ns). The positive excited state reduction potentials (E*red = +1.6 V) make the TMAcr+ excellent electron acceptors in the excited state, and efficient reductive photoredox catalysts able to oxidize a broad range of substrates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A cascade phosphorylation cycloisomerization of readily accessible ynones and diphenylphosphine oxides facilitated by potassium phosphate is described, allowing for the straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline scaffolds. The formation of a C&#8722;P bond and a C&#8722;N bond is achieved in a single procedure without the need for pre&#8208;assembled quinoline cores prior to phosphorylation. This transformation operates without the requirement for metals or oxidants and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity evaluation demonstrated that the synthesized C4 phosphorylated quinoline derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Situ Application of H2O2 Produced via Catalytic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ utilization of catalytically synthesized H2O2 in the field of organic synthesis such as amidoximation of ketones, alcohols oxidation, C&#8722;H oxidation, olefin epoxidation.







Abstract
Industrial production of H2O2 requires lots of energy and causes environmental pollution. Moreover, in subsequent applications, much economic loss could be produced during the transportation process of H2O2 and its dilution process. Therefore, it is highly desirable for in&#8197;situ application of H2O2. In recent years, catalytic synthesis of H2O2, e.&#8201;g., direct catalytic synthesis, electrocatalytic synthesis, and photocatalytic synthesis, has attracted more and more attention because the continuous and low&#8208;concentration H2O2 produced by catalytic synthesis can be directly used for the oxidation of organic compounds, effectively avoiding the shortcomings of the current industrial route. Here, we briefly reviewed the latest processes for the catalytic production of H2O2 via various routes. On this basis, we summarized and discussed the in&#8197;situ application of H2O2 in typical organic conversion reactions, including the ammoximation of ketones, the oxidation of alcohols, the oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds, and the oxidation of olefins. Some in&#8197;situ coupling reactions have shown excellent performance with high conversion and selectivity, and the economic cost has been significantly reduced. Finally, the shortcomings of the in&#8197;situ utilization of H2O2 in coupling reactions were analyzed, and some strategies for promoting the efficiency of the H2O2 application in organic synthesis were proposed.

Finally, the shortcomings of the in&#8197;situ utilization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in coupling reactions were analyzed, and some strategies for promoting the efficiency of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; application in organic synthesis were proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D COF membranes, with interconnected channels and tunable structures, offer promising methods for efficient separation. This review details their design principles, preparation methods, and applications in separation field, concluding with current challenges and provides an outlook for the future.







Abstract
Membrane separation has become an indispensable separation technology in social production, playing an important role in drug production, mineral exploitation, water purification, etc. The key core of membranes lies in achieving efficient and precise sieving between substances. As a result, a typical trade&#8208;off arises: highly permeable membranes usually sacrifice selectivity and vice versa. To address this dilemma, long&#8208;term research has focused on comprehensive understanding and modelling of synthetic membranes at various scales. A significant advancement in this arena is the advent of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes, a novel category of long&#8208;range ordered porous organic polymer materials. Characterized by an abundance of interconnected channels, diverse pore wall properties, tunable structures, and robust thermal and chemical resilience, 3D COF membranes offer a promising approach for efficient substance separation. This review undertakes a meticulous investigation of the synthesis and physicochemical properties of 3D COF membranes, accentuating the underlying design principles, fabrication methods, and application attempts. A comprehensive assessment of their research trajectory and current standing in the field of membrane processes is provided. The review culminates in a forward&#8208;looking outlook, summarizing future research directions and highlighting the substantial potential of this innovative work to shape the future of efficient membrane separation processes.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, practical, and sustainable isomerization&#8208;suppressed peptide bond formation via acyl sulfonamide, a twisted amide, was developed. All reagents used in this study are inexpensive and readily available, and thus the developed method can immediately become a truly practical method to solve the synthetic problems of complex molecules such as medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides and hybrid peptide&#8208;polyketides.







Abstract
A robust, practical, and sustainable isomerization&#8208;suppressed peptide bond formation via acyl sulfonamide, a twisted amide, is disclosed. Tosyl isocyanate and pentafluorobenzyl bromide were applied in combination to activate the peptide C&#8208;terminus, which then reacted with an amine to yield an elongated peptide with high stereochemical purity. Careful analysis of NMR spectra of the active intermediate revealed the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond, suggesting that the hydrogen bond suppressed C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during amidation. The isomerization suppression by the intramolecular hydrogen bond is expected to be effective even under high dilution conditions, making the present method a powerful tool for the synthesis of complex macrocyclic peptides. In addition to peptide synthesis, the developed synthetic entry to twisted amides can be applied to the investigation of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;C bond activation. Moreover, the application to the N&#8722;C bond activation returned insight into peptide synthesis, leading to the use of sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid that can be orthogonally removed in the presence of other conventional protecting groups.

         <title>Controlled Photooxidation via Singlet Oxygen Generation by Triplet Harvesting in a Heavy Atom Free Pure Organic Dithienylethene&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide</title>

The content demonstrated efficient control over singlet oxygen generation using a switchable photosensitizer, where the open isomeric form of compound 7 indicated &#8220;on&#8208;state&#8221; and the closed isomeric form of compound 7 effectively switch &#8220;off&#8221; the singlet oxygen generation process.







Abstract
Noninvasive control over the reversible generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) has found the enormous practical implications in the field of biomedical science. However, metal&#8208;free pure organic emitters, connected with a photoswitch, capable of generating &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; 1O2 via triplet harvesting remain exceedingly rare; therefore, the utilization of these organic materials for the reversible control of singlet oxygen production remains at its infancy. Herein, an ambient triplet mediated emission in quinoline&#8208;dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivative is unveiled via delayed fluorescence. The quinoline&#8208;DTE&#8208;cNDI triad displayed enhanced photoswitching efficiency via double FRET mechanism. It was found to have direct utilization in controlled photosensitized organic transformations via efficient generation of singlet oxygen (yield &#934;&#916;~0.55 in DCM and 0.73 in methanol). The designed molecule exhibits a long&#8208;lived emission (&#964;&#8764;1.1&#8197;&#956;s) and very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) of 0.13&#8197;eV empowering it to display delayed fluorescence. Comprehensive steady state and time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analyses along with DFT calculations offer detailed understandings into the excited&#8208;state manifolds of organic compound and energy transfer (ET) pathways involved in 1O2 generation.

The synthesis and photophysical analysis of asymmetric boron chromophores, BOPAM, reveal solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and ICT pathways, highlighting their potential in pH&#8208;sensing applications, as demonstrated through systematic experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
A novel category of asymmetric boron chromophores with the attachment of two BF2 moieties denoted as BOPAM has been successfully synthesized via a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step reaction starting from N&#8208;phenylbenzothioamide. This synthetic route results in the production of [a] and [b]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs along with post&#8208;functionalization of the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been systematically investigated through steady&#8208;state absorption and fluorescence emission measurements in solvents at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures, as well as in the solid state. Computational methods have been employed to elucidate the emissive characteristics of the benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs, revealing distinctive photophysical attributes, including solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity. Remarkably, certain BOPAM derivatives exhibit noteworthy photophysical phenomena, such as the induction of off&#8208;on fluorescence emission under specific solvent conditions and the manifestation of intermolecular charge transfer states in solid&#8208;state matrices. Through post&#8208;functionalization strategies involving the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups onto the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM scaffold, an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) pathway is activated, leading to substantial fluorescence quenching via non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Notably, one [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM variant exhibits a pronounced fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to acidic conditions, thereby underscoring its potential utility in pH&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Enzymatic Detection of Cardiac Troponin&#8208;I with Graphene Oxide Quenched Fluorescent Iron Nanoclusters (FeNCs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence of BSA@FeNCs was quenched with GO&#8208;based probes to detect cTnI. The fluorescent probe shows a switch on toward cTnI in a human serum sample with a good recovery percentage.







Abstract
Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the most resorted biomarker for the detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The means of rapid quantification of cTnI levels in the blood can substantially minimize the risk of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. A sensor for the non&#8208;enzymatic evaluation of cardiac troponin&#8208;I has been developed using fluorescent iron nanoclusters via a one&#8208;pot synthesis employing (BSA) as the template and reducing agent, and hydrogen peroxide as the additive. The fluorescence of Iron Nanocluster is quenched with graphene oxide (GO) via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between conjugate iron nanoclusters and graphene oxide. The sensor shows a low detection limit of 0.011&#8197;ng/mL. The benefits of utilizing a non&#8208;enzymatic probe for detecting cardiac troponin I is that it avoids the need for enzymes and hence is economical, stable, and less impacted by environmental conditions such as temperature and pH. Non&#8208;enzymatic probes are more useful for clinical use since they are more stable and have a longer shelf life. The developed non&#8208;enzymatic probes are also highly selective and sensitive to the target analyte, making them suitable for the direct detection of cardiac troponin I in actual biological samples.

         <title>Cellular Phosphate Sensing and Anion Binding by an Azacrown&#8208;Calixpyrrole Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half azacrown and half calixpyrrole hybrid binds and senses orthophosphate with high selectivity over other phosphates released by lysozyme&#8208;mediated lysis from living cells. The behavior of this unique receptor&#8208;sensor is explained by NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD), and ab initio MD calculations.







Abstract
A hybrid receptor&#8208;sensor for anions originating from the merging of positively charged ammonium moieties for electrostatic attraction/stronger binding of azacrowns with directionality of calixpyrrole hydrogen bond donors for selectivity is investigated. As demonstrated this hybrid receptor&#8208;sensor shows a remarkable selectivity for orthophosphate even in the presence of other phosphates and anions found in cellular materials (Kassoc H2PO4&#8722;&gt;H2P2O72&#8722;&gt;AMP&#8722;&#8811;ADP2&#8722; or ATP3&#8722; over halides, nitrate, or hydrogen sulfate; all Na+ salts in water) but also cellular polyphosphate or phospholipids. This selectivity is harnessed in a real&#8208;time monitoring of cell lysis by lysozyme, which releases orthophosphate and other phosphates and anions from the cells. This sensitive (LOD 0.4&#8197;&#956;M) fluorescence&#8208;based microscale method compares favorably with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques but can easily be practiced in a high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) manner. The anion binding and selectivity in aqueous solutions were investigated by NMR and put in context with phosphate binding of the parent calix[4]pyrrole. The microscopic understanding of anion binding by the hybrid receptor was then obtained from a combination of density functional theory (DFT), classical molecular dynamics (MD) with explicit water solvation, and ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. Correlating the NMR and fluorescence binding data with studies of solvation of the receptor, phosphate anion, and the resulting complex confirms the binding is largely driven by entropic component (T&#916;S) associated with receptor and anion desolvation.

         <title>Fast and Efficient Sensing of Drugs in Water Using Self&#8208;Assembling D&#8208;Glucamine&#8208;Functionalized Naphthalenediimide and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed two self&#8208;assembling fluorophores functionalized with D&#8208;Glucamine, as fluorescent sensors for emerging pollutants in water, such as drugs, belonging to different classes and differing significantly in structure.







Abstract
Fast and sensitive quantification of drugs as emerging pollutants in water bodies is a pressing need in contemporary society, to prevent serious environmental concerns that could negatively impact on human health. This explains the surge of interest in this field, and the need to identify highly selective sensing systems. Addressing this issue, in this work we synthesized two D&#8208;glucamine functionalized fluorophores bearing self&#8208;assembling cores, as 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and naphthalene diimide. We studied their self&#8208;assembly in water solution, and characterized the aggregated formed by determining their stability constant, their morphology and size by scanning electron microscopy, resonance light scattering and dynamic light scattering, as well their solid&#8208;state emission ability. Then, we studied their sensing ability, in water, towards pharmaceutically active compounds such as ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac sodium salt, by fluorescence investigation. Data collected show that the self&#8208;assembling ability is significantly affected by the fluorophore structure, which in turn also determines sensing ability. In particular, the naphtalene diimide&#8208;based probe was the most sensitive, with LOD as low as 0.01&#8197;&#956;M in the presence of nalidixic acid, which is in line and competitive with more complex sensing systems, recently reported in the literature.

         <title>Synthesis of Adhesive Polyrotaxanes Through Sequential Self&#8208;Assembly via Supramolecular Interactions and Dynamic Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the previous covalent reactions&#8208;involved synthesis, this work presented a new approach for synthesis of PRs entirely by sequential self&#8208;assembly via supramolecular interactions and dynamic covalent Interactions. Monomers could first self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular polymers, and then self&#8208;assemble to form polyrotaxanes through dynamic covalent bonds.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly is an effective approach to construct complicated structures. Polyrotaxanes (PRs) as one of the typical polymer types with complex structure, own interlocked structures and dynamic components, in which it results in unique characteristics and functions. Currently, the synthesis of which involves covalent reactions to hinder the development of polyrotaxanes. Herein, we employed supramolecular interactions as well as dynamic covalent bonds to synthesize PRs by sequential self&#8208;assembly. First, we prepared M1 possessing two diamine structures and M2 of a bisammonium salt with two dibenzylammonium (DBA) units modified by two stoppers at its ends, then M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled into supramolecular polymers stemming from hydrogen bonding of [N+&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O] under high concentrations. After adding 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxaldehyde (M3), the imine bond formation enabled the generation of macrocycles, transforming supramolecular polymers into PRs. Besides, the solution of polyrotaxanes was applied as the adhesive for diverse hard and soft materials. This strategy provides an important approach for synthesizing PRs, accelerating the advances of mechanically interlocked polymers.

A series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesized, and they were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8208;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine.







Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are promising heterogeneous photocatalyst candidates owing to their excellent stability, conjugacy, and tunability. In this study, a series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesised and utilised as photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation reactions. The corresponding optoelectronic properties could be precisely regulated by the electronic effects of different substituents in the nanopore channels of the CTFs; these CTFs were effective photocatalysts for C&#8722;H activation in organic synthesis due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8722;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8211;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine. This strategy provides a new scaffold for the rational design of CTFs as efficient photocatalysts for organic synthesis.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Toxicity Antimicrobial Polycarbonates Bearing Lysine Residues.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial polycarbonates bearing natural amino acid residues are easy to synthesize and scale up cost&#8208;efficiently. Together with their good biocompatibility, these polymers show great potential as a new class of antibacterial biomaterials to treat bacterial infections and combat emerging antibiotic resistance.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance has been threatening public health for a long period, while the COVID pandemic aggravated the scenario. To combat antibiotic resistance strains, host defense peptides (HDPs) mimicking molecules have attracted considerable attention. Herein, we reported a series of polycarbonates bearing cationic lysine amino acid residues that could mimic the mechanism of action of HDPs and possess broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity. Moreover, those polymers had negligible toxicity toward red blood cells and mammalian cells. The membrane&#8208;disruption mechanism endows the lysine&#8208;containing polycarbonates with low possibility of resistance development and the fast killing kinetics, making them promising candidates for antimicrobial development.

         <title>Bismuth Nanoparticles and Single Iron Atoms on Carbon Derived from a Covalent Organic Framework Synergistically Catalyze the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article synthesizes a carbon catalyst in which bismuth nanoparticles and single iron atoms on covalent organic framework&#8208;derived carbon synergistically catalyze oxygen reduction reactions. The catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.867&#8197;V and a high current density of 6.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, which has great potential in oxygen reduction catalyst applications.







Abstract
The utilization of catalysts comprising metal nanoparticle has been beneficial for enhancing the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the inadequate intrinsic activity of these catalysts still presents a significant challenge, limiting their overall effectiveness. This issue can be addressed by introducing single atoms, which can create a synergistic effect with the nanoparticles to catalyse and thereby improve performance. Nevertheless, the synergistic catalysis of nanoparticles and single atoms is still under investigation. In this study, we fabricated a core&#8208;shell structured carbon framework incorporating Fe single atoms and Bi nanoparticles through the pyrolysis of COF and MOF core&#8208;shell structures. Introducing Fe single atoms into ZIF&#8208;8, with Fe&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 as the core and Bi&#8208;containing COF as the shell, resulted in higher ORR activity. The catalyst exhibited a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.867&#8197;V and a high current density of 6.68&#8197;mA&#8197;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, which were comparable to those of Pt/C equivalent.
This study provides new research concepts for exploring the application of single atoms and nanoparticles in catalytic oxygen reduction reactions through synergistic effects.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of GeTe Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of this work is preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by low temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors. The GeTe nanoparticles are amorphous and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering.







Abstract
Nanoparticles can offer an alternative approach to fabricate phase&#8208;change materials. The chemical synthesis of GeTe nanoparticles using organometallic precursors exploits high&#8208;boiling solvents and relatively high temperatures (close or even above crystallization temperatures), as reported in the available literature. The aim of this work is the preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by a low&#8208;temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors and common organic solvents. Indeed, different preparation methods and characterization of GeTe nanoparticles is discussed. The characterization of the prepared nanomaterial was performed on the basis of X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The results show that the low&#8208;temperature synthetic route leads to amorphous GeTe nanoparticles. Exploited organometallic precursor is stabilised by neutral ligand which can be isolated after the reaction and repeatedly used for further reactions. Furthermore, GeTe nanoparticle size can be tuned by the conditions of the synthesis.

         <dc:description>
The fluorination of the central ring of 1,3,5&#8208;benzene&#8208;tris&#8208;(meta&#8208;benzoate) (BTMB) leads to a twisted tritopic linker which reacts with copper(II) ions to assemble into octahedral metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with paddle&#8208;wheel units at their vertices. Crystallization from different solvents at different temperatures leads to a variety of sphere packings that are explored together with the material properties of the resulting MOCs.







Abstract
The fluorination of the central ring of 1,3,5&#8208;benzene&#8208;tris&#8208;(meta&#8208;benzoate) (referred to as BTMB) leads to a twisted tritopic linker which reacts with copper(II) ions to assemble into octahedral (pseudospherical) metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with paddle&#8208;wheel units at their vertices. In this work, the different sphere packings of these MOCs are explored in detail together with their material properties, which closely resemble those of copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Theoretical investigations of the linkers are carried out to analyze the energetic barrier imposed by the fluorine substituents to form the observed atropisomers.

&lt;p&gt;The fluorination of the central ring of 1,3,5-benzene-tris-(meta-benzoate) (BTMB) leads to a twisted tritopic linker which reacts with copper(II) ions to assemble into octahedral metal-organic cages (MOCs) with paddle-wheel units at their vertices. Crystallization from different solvents at different temperatures leads to a variety of sphere packings that are explored together with the material properties of the resulting MOCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluorination of the central ring of 1,3,5-benzene-tris-(meta-benzoate) (referred to as BTMB) leads to a twisted tritopic linker which reacts with copper(II) ions to assemble into octahedral (pseudospherical) metal-organic cages (MOCs) with paddle-wheel units at their vertices. In this work, the different sphere packings of these MOCs are explored in detail together with their material properties, which closely resemble those of copper-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Theoretical investigations of the linkers are carried out to analyze the energetic barrier imposed by the fluorine substituents to form the observed atropisomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Introduction of Molecular Complexity via the Cross&#8208;Coupling of Lithium 1,4&#8208;Dioxene with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing molecular complexity using organolithium cross&#8208;coupling chemistry: we demonstrate the Pd2(dba)3/XPhos&#8208;catalysed coupling of lithium 1,4&#8208;dioxene with aryl bromides towards 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes. We highlight the synthetic utility of these relatively unexplored scaffolds by their derivatisation into a variety of carbonyl&#8208;functionalised aromatics, and a concise two&#8208;step synthesis of an arylated antifungal agent analogue.







Abstract
The synthetic potential of substituted 1,4&#8208;dioxenes is well recognised, although the chemistry of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes is relatively unexplored. Their transition metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis has been limited to Stille&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling chemistry, typically showing long reaction times, or proceeding at high reaction temperatures. Here we present a facile and general methodology for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with lithium 1,4&#8208;dioxene, affording a range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes in generally good yields. We highlight the synthetic applicability of this transformation at multigram scale, and demonstrate the versatility of the products by conversion of the dioxene units to various carbonyl&#8208;based functionalities. Additionally, we present a concise two&#8208;step synthesis of an arylated analogue to a known 1,4&#8208;dioxene&#8208;based antifungal agent.

Rational engineering of metal tips on CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted. The optimized configuration, a gold&#8208;platinum core&#8208;shell tip with a rough surface, showed a remarkable fivefold quantum efficiency enhancement, exhibiting the maximum hydrogen&#8208;evolution rates under visible and AM1.5&#8197;G irradiation. Kinetic study reveals a large extent and a longer lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips.







Abstract
This study explores the optimal morphology of photochemical hydrogen evolution catalysts in a one&#8208;dimensional system. Systematic engineering of metal tips on precisely defined CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted to exert control over morphology, composition, and both factors. The outcome yields an optimized configuration, a Au&#8722;Pt core&#8208;shell structure with a rough Pt surface (Au@r&#8208;Pt), which exhibits a remarkable fivefold increase in quantum efficiency, reaching 86&#8201;% at 455&#8197;nm and superior hydrogen evolution rates under visible and AM1.5&#8197;G irradiation conditions with prolonged stability. Kinetic investigations using photoelectrochemical and time&#8208;resolved measurements demonstrate a greater extent and extended lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips as well as rapid water reduction kinetics on high&#8208;energy surfaces. This approach sheds light on the critical role of cocatalysts in hybrid photocatalytic systems for achieving high performance.

         <title>Computational Design of 3D Lantern Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a computational design of a new 3D Lantern Organic Framework&#8208;(LOFs) materials by using trisilasumanene and porphyrin&#8208;cored bases. Using Density Functional Theory shows that HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps of these 3D&#8208;LOFs are mainly determined by the base units, with minimal impact from vertical stacking via sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges on such a property. Consequently, 3D&#8208;LOF materials promisingly have various applications such as host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
This study employed a computational approach, particularly Density Functional Theory at B3LYP&#8722;D3/6&#8208;31+G(d) level to design two new classes of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Lantern Organic Frameworks (LOFs) materials based on trisilasumanene and porphyrin core building units. Particularly, we detail strategies for transitioning from 1D&#8208;LOF nanowires to extended 3D structures: first by connecting planar&#8208;molecule base units of trisilasumanene or porphyrin using benzene&#8208;based linkers, and then connecting silicon anchoring atoms on the bases with other bases that are vertically stacked by sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon chains. The 3D&#8208;LOF structures are designed to have different pore sizes through the use of various bases, bridges, and linkers. Comparisons of electronic properties of these 3D structures lead to one designing rule. That is, the gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the 3D materials depends only on its base and is nearly independent of the stack size or the length of the sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges. Additionally, connecting base units with linkers also extends &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation system leading to a reduction in HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. For instance, linking two trisilasumanene molecules significantly narrows HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap by 1.75&#8197;eV while stacking these bases vertically and connecting them by linear pentane&#8208;based bridges yield insignificant change to the gap.

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Boosted Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle Bromine Fixation and Corresponding Upgraded Aquatic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonication is applied to aqueous Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle&#8208;based bromine removal and upgraded applications, including silver recovery, MnO2&#8208;involved closed&#8208;loop material cycling, and battery electrode modification. With the benign and scalable acoustic boost, the efficiency of bromine fixation and related post&#8208;applications are significantly improved. The processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.







Abstract
Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl&#8208;Alkyne Metathesis Reactions</title>

The carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis is a highly useful reaction for the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now rely on molecular iodine as a cheap, mild, and highly active catalyst for both intra&#8208; and intermolecular reactions. The procedure affords the alkenes in high yields and stereoselectivities and tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Experimental and computational investigations allow a proposed mode of action.







Abstract
The reaction between aldehydes or ketones and alkynes&#8212;the carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metathesis&#8212;constitutes a very useful strategy for the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. We now demonstrate that iodine is a highly efficient catalyst for both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular metathesis reaction in very small concentrations (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). Our protocol outperforms other catalytic systems, is operationally very simple, cheap, metal&#8208;free, and tolerates a large variety of functional groups (e.&#8201;g., &#8722;CN, &#8722;CO2Me, &#8722;Br, &#8722;OH) at very low catalyst loadings. We can furthermore show that iodine&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;alkyne metatheses can be combined with other iodine&#8208;catalyzed reactions in one&#8208;pot procedures to afford larger and more complex molecular structures. Finally, our mechanistic studies indicate that the iodonium ion is the active catalyst under the reaction conditions.

         <title>Versatile Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of BODIPY and Bis(BF2) Chromophores by Using Arylazosulfones in a Sunflow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the importance of BODIPYs and BIS(BF2)&#8208;based chromophores for biological applications and the limited related synthetic strategies toward functionalization, we report an environmentally friendly and practical protocol to promote their direct arylation under sunlight with arylazosulfones as aryl radical surrogates. In total, twenty&#8208;two arylated compounds were obtained under the established conditions including the chromophores BODIPY and BOPPY.







Abstract
BODIPYs have a well&#8208;established role in biological sciences as chemosensors and versatile biological markers due to their chemical reactivity, which allows for fine&#8208;tuning of their photophysical characteristics. In this work, we combined the unique reactivity of arylazo sulfones with the advantages of a &#8220;sunflow&#8221; reactor to develop a fast, efficient, and versatile method for the photochemical arylation of BODIPYs and other chromophores. This approach resulted in red&#8208;shifted emitting fluorophores due to extended electronic delocalization at the 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of the BODIPY core. This method represents an advantageous approach for BODIPY functionalization compared to existing strategies.

         <title>Overriding Cage Effect in Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Photoactivation of Diaryliodonium Reagents: Synthesis of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electron donor&#8208;acceptor photoactivation platform of diaryliodonium reagents, where generated aryl radicals override the cage effect to get captured by dichalcogenides en route to the synthesis of a wide variety of di(hetero)aryl and aryl&#8208;alkyl chalcogenides. The chalcogenation technology applies to late&#8208;stage functionalizations and disulfide bioconjugations and facilitates access to bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
In recent times, diaryliodonium reagents (DAIRs) have witnessed a resurgence as arylating reagents, especially under photoinduced conditions. However, reactions proceeding through electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex formation with DAIRs are restricted to electron&#8208;rich reacting partners serving as donors due to the well&#8208;known cage effect. We discovered a practical and high&#8208;yielding visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced EDA platform to generate aryl radicals from the corresponding DAIRs and use them to synthesize key chalcogenides. In this process, an array of DAIRs and dichalcogenides react in the presence of 1,4 diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as a cheap and readily available donor, furnishing a variety of di(hetero)aryl and aryl/alkyl chalcogenides in good yields. The method is scalable, features a broad scope with good yields, and operates under open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions. The photoinduced chalcogenation technology is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalizations and disulfide bioconjugations and facilitates access to biologically relevant thioesters, dithiocarbamates, sulfoximines, and sulfones. Moreover, the method applies to synthesizing diverse pharmaceuticals, such as vortioxetine, promazine, mequitazine, and dapsone, under amenable conditions.

         <title>The Possible Aromatic Conjugation via the Different Edges of (Car)Borane Clusters: Can the Relationship Between 3D and 2D Aromatic Systems Be Reconciled?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 61, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between the 2D and 3D units in the (car)borane&#8208;fused 2D ring systems was investigated computationally. Although aromatic conjugation can be excluded, other factors, such as negative hyperconjugation and ring strain, play a crucial role in the overall stability of these systems and should be taken into account during their investigation.







Abstract
The possible aromatic conjugation between 3D and 2D aromatic units is in the focus since the synthesis of benzocarborane. It has been showed that in the 3D aromatic icosahedral 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborane systems fused with 2D aromatic rings a global 3D/2D aromaticity does not exist. Despite this fact during the last years several studies proposed interactions between 2D and 3D moieties. Herein, while tuning the size and the effective charge of the (car)borane systems, we demonstrate that global aromatic character can be excluded in any investigated cases, and the detectable conjugative properties can be explained the effect of the well&#8208;known negative hyperconjugation.

         <dc:description>
An electron donor&#8211;acceptor photoactivation platform of diaryliodonium reagents has been developed, in which generated aryl radicals override the cage effect to get captured by dichalcogenides en route to the synthesis of a wide variety of di(hetero)aryl and aryl&#8211;alkyl chalcogenides. The chalcogenation technology applies to late&#8208;stage functionalizations and disulfide bioconjugations, and facilitates access to bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrolytes for Magnesium Batteries: Bridging the gap between Chemistry and Electrochemistry</title>

The discovery of suitable electrolytes has been a key challenge for the research and development of rechargeable magnesium batteries. This review discusses the development of various types of electrolytes from the viewpoint of their chemistry and electrochemistry. In particular, it considers the advancement of new conductive magnesium salts and their potential applications.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have the potential to provide a sustainable and long&#8208;term solution for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to high theoretical capacity of magnesium (Mg) metal as an anode, its competitive redox potential (Mg/Mg2+:&#8722;2.37&#8197;V vs. SHE) and high natural abundance. To develop viable magnesium batteries with high energy density, the electrolytes must meet a range of requirements: high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical potential window, chemical compatibility with electrode materials and other battery components, favourable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial properties and cost&#8208;effective synthesis. In recent years, significant progress in electrolyte development has been made. Herein, a comprehensive overview of these advancements is presented. Beginning with the early developments, we particularly focus on the chemical aspects of the electrolytes and their correlations with electrochemical properties. We also highlight the design of new anions for practical electrolytes, the use of electrolyte additives to optimize anode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and the progress in polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Alkynyl Ketones and Amides to Generate Unsaturated Oxacycles and Aromatic Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade reactions of alkynyl ketones and amides involving an initial conjugate addition of secondary amine or propargylic Alder&#8208;ene reaction followed by 1,4&#8208;addition of amine, selectively generate 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans, substituted 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ones, and amine&#8208;incorporated arenes. The product distributions are sensitive to the steric and electronic factors of the substituents on both the alkyne and 1,3&#8208;diyne moieties, the tether structure connecting them, and the nature of the amine.







Abstract
We describe novel amine&#8208;mediated transformation of alkynyl ketones and amides to generate 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans, substituted 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ones, and amine&#8208;incorporated arenes. These cascade processes are initiated by conjugate addition of secondary amine followed by hydrolysis of the enamine/vinylogous amide intermediates. The product distribution is highly sensitive to the steric and electronic effects of the substituents on both the alkyne moieties, the tether structure connecting them, and the nature of the amine. Alkynyl amide participates in the Alder&#8208;ene reaction favorably to generate more reactive allene amide that reacts with amine to generate amine&#8208;incorporated arene products. These metal&#8208;free cascade reactions are a useful synthetic method that can be exploited for the construction of various hetero&#8208; and carbocyclic systems.

The use of sulfonium salts in organic synthesis has experienced a dramatic increase during the last years that can arguably be attributed to three main factors; the development of more direct and efficient synthetic methods that make easily available sulfonium reagents of a wide structural variety, their intrinsic thermal stability, which facilitates their structural modification, handling and purification even on large scale, and the recognition that their reactivity resembles that of hypervalent iodine compounds and therefore, they can be used as replacement of such reagents for most of their uses. This renewed interest has led to the improvement of already existing reactions, as well as to the discovery of unprecedented transformations; in particular, by the implementation of photocatalytic protocols. This review aims to summarize the most recent advancements on the area focusing on the work published during and after 2020. The scope of the methods developed will be highlighted and their limitations critically evaluated.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Divergent Synthesis of a 13&#8208;Ring Triquinone and its Facile Conversion to a [4.4.4]Tridecastarphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot divergent synthesis of a 13&#8208;ring triquinone that is readily converted to a [4.4.4]tridecastarphene is reported. The starphene was characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR, 13C&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry and DFT calculations, and appears suitable as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor.







Abstract
Acenes are notable for their optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronics. Starphenes are structurally related molecules possessing three acene arms that radiate linearly from a central benzene ring (i.&#8201;e., linearly annellated triphenylenes). Large starphenes have been prepared using convergent syntheses involving transition metal catalyzed cyclotrimerizations of either preformed acenes or arynes. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot divergent synthesis of a 13&#8208;ring triquinone that is readily converted to a [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative. The one&#8208;pot procedure involves the sequential reactions of three 1,4&#8208;anthraquinones with o&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives that are generated sequentially from a stable, trisulfone precursor. The resulting [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative bearing p&#8208;(t&#8208;butyl)phenyl substituents was characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR, 13C&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal a relatively high&#8208;lying HOMO orbital (about &#8722;4.70 to &#8722;4.86&#8197;eV) and a relatively small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.1&#8197;eV), suggesting utility as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative photooxidizes in a CH2Cl2 solution exposed to ambient light and air with a half&#8208;life of 150&#8197;minutes at room temperature, but shows no sign of degradation after 12&#8197;months in the solid&#8208;state. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative also shows excellent solubility in a number of organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and toluene, potentially enabling printed electronic applications.

         <title>Chiral Pd(II) Nanofiber Promoting Electron Transfer of g&#8208;C3N4 for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular nanofiber (the yellow helix in the picture) was fabricated and used as a co&#8208;catalyst to promote the charge transfer of g&#8208;C3N4 (the light pink rectangle and dark blue block represent the g&#8208;C3N4 and its CB and VB, respectively) through the chiral induced spin selectivity effect for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution.







Abstract
The rapid transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons is very important for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Here, chiral induced spin selectivity effect (CISS effect) was developed to accelerate electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. A chiral and achiral racemic supramolecular Pd(II) complex nanofiber was fabricated via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of chiral L&#8722;Py or its racemes with Pd(II) and used to modify carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). The obtained chiral photocatalyst L&#8722;Py&#8722;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4 and achiral photocatalyst Rac&#8208;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4, show enhanced photocatalytic activities with hydrogen evolution rates of 2476 and 1339&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, while that of pure g&#8208;C3N4 is 30.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Chiral photocatalyst has 85&#8201;% higher activity than achiral one and is 82.5&#8208;fold of pure g&#8208;C3N4, due to better suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs in the interface of g&#8208;C3N4 contact with chiral molecule. Spectral tests and photoelectrochemical tests proved that the chiral supramolecular Pd(II) complex can act both as an electron spin filter and hydrogen reduction catalytic center to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. This work offers a new route to facilitate electron transfer by the CISS effect for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Tuning the Steric and Electronic Properties of Hemilabile NHC ligands for Gold(I/III) Catalyzed Oxyarylation of Ethylene: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of ethylene in the presence of NHC^X hemilabile gold complexes are reported. The tuning of electronic and steric NHC^X properties, as well as of the NHC architecture, reveals that the NHC^P combination, with a low/moderate steric hindrance, is very promising for the synthesis of new gold catalyst ligands.







Abstract
Mechanistic studies on 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of ethylene promoted by gold catalysts bearing hemilabile N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC^X) ligands were conducted by DFT calculations, exploring the whole catalytic cycle. After highest energy transition state (TS) barriers were located for NHC^N gold catalyst, and experimental results with different iodoarenes and alcohols rationalized, the study was extended to modified NHC^X catalysts, to observe how electronic and steric effects could affect the rate determining step TS. Electronic effects were investigated on NHC^X (X=H, N, O, P, and S), whereas steric effects emerged when comparing catalysts with different N&#8722;R groups (R=Dipp, Mes, tBu and Me). Finally, we suggest a different catalyst design based on N&#8208;aryl N&#8208;o&#8208;donor&#8208;aryl NHC, with different donors and NHC backbones to search for better performing systems.

         <title>Photoinduced On and Off Polymeric Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based On Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This phenomenon that anthracene and phenanthrene as isomers exhibit such a difference on room temperature phosphorescence in polyvinyl alcohol matrix by B&#8722;O click reaction, indicating that irradiation can not only induce the activation of room temperature phosphorescence, but also lead to cycloaddition reaction, especially in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon system.







Abstract
As family members of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compound anthracene (Ant) and phenanthrene (Phe) as isomers are widely used in organic optical materials and electronic materials. But their photochemical and physical properties are very different. In this work, the room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties of PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Ant and PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Phe are discussed carefully which are prepared by B&#8722;O click reaction through polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with 9&#8208;anthraceneboronic acid (B&#8208;Ant) and 9&#8208;phenanthrenylboronic acid (B&#8208;Phe), respectively. PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Phe 1&#8201;% film exhibits excellent fluorescence (FL) emission at 374&#8197;nm and RTP emission at 523&#8197;nm with green afterglow and around 1.9&#8197;s phosphorescence lifetime. However, PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Ant 1&#8201;% film only shows strong blue FL emission at 414&#8197;nm, and the emission intensity decreases seriously with the extension of irradiation time. Experimental and theoretical calculations results suggest that the photodimer of Ant which is formed in PVA matrix under the UV light irradiation would be competitive with the process of RTP emission. This work demonstrates that the RTP properties of organic molecules might be probably affected by the photostability of the organic phosphor under UV irradiation.

PVA&#8722;B-Phe 1&#8201;% film exhibits excellent fluorescence (FL) emission at 374&#8197;nm and RTP emission at 523&#8197;nm with green afterglow and around 1.9&#8197;s phosphorescence lifetime. However, PVA&#8722;B-Ant 1&#8201;% film only shows strong blue FL emission at 414&#8197;nm, and the emission intensity decreases seriously with the extension of irradiation time. Experimental and theoretical calculations results suggest that the photodimer of Ant which is formed in PVA matrix under the UV light irradiation would be competitive with the process of RTP emission. This work demonstrates that the RTP properties of organic molecules might be probably affected by the photostability of the organic phosphor under UV irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Efficient Bifunctional Core&#8208;Shell ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 Composite as a Stable Pickering Interfacial Catalyst for the Deacetalization&#8211;Knoevenagel Tandem Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting advanced solid particles is crucial to the construction of Pickering emulsions catalysis. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as ideal emulsifiers stabilizing Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis. Although Pickering emulsions stabilized by core&#8208;shell MOFs have significant importance in practical studies, to date there have been very limited reports on this topic. Herein, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67, a core&#8208;shell material with simultaneous acid&#8208;base bifunctionality, was synthesized by seeded epitaxial growth. It was firstly applied as an emulsifier in Pickering emulsions to catalyze the deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel tandem reaction, which exhibited excellent catalytic properties and achieved extremely high yields. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 showed high stability and remained well repeatable after five cycles. This work provides a platform for the design of structurally and functionally diverse MOF&#8208;based Pickering emulsions interfacial catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers: Two Radical Supramolecular Interactions &#8211; A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Bound to Transition Metals: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Olefin Coordination, Reductive Elimination, and Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dibenzobismepinyl (C14H10Bi) substituted transition metal complexes of the type [(C14H10Bi)M(CO)x(L)] (M = Mn, Co, Fe) was prepared in salt elimination reactions from a halobismepine and sodium metallates. Irradiation of these complexes with visible light has been investigated, aiming at the elimination of one carbonyl ligand and the concomitant coordination of the bismepine&#8217;s olefin moiety to the transition metal center. The resulting complexes of the type [{&#954;2C,&#954;1Bi&#8208;(C14H10)Bi}M(CO)x&#8722;1(L)] (M = Co, Fe) have been isolated and fully characterized. When two dibenzobismepinyl units are positioned in the coordination sphere of an iron carbonyl complex fragment, reductive elimination / oxidative addition events of the dibismuthane (C14H10Bi)2 have been shown to be relevant. The analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Sialyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids are monosaccharide residues involved in several biological processes. Controlling the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions is challenging and mechanistic studies on the structure of its intermediate, the sialyl cation, are scarce. Here it is shown that a sialyl cation can be generated and isolated from an ionized sialic acid precursor. This short&#8208;lived species is structurally characterized for the first time using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy. In combination with quantum chemical calculations, the results reveal that the positive charge at the anomeric carbon of the sialyl cation is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group leading to the formation of a bridged structure. In this structure, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded from nucleophilic attack, potentially explaining the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of this building block in SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions. Other modes of participation are energetically unfavored and cannot be observed experimentally.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Photonic Glass for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we describe a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co&#8208;condensation of&#160;tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV&#8208;visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Borenium Ion Equivalents Stabilized by BICAAC and Their Implementation as Catalysts in Hydrosilylation of Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydride abstraction from the borane adduct, (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 afforded the hydride bridged dinuclear borenium ion equivalent complexes 1 and 2 that have been characterized by various spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques followed by the assessment of Lewis acidity using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of complex 2 revealed the presence of discrete ions in the solid state. The complex (BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(OTf) (3), obtained from the reaction of (BICAAC)&#8231;BH3 with MeOTf, forms the corresponding boronium cations [(BICAAC)&#8231;BH2(L)]+(OTf)&#8208; on reaction with Lewis bases (L = pyridine (4) and DMAP (5)). Complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notable catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of a diverse array of carbonyls using 1.0 mol% catalyst loading (achieving the highest turnover frequency (TOFmax) of up to 1200 h&#8208;1 with benzaldehyde. A broad substrate scope has been presented for aldehydes and ketones decorated with various electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing substituents along with this the hydrosilylation of a few para&#8208;quinone methides has also been presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Synthesis of C20&#8208;Epi&#8208;Isothiocyanato&#8208;Salinomycin and its Thiourea Derivatives as Potential Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C20&#8208;epi&#8208;isothiocyanate of salinomycin was designed and synthesized to serve as a versatile synthon that can react with various amines to assemble a library of 21 salinomycin thioureas. Compound 9&#8201;f showed dramatic antiproliferative activity in a selective five cancer cell lines, causing cellular late apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase.







Abstract
Salinomycin, a naturally occurring polyether ionophore antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces albus, has been demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity against a variety of cancer cell lines. In particular, it exhibits selective targeting of cancer stem cells. However, systemic toxicity, drug resistance and low bioavailability of the drug significantly limit its potential applications. In this study, the C20&#8208;epi&#8208;isothiocyanate of salinomycin was designed and synthesized, and then reacted with amines as a versatile synthon to assemble a series of salinomycin thiourea derivatives, which improved the druggability of salinomycin. The antiproliferative activities of the compounds were evaluated in&#8197;vitro against A549, HepG2, HeLa, 4T1, and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines using the CCK&#8208;8 assay. The pharmacological results showed that some salinomycin thiourea derivatives exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested tumor cells and high selectivity. Further mechanistic studies showed that compound 9&#8201;f, containing a 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzyl moiety, could directly induce apoptosis, probably by increasing caspase&#8208;9 protein expression and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase in a concentration dependent manner.

         <title>Complex Biophysical and Computational Analyses of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: The Porphyrin Stacks Back</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular docking and dynamics and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations allowed us to monitor interaction with different DNA sequences of simple cationic porphyrins. 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin bromide in particular demonstrated a better selectivity compared to tetramethylpyridylporphyrin in binding G&#8208;quadruplex with parallel topology compared with hybrid and with duplex forming oligonucleotides.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s), as non&#8208;canonical DNA structures, attract a great deal of research interest in the molecular biology as well as in the material science fields. The use of small molecules as ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes has emerged as a tool to regulate gene expression and telomeres maintenance. Meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl) porphyrin (TMPyP4) was shown as one of the first ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes and it is still widely used. We report an investigation comprising molecular docking and dynamics, synthesis and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations on simple cationic porphyrins and their interaction with different DNA sequences. This study enabled the synthesis of tetracationic porphyrin derivatives that exhibited binding and stabilizing capacity against G&#8208;quadruplex structures; the detailed characterization has shown that the presence of amide groups at the periphery improves selectivity for parallel G4&#8197;s binding over other structures. Taking into account the ease of synthesis, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl) porphyrin bromide could be considered a better alternative to TMPyP4 in studies involving G4 binding.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroaminations Catalyzed by Yttrium(III)&#8208;Bis(sulfoximine) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT&#8208;calculated transition state of the asymmetric hydroamination reaction catalyzed by a chiral yttrium complex with two C2&#8208;symmetric bis(sulfoximine)s as ligands. With catalyst loadings down to 1&#8201;% a number of amino olefins could be cyclized to N&#8208;heterocycles with up to 61&#8201;% ee. The structures and coordination modes of the involved complexes are deduced by multinuclear NMR&#8208;studies and DFT&#8208;calculations







Abstract
Bis(sulfoximine) yttrium complexes as catalysts for enantioselective intramolecular hydroaminations were prepared for the first time and characterized by a multinuclear NMR study including the nuclei 1H, 13C, 15N and 89Y. The stoichiometries of the complexes were confirmed by a Job plot. In addition to the experimental results, the 89Y NMR shifts and the complex structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating d&#8208;band center of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts is an effective approach to regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates, alter reaction pathways, reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, ultimately improve electrocatalytic water splitting performance. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in modulating the d&#8208;band center for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting is provided.







Abstract
To tackle the global energy scarcity and environmental degradation, developing efficient electrocatalysts is essential for achieving sustainable hydrogen production via water splitting. Modulating the d&#8208;band center of transition metal electrocatalysts is an effective approach to regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates, alter reaction pathways, lower the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, and ultimately improve electrocatalytic water splitting performance. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in modulating the d&#8208;band center for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting is offered. Initially, the basics of the d&#8208;band theory are discussed. Subsequently, recent modulation strategies that aim to boost electrocatalytic activity, with particular emphasis on the d&#8208;band center as a key indicator in water splitting are summarized. Lastly, the importance of regulating electrocatalytic activity through d&#8208;band center, along with the challenges and prospects for improving electrocatalytic water splitting performance by fine&#8208;tuning the transition metal d&#8208;band center, are provided.

         <title>Electrooxidative Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylation of Arylacetic Acids Towards the Synthesis of Carbonyls under Air Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation of arylacetic acids has been well established to synthesize carbonyls under mild conditions, whose application and practicality was highlighted by the conversion of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs and scale&#8208;up transformation. The protocol featured cheap materials, good functional group tolerance, simple constant current protocol and eco&#8208;friendly reaction conditions.







Abstract
After systematic realization of decarboxylative functionalization of carboxylic acids under heating conditions in our group, we herein reported an electrochemical method for Ni&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation of arylacetic acids under open air conditions. The protocol provided corresponding carbonyls including aldehydes and ketones in moderate to satisfactory yields with good functional group tolerance, furthermore, the practicability and advantage of the method was highlighted through Ni&#8208;catalyzed oxidative decarboxylation of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs and preformation of scalable transformation. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the possible involvement of free radical intermediate in the conversion.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of a Halogenated Borazine: From Supramolecular Assemblies to a Random Covalent BN&#8208;Substituted Carbon Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface reactions of a functionalized borazine, tetrabromoborazine, yield distinct BN&#8208;substituted carbon scaffolds, including an intricate kagom&#233; architecture and a random covalent network. This work, based on low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, provides insights into the surface chemistry of BN precursors.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface synthesis strategy has emerged as a promising route for fabricating well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BN&#8208;substituted carbon nanomaterials with tunable electronic properties. This approach relies on specially designed precursors and requires a thorough understanding of the on&#8208;surface reaction pathways. It promises precise structural control at the atomic scale, thus complementing chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this study, we investigated a novel heteroatomic precursor, tetrabromoborazine, which incorporates a BN core and an OH group, on Ag(111) using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT&#8208;STM/STS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Through sequential temperature&#8208;induced reactions involving dehalogenation and dehydrogenation, distinct tetrabromoborazine derivatives were produced as reaction intermediates, leading to the formation of specific self&#8208;assemblies. Notably, the resulting intricate supramolecular structures include a chiral kagom&#233; lattice composed of molecular dimers exhibiting a unique electronic signature. The final product obtained was a random covalent carbon network with BN&#8208;substitution and embedded oxygen heteroatoms. Our study offers valuable insights into the significance of the structure and functionalization of BN precursors in temperature&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface reactions, which can help future rational precursor design. Additionally, it introduces complex surface architectures that offer a high areal density of borazine cores.

         <title>A Rare Example of a Gallium&#8208;Based Lewis Superacid: Synthesis and Reactivity of Ga(OTeF5)3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid Ga(OTeF5)3 has been synthesized and its exceptionally high Lewis acidity has been evaluated. The compound is one of only a few examples of a hard and soft gallium&#8208;based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity allowed to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5 and the oxidizer Xe(OTeF5)2 in the synthesis of reactive oxonium and chloronium salts.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid Ga(OTeF5)3 has been synthesized and characterized, revealing a monomeric structure in solution and a dimeric structure in the solid state. Isolated adducts of Ga(OTeF5)3 with strong and weak Lewis bases have been characterized spectroscopically as well as by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The Lewis acidity of this new species has been evaluated by means of different experimental and theoretical methods, which has allowed to classify it as one of only a few examples of a gallium&#8208;based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity of Ga(OTeF5)3 was used to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5, leading to the protonation of diethyl ether. Furthermore, Ga(OTeF5)3 was utilized to access the strong oxidizing system Ga(OTeF5)3/Xe(OTeF5)2 in SO2ClF, which was successfully employed in the synthesis of the dimethyl chloronium salt [Cl(CH3)2][Ga(OTeF5)4], a strong electrophilic methylation reagent.

         <title>The Fabrication of ZIF&#8208;L Derived Zns/Mos2@NC Anode Materials for Remarkable Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ZnMo&#8208;ZIF&#8722;L precursors was achieved by introducing a Mo source in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio during ZIF&#8722;L synthesis. Subsequent to high&#8208;temperature carbonization and vulcanization treatment, ZnS/MoS2@NC composite materials were successfully synthesized. Compared to the unvulcanized ZnO/MoO3@NC and MoS2 samples, the ZnS/MoS2@NC composite exhibits remarkable lithium storage performance.







Abstract
The enhancement of electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries can be achieved through the incorporation of MoS2 with carbon materials and various metal sulfides. In this study, a ZnS/MoS2 heterostructure was developed, featuring a two&#8208;dimensional nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (NC) backbone. The synthesis of ZnMoZIF&#8722;L precursors was accomplished by introducing a Mo source in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio during the ZIF&#8722;L synthesis process. Following high&#8208;temperature carbonization and vulcanization treatment, ZnS/MoS2@NC composite materials were successfully synthesized. Compared to the unvulcanized ZnO/MoO3@NC and MoS2 samples, the ZnS/MoS2@NC composite exhibits remarkable lithium storage performance. At a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial reversible capacity capacity is still as high as 1674&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, this composite material demonstrates optimal rate capabilities and a significant contribution to pseudocapacitance. The nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon framework effectively mitigates volume changes, while the heterostructural design provides more active sites for lithium&#8208;ions, thereby enhancing lithium storage performance.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Scholl&#8208;Type Reactions of 1,2&#8208;Terphenyls to Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widely used Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation is often still a mechanistic mystery. Here, bis&#8208;(disubstituted) 1,2&#8208;terphenyls were studied to get a deeper insight into position and electron nature of substituents to triphenylene formation. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest whether it is preferably a radical cation or arenium&#8208;ion mechanism that led to product formation.







Abstract
A series of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208; and 4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;dimethoxy terphenyls with different second substituents on their ortho&#8208;positions have been synthesized and investigated upon the possibility to be oxidatively cyclodehydrogenated to the corresponding triphenylenes under Scholl&#8208;type conditions. The experimentally obtained selectivities were supported and explained by quantum chemical calculations and conclusions on the involved mechanisms (acid catalyzed arenium&#8208;ion mechanism (AIM) vs radical cation mechanism) were drawn.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;- and 4,4&#8217;&#8217;-dimethoxy terphenyls with different second substituents on their &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-positions have been synthesized and investigated upon the possibility to be oxidatively cyclodehydrogenated to the corresponding triphenylenes under Scholl-type conditions. The experimentally obtained selectivities were supported and explained by quantum chemical calculations and conclusions on the involved mechanisms (acid catalyzed arenium-ion mechanism (AIM) vs radical cation mechanism) were drawn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Composites containing two different types of reinforcements offer a wide range of possibilities and synergistic properties. This study investigates the hybridization effect of chemically active fly ash (FA) (5 wt.%) on the composites made from alkali (1 wt.%) &#8208; APTES silane (2 wt.%) treated Himalayan agave fibers (HAF) (25 wt.%) and polypropylene (PP). Prior to FA activation, the planetary ball mill was used to suitably reduce the particle size of the FA with was confirmed by the dynamic light scattering approach. Secondary reinforcement FA was modified with APTES silane (1 wt.%), followed by treatment with graphene oxide (GO) (0.5, 0.75, and 1 wt.%). The highest tensile strength of 40.47 MPa and modulus of 1.49 GPa were observed for the hybrid composites fabricated from 0.75 and 1.0 wt.% GO treated fly ash. Interestingly, this trend differed for flexural properties, and the highest flexural strength of 53.52 MPa was demonstrated by 0.5 wt.% GO treated FA hybrid composite. Thermal characterization revealed that addition of fiber increased crystallinity but decreased thermal stability, whereas a good wettability of the fiber and FA in matrix was demonstrated through morphological characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimides from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using a vibratory ball mill: bromination, imidization and Heck&#8208;type reactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of 9 core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues is reported via a 3&#8208;step solvent free synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using only mechanochemical activation. Selective dibromination and subsequent dimidiation were achieved for the first time in a vibratory ball mill, resulting in the key structural intermediate, 2,6&#8208;dibromonaphthalenediimide (DBND), which is the basis for elaboration into a multitude of organic electronic materials. Our new synthesis of DBND is achieved in just 5 hours&#8217; reaction time over two steps compared to typical solution state times of 24 hours. Subsequent Heck&#8208;type cross coupling reactions, with a range of styrene residues, produced a series of c&#8208;NDIs in good yields. The Heck&#8208;type reactions are rapid (1.5 hours), require no additional heating or solvent and are tolerant of atmospheric moisture and air.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;P type charge compensatory synergistic effect for Schottky and efficient photoelectrocatalysis applications: Doping mechanism in (Nb/Re)@WS2/graphene heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Band gap engineering based on doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has shown great potential in the design and development of new nano photoelectronic devices and their application in photoelectrocatalysis. However, there are two key issues that are difficult to take into account, namely the impurity levels induced by dopant atoms appear in the forbidden band of the doping system, which can become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, thereby reducing the photocatalytic efficiency. Compared with the carrier mobility of the corresponding doped systems, that of intrinsic 2D TMDs is too low. Understanding the doping mechanism of heteroatoms in these systems and designing corresponding crystal structures rationally is important for solving these problems. In this study, the crystal structures of co&#8208;doped monolayer WS2 with Nb and Re atoms were designed using density functional theory, and doping systems with graphene (high carrier mobility) were assembled into a heterostructure using the concept of heterorecombination. The N&#8208;P type co&#8208;doping of Nb and Re atoms retained the continuous band characteristics of the original monolayer WS2 while also providing the high carrier mobility of graphene, yielding an excellent multipurpose material for manufacturing high&#8208;speed Schottky devices and efficient water&#8208;splitting H evolution catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Amphiphiles Based on Azadipyrromethenes: Consecutive Pathways to Nanodiscs and Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dyes 1a, b was constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units which were respectively modified with two hydrophobic alkyl and two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. The spectroscopic and morphological studies revealed the consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways of 1a in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent. The monomers of 1a firstly aggregated into the kinetic&#8208;controlled, nanodisc&#8208;shaped Agg. I upon cooling and the latter spontaneously transformed into the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a nanosheet morphology. While the non&#8208;fluorescent Agg. I displayed a broad absorption band (&#955;max = 594 nm), the Agg. II displayed a more intensive and narrowed J&#8208;band (&#955;max =693 nm) and a fluorescence band with a maximum at 760 nm (&#1060;fl = 0.1), which could be ascribed to the J&#8208;aggregation induced emission enhancement. The kinetics of Agg. I to Agg. II transformation was further modulated by seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization with various ratios of Seedagg.II, in which the transformation rate was significantly increased by ca. 2 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. The supramolecular amphiphile 1b bearing longer hydrophilic chains formed only one type aggregate, which exhibited spectroscopic and morphological properties that were highly comparable with that of Agg. I.</dc:description>

         <title>Origins of Catalysis in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone Lysine Demethylase KDM4A with Differently Methylated Histone H3 Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Histone lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A), a non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the demethylation of tri&#8208;methylated lysine residues at the 9, 27, and 36 positions of histone H3 (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3). These methylated residues show contrasting transcriptional roles; therefore, understanding KDM4A&#8217;s catalytic mechanisms with these substrates is essential to explain the factors that control the different sequence&#8208;dependent demethylations. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD)&#8208;based combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to investigate determinants of KDM4A catalysis with H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 substrates. In KDM4A&#8208;H3(5&#8208;14)K9me3 and KDM4A&#8208;H3(23&#8208;32)K27me3 ferryl complexes, the O&#8208;H distance positively correlates with the activation barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step, however in the KDM4A&#8208;H3(32&#8208;41)K36me3, no direct one&#8208;to&#8208;one relationship was found implying that the synergistic effects between the geometric parameters, second sphere interactions and the intrinsic electric field contribute for the effective catalysis for this substrate. The intrinsic electric field along the Fe&#8208;O bond changes between the three complexes and shows a positive correlation with the HAT activation barrier, suggesting that modulating electric field can be used for fine engineering KDM catalysis with a specific substrate. The results reveal how KDM4A uses a combination of strategies to enable near equally efficient demethylation of different H3Kme3 residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaching Dynamic Behaviors of Life through Systems Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intricate interplay of metabolic reactions and molecular assembly in living systems enables spatiotemporally organization and gives rise to diverse dynamic behaviors that characterize life. Over the last decades, research efforts have increasingly focused on replicating the remarkable properties and characteristics of living systems, driving the rapid growth of systems chemistry. This young discipline which generally studies interacting molecular networks and emergent system&#8208;level properties, behaviors, and functions, offers new concepts and tools to tackle the complexity of life. In this review paper, we have explored seminal research and recent advancements in recreating dynamic behaviors of life with systems chemistry. We believe that the recreation of the dynamic behaviors of life through systems chemistry would set the initial steps to obtain synthetic life de novo.</dc:description>

This young discipline which generally studies interacting molecular networks and emergent system-level properties, behaviors, and functions, offers new concepts and tools to tackle the complexity of life. In this review paper, we have explored seminal research and recent advancements in recreating dynamic behaviors of life with systems chemistry. We believe that the recreation of the dynamic behaviors of life through systems chemistry would set the initial steps to obtain synthetic life de novo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Induction of a Tetrakis(porphyrin) in Various Chiral Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions offer an alternative way for developing stimulus&#8208;responsive materials such as sensors, machines, and drug&#8208;delivery systems. We recently reported that a urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) forms one&#8208;handed helical supramolecular polymers in solution in response to chirality of chiral solvents. Conformational changes in helical sense were detected using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which showed that the tetrakis(porphyrin) can possibly be used as a sensor for determining the enantiomeric excess of a chiral analyte. Hence, we studied the scope and limitations of the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) to deepen the understanding of tetrakis(porphyrin)&#8208;based chiral sensing systems. Herein, we report the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) in various chiral solvents, which was found to be CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents. Notably, the tetrakis(porphyrin) was CD active in a cryptochiral molecular solvent, which is exciting because the chiralities of acyclic saturated hydrocarbons are hard to sense. Consequently, this study highlights the potential advantages of supramolecular chiral sensors capable of targeting a wide range of analytes, including molecules that are absorption&#8208;silent in the UV/vis region, ones devoid of anchoring functional groups, and acyclic, saturated hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>The Roles of Molecular Concavities in the Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Giant Tetrahedra for CO2 Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant tetrahedral molecules have sparked significant interest in the past decade due to their unique and diverse supramolecular nanostructures. The longer and bulkier peripheral substituents create deep molecular concavities and thus contribute to the different self&#8208;assembly behaviors compared to the conventional small tetrahedral molecules. In this study, a molecular giant tetrahedra, TetraNDI, was synthesized to investigate the important roles of the molecular concavities in the self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Single&#8208;crystal structural characterizations indicate that the TetraNDI takes its trigonal concavities to form 1D supramolecular columns, and its tetragonal concavities to reach close inter&#8208;columnar packing. The difficulty in occupying the concavities leads to the path&#8208;dependent phase behaviors of the giant tetrahedra. It is also found that the remaining molecular concavities in the supramolecular scaffolds affect the CO2 affinity of TetraNDI. With an understanding of the packing principles of molecular giant tetrahedra, the structure&#8208;property relationships could be better evaluated in the future and might broaden the horizon of porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>B12&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation of Carbon Tetrahalides: Using a Broad Range of Visible Light to Access Diverse Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic synthesis is a green and sustainable method for producing fine chemicals and is highly desirable at both laboratory and industrial scales. In this study, we developed a broad&#8208;range (including the red region) visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carbonylation of CCl4, CBr4, and CBr3F with nucleophiles, such as amines and alcohols, using a B12&#8211;Mg2+/TiO2 hybrid catalyst. Carbonyl molecules such as ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides were synthesized with high selectivity and efficiency under mild conditions. Diffuse reflectance UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, femtosecond time&#8208;resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed the reaction mechanism is a combination of SN2 and single&#8208;electron transfer. This is a rare example of a low&#8208;energy, red&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis, which has been a highly desired organic reaction in recent years. We believe that this study provides a general platform to access diverse carbonyl molecules and could promote photocatalytic carbonylation reactions on a pilot scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Ruthenium(II)&#8722;Halocarbon Complexes Derived from Ru(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Homopropargylic Halopyridines: Mechanism, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of various homopropargylic pyridines by cis&#8208;[RuII/OsII(dppm)2Cl2] (dppm = 1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) has previously been shown to generate a diverse array of metallacycles and metalated heterocyclic complexes. However, a minor structural modification of introducing a halide onto the pyridyl group of the alkyne substrate resulted in the formation of unprecedented Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes. These complexes display (1) &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizine chelates arising from the cycloisomerization of HC&#8801;CC(OH)(CH2(6&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;py))(Ph) on [RuII/OsII(dppm)2]2+ moieties via a vinylidene pathway, (2) five&#8208;membered Ru/Os&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C rings (X = F, Cl, Br) ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;fused to quinolizinium skeletons, and (3) uncommon M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions that are atypical in coordination complexes. Despite being divalent and integrated into a five&#8208;membered Ru&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C ring system, the X atoms in the Ru(II) complexes are susceptible to substitution by O in the presence of &#8722;OH, resulting in the formation of quinolizinium&#8208;fused ruthenaoxazole complexes. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic or coordination designs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Electron&#160;NO to N2O Pathways via Heme Models and Lewis Acid: Metal Effects&#160;and Differences from the Enzymatic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some pathogens use heme&#8208;containing nitric oxide reductases (NORs) to reduce NO to N2O as their defense mechanism to detoxify NO and reduce nitrosative stress. This reduction is also significant in the global N cycle. Our previous experimental work showed that Fe and Co porphyrin NO complexes can couple with external NO to form N2O when activated by the Lewis acid BF3. A key difference from conventional two&#8208;electron enzymatic reaction is that one electron is sufficient. However, a complete understanding of the entire reaction pathways and the more favorable reactivity for Fe remains unknown. Here, we present a quantum chemical study to provide such information. Our results confirmed Fe&#8217;s higher experimental reactivity, showing advantages in all steps of the reaction pathway: easier metal oxidation for NO reduction and N&#8208;O cleavage as well as a larger size to expedite the N/O coordination mode transition. The Co system, with a similar product energy as the enzyme, shows potential for further development in catalytic NO coupling. This work also offers the first evidence that this new one&#8208;electron NO reduction is both kinetically competitive and thermodynamically more favorable than the native pathway, supporting future initiatives in optimizing NO reduction agents in biology, environment, and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Nanoclusters Imparted Metalloporphyrin based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems. Here, a series of hybrid elelctrocatalysts (Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M, M = Fe, Co and Ni) have been prepared by assembly Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) and successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. In the obtained MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M = Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co achieves high FECO (100%), CO generation rate (10.9 mol m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1) and energy efficiency (69%), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

In the obtained MOF-545-M (M = Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF-545-M (M = Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF-545-Co achieves high FECO (100%), CO generation rate (10.9 mol m-2 h-1) and energy efficiency (69%), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF-545-Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inhibition of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregation and cholinesterase activity are two major therapeutic targets for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Multifunctional Molecules (MFMs) specifically designed to address other contributing factors, such as metal ion induced abnormalities, oxidative stress, toxic Ab aggregates etc. are very much required. Several multifunctional molecules have been developed using different molecular scaffolds. Reported herein is a new series of four MFMs based on ThT, Azo&#8208;stilbene and metal ion chelating pockets. The synthesis, characterization, and metal chelation ability for [Cu(II) and Zn(II)] are presented herein. Furthermore, we explored their multifunctionality w.r.t. to their (i) recognition of A&#946; aggregates and monomeric form, (ii) utility in modulating the aggregation pathways of both metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;bound amyloid&#8208;&#946;, (iii) ex&#8208;vivo staining of amyloid plaques in 5xFAD mice brain sections, (iv) ability to scavenge free radicals and (v) ability to inhibit cholinesterase activity. Molecular docking studies were also performed with A&#946; peptides and acetylcholinesterase enzyme to understand the observed inhibitory effect on activity. Overall, the studies presented here establish the multifunctional nature of these molecules and qualify them as promising candidates for furthermore investigation in the quest for finding Alzheimer&#8217;s disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic radicals are gaining significant interest in luminescent materials due to their unique properties, which present unprecedented opportunities for innovation across various fields, from display technology to biomedical applications. However, addressing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency is crucial to unlocking their full potential for practical applications. Polymerization has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance intra&#8208; and interchain through&#8208;space interactions, enabling the creation of stable luminescent radicals with excellent processing and multifunctional properties. This concept emphasizes the strategic use of polymerization in designing and synthesizing stable main&#8208;chain and side&#8208;chain radical polymers.

         <title>Highly efficient and selective synthesis of renewable isoprene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of renewable isoprene continues to attract significant interest, yet catalysts still need improvement for industrial applications. We report herein an efficient and novel Prins tandem approach for highly selective production of isoprene from bio&#8208;based methanol and isobutene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 acid&#8208;base bifunctional catalysts. Hydration decreases the number of strong basic sites O2&#8208; ions and increases OH groups over MgO, thus improving the isoprene selectivity. Basic OH on Mg(OH)2 promotes the Prins condensation of formaldehyde and isobutene, while acidic OH promotes dehydration of isoprenol to isoprene. Suitable contents and proportions of basic and acidic OH groups over Mg(OH)2 increase isoprene selectivity and methanol conversion to 90 and 92% on the Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O+Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts, respectively. It exhibits good recycling stability, with isoprene selectivity remaining 90% after five successive regenerations. DFT calculations reveal OH groups formed after hydration reduce the energy barrier of the H transfer step, thereby promoting the overall reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Substituted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with Windmill Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and computational investigation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Following our method for the preparation of thioether&#8208;substituted HBCs, we prepared pyrrole&#8208;, indole&#8208;, carbazole&#8208;, and 1H&#8208;benz[g]indole&#8208;substituted HBCs from the corresponding fluorinated precursors under microwave irradiation. A series of polysubstituted benzoindole&#8208;HBCs with windmill architectures was also synthesized using the polyfluorinated HBC analogs. Due to the circular arrangement of the benzoindole moiety, the attachment of multiple substituents results in the presence of multiple conformers at room temperature. The rotation barrier can be overcome by heating the compounds to 323&#8208;333 K. Additionally, the investigation of the relaxed geometries shows two &#960;&#8208;stacking motifs within the conformers. Similar to the thioether substituted HBCs, the nature of the heterocycle does not influence the optoelectronic properties of the HBC core. The attachment of multiple benzoindole substituents leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission spectra, comparable to our previous studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;alternant Benzodifluoranthene Tetraimides from 7,8,9,10&#8208;Fluoranthene Diimides: Synthesis, Structure, and Optical&#8208;Limiting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel tetraimide&#8208;functionalized non&#8208;alternant &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely, benzodifluoranthene tetraimides (BDFTI), has been designed and synthesized through highly efficient UV&#8208;photocyclization of a vinyl&#8208;bridged fluoranthene diimide dimer (i.e., FDI&#8208;V). The synthesis of FDI&#8208;V starts from a straightforward three&#8208;step route to produce novel 7,8,9,10&#8208;fluoranthene diimide (FDIs) building&#8208;blocks, followed by nearly complete bromination and then Stille&#8208;coupling reaction to give the desired dimer. The analysis by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms a near&#8208;coplanar geometry for FDIs, while BDFTI shows a U&#8208;shaped and distorted backbone configuration proven by theoretical optimizations. The tetraimide BDFTI exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red&#8208;shift in photoluminescence spectra. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of additional electron&#8208;deficient imide units, which promotes increased intramolecular charge transfer and improved electron affinity. All the imides show a local aromatic characteristic owing to the incorporation of pentagon rings in the &#960;&#8208;frameworks. The fully fused BDFTI exhibits nonlinear optical properties as analyzed by the open&#8208;aperture Z&#8208;scan technique, demonstrating superior optical&#8208;limiting performance compared to vinyl&#8208;bridged FDI&#8208;V. The versatile UV&#8208;photocyclization chemistries provide a pathway for developing complex and unique multiimide&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, paving the way for creating high&#8208;performance optical&#8208;limiting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A strongly coupled 1T'&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals heterostructure for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution at high current densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for high current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a pressing requirement for commercial industrial electrolyzers. In this study, a vertical 1T'&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals heterostructure was developed through interface engineering to enhance the advantages of each component and expose numerous active sites. Experimental investigations and density functional theory&#160;calculations demonstrate significant electronic coupling at the interface between 1T'&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2, with suitable Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption. The 1T'&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 heterostructure catalyst achieves high current density HER with low overpotentials of 191 mV to generate up to 800 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, outperforming commercial 5% Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits rapid reaction kinetics and long&#8208;term durability, illustrating a successful approach to designing efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for hydrogen production through interface engineering.</dc:description>

Experimental investigations and density functional theory&#160;calculations demonstrate significant electronic coupling at the interface between 1T'-ReSe2 and 2H-MoSe2, with suitable Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption. The 1T'-ReSe2@2H-MoSe2 heterostructure catalyst achieves high current density HER with low overpotentials of 191 mV to generate up to 800 mA/cm2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, outperforming commercial 5% Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits rapid reaction kinetics and long-term durability, illustrating a successful approach to designing efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for hydrogen production through interface engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skeletal Isomerization of Ergosterol&#8208;5,8&#8208;peroxide Leading to the Discovery of Unprecedented Ergostanes and Collective Syntheses of 5,6&#8208;Epoxysterols and (+)&#8208;Sarocladione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal isomerization of ergosterol peroxide, a primary oxidation product of ergosterol, was investigated under thermal and iron(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. Thermal isomerization resulted in not only the isolation of the predicted 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,6&#8208;epoxides but also the discovery of the unprecedented 7/9/5&#8208;ring&#8208;fused ergostane for the first time. The iron(II)&#8208;mediated isomerization proceeded at ambient temperature, resulting in the formation of the expected 5,6&#8208;epoxysterols and a ring&#8208;opened bicyclic diketone. The diketone was further converted into novel ergostane under thermal conditions and into (+)&#8208;sarocladione under acidic conditions. All transformations from ergosterol to sarocladione, including the isolation of the unstable diketone intermediate, were achieved at ambient temperature, confirming the biosynthetic pathway of sarocladione. Several mushroom ingredients with a 5,6&#8208;epoxy group were synthesized stereoselectively from the isomerization products, leading to the confirmation or revision of the structures of natural products. The &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of synthetic sterols was evaluated for the first time to gain insights into the potential for dementia prevention. This study is valuable both for supplying rare sterols found in mushrooms for biological studies and for shedding light on the oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Engineering of Flower&#8208;like Co 2 P/WO 3&#8208;x /Carbon Cloth Catalysts with Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Constructing an efficient and low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is critical for improving the performance of electrolysis in alkaline water. In this study, a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst of flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide (Co2P/WO3&#8208;x/CC) was prepared on carbon cloth (CC)&#160;surface by hydrothermal reaction with solution immersion etching and phosphorization annealing under H2/Ar atmosphere. This strategy can generate oxygen vacancies (OV), improving the speed of charge transfer between cobalt phosphide (Co2P) and tungsten oxide (WO3&#8208;x) components. The catalyst greatly increases the electrochemical active surface area, which is beneficial for efficient oxygen evolution. Electrochemical testing studies show that in 1.0 M KOH solution, Co2P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC catalyst exhibits good OER activity, with a low overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a small Tafel slope of 58.32 mV dec&#8208;1. The synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Co2P with WO3&#8208;x&#160;can regulate electronic structures, expose more active sites, and cooperatively enhancing the OER activity. This study provides a workable strategy for preparing efficient non&#8208;noble metal OER electrocatalysts on engineered interfaces and OV.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Reactions of Aminocatalytic Dienamines and Trienamines Initiated by a Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloadditions are widely accepted as a group of reactions that rapidly generate molecular complexity. Being highly atom economic and often predictable, these reactions can generate up to four stereogenic centers and two C&#8208;C (or C&#8208;X) bonds in one reaction step. During the last two decades, asymmetric aminocatalysis has shown to be a successful strategy for controlling stereoselectivity and enabling reactivity of cycloaddition reactions. By increasing the conjugation of the carbonyl species employed, dienamines and trienamines can be catalytically formed. Not only can these facilitate the cycloaddition, often accompanied by high levels of stereocontrol, but they also leave a residual enamine or carbonyl (by hydrolysis) in the cycloadduct. This residual functionality can engage in further intramolecular reactions generating complex cyclic systems in a one&#8208;pot cascade manner. In this regard, asymmetric aminocatalysis can add another layer of complexity to the already complex nature of cycloadditions. In this review, we will present the general concept of such reactivity patterns of dienamines and trienamines, and hereafter showcase examples in the literature. We aspire that the chemical community can use these concepts to design new enantioselective aminocatalytic cascade reactions to access enantioenriched, complex compounds, and perhaps use these in complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenazinium&#8208; and Malachite Green&#8208;Based Pd(II) Cages: Chiroptical Discrimination of Nucleoside Triphosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic chromophores have been successfully implemented into supramolecular systems to bestow them with distinct photophysical properties for various applications, ranging from solar energy conversion, photochemical reactions or as receptors for guest molecules with optical readout. We had previously introduced first members of the large family of coal&#8208;tar dyes (methylene blue, crystal violet and rhodamine) as integral components of coordination cages. Here, we add two new chromophores, malachite green (MGP) and a purple phenazinium dye (PHP), serving as backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate banana&#8208;shaped ligands with pyridine donors. We show the formation of corresponding green and purple coloured Pd2L4 coordination cages and investigate their interaction with chiral guest molecules via UV&#8208;Vis and CD spectroscopy. The PHP cage can be used to recognize nucleoside triphosphates, based on chirality transfer from the guests to the structurally flexible helicate. In combination with the already known methylene blue cage MBP we could further differentiate between all four canonical NTPs through characteristic changes in the observed CD signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Challenges of Hyperpolarizing Substrates with Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in an MRI System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in biomolecules and their administration as imaging agents enables in&#8208;vivo monitoring of metabolism. This approach has demonstrated potential for deriving imaging biomarkers for cancer detection, differentiation, and therapy efficacy assessment. The in situ generation of polarized substrates using a permanent addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated precursor inside the bore of an MRI system used for subsequent imaging circumvents the need for a dedicated external polarizer. This approach reduces polarization loss associated with sample transfer, minimizes hardware requirements and cost, and results in reduced spatial requirements. However, performing INEPT&#8208;like pulsed sequences for heteronuclear spin&#8208;order transfer in the bore of an MRI system is challenged by poor uniformity of static and excitation magnetic field and molecular convection during the polarization transfer. Therefore, here we characterize these effects, implement a robust modification to the pulse sequence, and measure experimentally the polarization improvement upon modification of the sequence. After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a 13C polarization of 44.5% for 50 mM of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6. Our parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of the diferrocenylphosphenium ion [Fc2P]+ was extended to the heavier diferrocenylpnictogenium ions, [Fc2E]+ (E = As, Sb, Bi). The lighter diferrocenylnitrenium ion, [Fc2N]+, was detected by mass spectrometry, but could not be isolated. The molecular structures of [Fc2E]+ (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) reveal intramolecular coordination of the iron atoms, which counterbalance the electron deficiency of the pnictogens without affecting the strong Lewis acidities, which were determined according to the method of Gutmann and Beckett. The (electro&#8208;)chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the dications [Fc2E]2+ (E = P (unstable), As) and the neutral dipnictogens Fc2EEFc2 (E = P, As).</dc:description>

         <title>When the Study of the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Method on a 1D Spin Crossover Coordination Polymer Highlights its Catalytic Activity.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We are interested in studying the catalytic activity of the spin crossover (SCO) complex ([Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2). In this work, we demonstrate that, by adapting the experimental conditions, we can switch from a quantitative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) reaction to the use of this complex as a catalyst for the formation of imine from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole. During the catalytic reaction, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first is the action of the aldehyde on the NH2 groups present on the complex, whereas the second PSM reaction occurs between the imine complex and aminotriazole, leading back to the starting complex. These two PSM reactions are at least partially involved in the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the combination of these two PSM reactions enables us to modulate the particle size and shape of the final amine complex without altering its excellent SCO properties. This result is of interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where particle size has a strong influence on the catalytic activity, and for the proper integration in devices for different applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Substituted Hybrid Zinc Halides with Remarkable Dielectric Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile and attractive for their structural tunability and rich functional properties. However, the substantial improvement of the dielectric switching operating range is limited near room temperature, and obtaining ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region is a major challenge. Herein, a remarkable dielectric switching effect is reported with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region in a hybrid halide system, caused by dipolar orientational polarization ascribing order&#8208;disorder phase transitions. The new A2BX4 hybrid halide [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnBr4 (4PBA&#8208;ZnBr4) with an ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#160;K near room temperature is designed successfully through halogen substitution. Meanwhile, structurally similar hybrid materials 4PBA&#8208;ZnI4 were designed as controls. More interestingly, the crystal structure, phase transition temperature (Tc), dielectric and semiconductor properties exhibit significant discrepancies as the halogen atoms vary from Br to I. This discovery provides an efficiently regulated anionic framework to construct hybrid halides with ultra&#8208;wide high dielectric switching and reliable cycling stability by assembling with various cations, making them potentially excellent candidates for highly responsive room temperature smart switches or transducer devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Triarylmethanol Derivatives with Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylmethyl&#8208;based compounds such as rhodamines and fluoresceine representing an old and well&#8208;known class of triphenylmethane dyes, are widely used in fluorescent labeling of bioimaging. Inspired by ultralong room temperature phosphorescence of triphenylphosphine derivatives, herein we report a methoxy substituted triarylmethanol ((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethanol, LJW&#8208;1) exhibits ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) under ambient condition with afterglows of about 7 seconds. Its multiple C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; intermolecular interactions, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bond and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are beneficial for forming rigid environment in the aggregated state which is evidently an important factor in the appearance of excellent RTP. Different substituents on triarylmethanol result in compounds with different lifetimes varying from 7 &#181;s to 818 ms. The substituent effects on the phosphorescence of triarylmethanol derivatives provide an efficient method for the design of organic RTP materials and may be enlightening the phosphorescence research of triarylmethanol derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dots Enabling High&#8208;Performances Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs), known for their quantum size, abundant surface functional groups, excellent biocompatibility, and non&#8208;toxicity, have emerged as promising candidates for enhancing various advanced rechargeable batteries. Recent research indicates that electrodes based on or modified with CDs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics such as Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and capacity compared to traditional electrodes. Several key impacts of CDs contribute to these enhancements, including increased conductivity due to their conductive graphitized core, rich absorption sites, and excellent dispersity facilitated by abundant surface functional groups. These features accelerate ion transport through interface edges and ion diffusion paths, inhibit electrode material dissolution, buffer electrode material volume expansion, ensure electrode uniformity and stability, and promote the electrochemical reaction process between the electrode and electrolyte. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential of CDs to significantly advance SIB technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Na ions doped Fe2VO4 cathode for high performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries are thought to be a new generation of secondary batteries that will replace lithium ion batteries due to their great safety and inexpensive cost. In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370 mAh g&#8208;1 at a current density of 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and when the current density is arising 5 A g&#8208;1, the specific capacity also reaches 200 mAh g&#8208;1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50 mAh g&#8208;1. The superior electrochemical performance proves that FVO&#8208;Na is an ideal cathode material for zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine Labeling and 19F NMR Spectroscopy to Study Biological Molecules and Molecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy represents a key methodology for studying biomolecules and their interplay with other molecules. Recent developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to incorporate fluorine into proteins and peptides reliably, with manageable efforts and, importantly, in a highly site&#8208;specific manner. Paired with its excellent NMR spectroscopic properties and absence in most biological systems, fluorine has enabled scientists to investigate a rather wide range of scientific objectives, including protein folding, protein dynamics and drug discovery.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy represents a key methodology for studying biomolecules and their interplay with other molecules. Recent developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to incorporate fluorine into proteins and peptides reliably, with manageable efforts and, importantly, in a highly site-specific manner. Paired with its excellent NMR spectroscopic properties and absence in most biological systems, fluorine has enabled scientists to investigate a rather wide range of scientific objectives, including protein folding, protein dynamics and drug discovery. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopic experiments can be conducted in complex environments, such as cell lysate or directly inside living cells. This review presents selected studies demonstrating how&#160;19F NMR spectroscopic approaches enable to contribute to the understanding of biomolecular processes. Thereby the focus has been set to labeling strategies available and specific NMR experiments performed to answer the underlying scientific objective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive Supramolecular Nanoprodrugs for Targeted and Synergistic Chemo/photodynamic/gas Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) are constructed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6). BNN6@GBTC NPs possess good stability, ROS responsiveness, and selective HepG2 cells targetability via overexpressed galactose receptors on the cell membrane. When BNN6@GBTC NPs are taken up by HepG2 cells, they can generate ROS upon light irradiation, which can not only be used for photodynamic therapy, but also cleave the thioketal linkage to release camptothecin for chemotherapy. Meanwhile, BNN6 triggering release NO for gas therapy. BNN6@GBTC NPs enable targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy, which results in reduced damage to normal cells and enhanced anti&#8208;cancer efficacy in vitro. This work provides a novel approach for the design of nanoprodrugs based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to achieve the multimodal synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Chain&#8208;like Pentanuclear Complexes: Syntheses, Crystal Structures and Long&#8208;range Electronic Interactions of Cyanido&#8208;Bridged M2Ru3 (M = Fe, Ru)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the design and synthesis of two chain&#8208;like pentanuclear cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)2][cis&#8208;Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;NC)M(dppe)Cp*]2[PF6]4(M = Fe, 14+; M = Ru, 24+) and the electronic communication properties of their oxidized products 1m+ (m = 6, 7, 8) and 2n+ (n = 5, 6, 7, 8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis&#160;of 1m+ (m = 4, 6, 7) and 24+ show that 14+ and 24+ possess a Z&#8208;type array structure, 17+ is a U&#8208;type one, and 16+ exhibits both the types. The investigations indicate that both 1 and 2 show an extraordinarily strong electronic interaction between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8208;Ru&#8208;CN, leading to the formation of a fully delocalized cyanidometal Ru&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ru bridge for both three&#8208;electron oxidized states 17+ and 27+. Moreover, it should be noted that in 1 there exists no electronic interaction between the two terminal Fe ions. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits an electronic interaction between the two terminal metal ions across the trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Ru&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC bridge which is up to 20 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Complex as a Pre&#8208;Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the Fc effector functions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we present a novel pre&#8208;targeting approach that integrates host&#8208;guest chemistry with an antibody&#8208;recruiting concept to create mAbs with superior effector functions. Using rituximab (RTX), a clinically approved anti&#8208;CD20 mAb, as our model, we modified RTX by conjugating it with adamantane (Ada) derivatives and various polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to produce RTX&#8208;Ada conjugates. These conjugates effectively formed RTX&#8208;rhamnose (Rha) complexes in situ through self&#8208;assembly, driven by host&#8208;guest interactions with Rha&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This mechanism successfully redirected endogenous anti&#8208;Rha antibodies to target cells, enhancing the availability of Fc domains for improved effector functions, including complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). A structure&#8208;activity relationship study indicated that the potency of these in situ complexes was significantly influenced by the length of the PEG linker used; shorter PEG linkers correlated with higher CDC activity. Given the variability in endogenous antibody levels among individuals, this strategy presents a flexible and promising platform for enhancing the efficacy of mAb&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Site&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Aziridination of Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Palladium/Copper/Iodide/Oxygen Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylaziridines are important building blocks in organic chemistry, especially in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles. The direct and efficient transfer of an appropriate nitrogen source to readily accessible conjugated dienes is a notable methodology. The Pd&#8208;catalyzed oxidative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes through a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species should be an ideal method for the selective synthesis of vinylaziridines. However, this method faces the challenge of regioselectivity, often resulting in 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization instead. In this study, we developed a Pd&#8208;catalyzed aerobic 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of conjugated dienes via a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;palladium species to achieve regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective aziridination under the synergistic effects of Pd(II), Cu(I), I&#8208;, and O2. The &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium species formed in the system undergoes an unusual iodination process, leading to the formation of an allyl iodide intermediate. Subsequently, the vinylaziridine is obtained through intramolecular SN2' substitution of the allyl iodide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular chirality is the major branch of supramolecular chemistry, which not only plays important roles in biological processes but also in synthetically designed aggregated systems. &#160;To understand the complex processing of biological systems, the only way is to design supramolecular chiral ensembles that mimic natural biomolecules such as Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), Ribonucleic acid (RNA), amino acids, etc.&#160; In addition, chiral systems and self&#8208;assemblies as molecular motifs with breaking spatial inversion symmetry have been regarded as key substances in electronics and spintronics as well as in fundamental chemistry and physics. Here, in this review, our major concern is understanding modulation in spatial arrangements and packing modes under the impact of any external stimuli, which results in tailoring the handedness of resulted supramolecular chiral superstructures. We, in this review, highlighted the role of external stimuli such as solvent, chemical additives, photo exposure, etc. in altering the supramolecular chirality for their future utility as &#8220;active switches&#8221; in optoelectronic and spintronic devices and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Construction of Perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948;/CoRu Nanoparticles with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C Composite Enabling Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential components of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. In this study, we synthesized a Pr0.5Ba0.5Mn0.8Co0.1Ru0.1O2.5+&#948; (PBMCRO) perovskite composite with in situ exsolved CoRu nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C, functioning as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc&#8208;air batteries. The in situ exsolution of CoRu nanoparticles from the perovskite oxide was facilitated by the reducing action of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM). Concurrently, Co&#8211;N&#8211;C was used to decorate PBMCRO, forming a novel bifunctional composite electrode of Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO. The incorporation of CoRu nanoparticles introduces a significant number of electrochemically active oxygen vacancies in the perovskite matrix, enhancing ORR and OER performance. Additionally, the Co&#8211;N&#8211;C synergistically improves electrochemical activity while preserving the structural stability of the perovskite oxide. The prepared Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced bifunctional performance compared to the undecorated pristine perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3&#8211;&#948; (PBMO). The zinc&#8208;air battery with Co&#8211;N&#8211;C&#8211;PBMCRO catalyst achieve a peak power density of approximately 90 mW/cm2 and exhibit remarkable cycling stability for 788 h. This study presents a novel and effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of perovskite&#8208;based air electrodes for rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>
