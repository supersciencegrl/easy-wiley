         <title>Chiral Resolution of Spin&#8208;Crossover Active Iron(II) [2x2] Grid Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral magnetic materials are proposed for applications in second&#8208;order non&#8208;linear optics, magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism, among others. Recently, we have reported a set of tetra&#8208;nuclear Fe(II) grid complex conformers with general formula C/S&#8208;[Fe  4  L  4  ]  8+  (L: 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole). In the grid complexes, isomerism emerges from tautomerism and conformational isomerism of the ligand L, and the S&#8208;type grid complex is chiral, which originates from different non&#8208;centrosymmetric spatial organization of the trans type ligand around the Fe(II) center. However, the selective preparation of an enantiomerically pure grid complex in a controlled manner is difficult due to spontaneous self&#8208;assembly. To achieve the pre&#8208;synthesis programmable resolution of Fe(II) grid complexes, we designed and synthesized two novel intrinsically chiral ligands by appending chiral moieties to the parent ligand. The complexation of these chiral ligands with Fe(II) salt resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure Fe(II) grid complexes, as unambiguously elucidated by CD and XRD studies. The enantiomeric complexes exhibited similar gradual and half&#8208;complete thermal and photo&#8208;induced SCO characteristics. The good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated CD spectra further supports the enantiomeric purity of the complexes and even the magnetic studies. The chiral resolution of Fe(II)&#8208; [2x2] grid complexes reported in this study, for the first time, might enable the fabrication of magneto&#8208;chiral molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetallation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetallation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8211;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. Using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI  2  (IMe)  4  ] (Ln = Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] (M = Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetallation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI  2  (IMes)(THF)  3  ] while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI  2  (THF)  4  ] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI  2  (IMe)  4  ]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both complexes are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnesium Deintercalation From the Spinel&#8208;Type MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 (0.4 &lt; y &lt; 2.0) by Acid&#8208;Treatment and Electrochemistry</title>

         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium battery attracts lots of attention because of its high safety and low cost compared to lithium battery, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn  2  O  4  is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  . The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn  3+  (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe  3+  (non Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Promotion of Proton Conductivity by Encapsulation Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra in Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successively to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has the size of  ca.  20 &#197; (diameter), lager than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14 &#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7 &#197;), which makes that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOFs&#8217; cavities. The incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  S cm  &#8208;1  (at 80&#176;C under 98% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#204;DUT&#8208;68 which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 are more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;helical array of the aromatic oligoamide sequences can be switched from the antiparallel to parallel pattern through the transformation of thiol to disulfide. This enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias.







Abstract
A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the P/M bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This change enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness&#8208;mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single-crystal X-ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This change enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness-mediated process can be governed by the oxidation-reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head-to-head structural motif.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido&#8208;Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8722; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of isomorphous lanthanide Gd to Er complexes containing the tetraimido sulfate ligand renders these compounds compelling to be investigated for their single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The displayed Dy dimer shows slow magnetic relaxation at zero field. The monomeric Tb and Dy complexes show field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The ligand holds great potential for higher blocking systems, that is, removal of chloride ions, lithium transmetalation and promotion of the magnetic communication between the metal ions.







Abstract
Lanthanide ions are particularly well&#8208;suited for the design of single&#8208;molecule magnets owing to their large unquenched orbital angular momentum and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling that gives rise to high magnetic anisotropy. Such nanoscopic bar magnets can potentially revolutionize high&#8208;density information storage and processing technologies, if blocking temperatures can be increased substantially. Exploring non&#8208;classical ligand scaffolds with the aim to boost the barriers to spin&#8208;relaxation are prerequisite. Here, the synthesis, crystallographic and magnetic characterization of a series of each isomorphous mono&#8208; and dinuclear lanthanide (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) complexes comprising tetraimido sulfate ligands are presented. The dinuclear Dy complex [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2DyCl2}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClLi(thf)2] (1c) shows true signatures of single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior in the absence of a dc field. In addition, the mononuclear Dy and Tb complexes [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2LnCl2(thf)2] (2b,c) show slow magnetic relaxation under applied dc fields.

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol Derivatives and the Lewis Amphoteric Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate Anion, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species are virtually unknown, the oxidation of tris(pentafluoroethyl)silane, Si(C2F5)3H, with NO2 yielding tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol 1 which readily condenses to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane is reported. Deprotonation of in&#8197;situ generated Si(C2F5)3OH leads to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate 3 showing the Lewis amphoteric character of [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;.







Abstract
While alkyl&#8208;substituted siloxanes are widely known, virtually nothing is known about perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species, the silanols and silanolates. We recently reported on the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide ion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, which features Lewis amphoteric character deriving from the pentafluoroethyl substituents and their strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Transferring this knowledge, we investigated the Lewis amphoteric behavior of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;. In order to examine such Lewis amphoteric behavior, we first developed a strategy for the synthesis of the corresponding silanol Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses at room temperature to the hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane, (C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3. Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3OH employing a sterically demanding phosphazene base allows the characterization of the first example of a dimeric triorganosilanolate: the dianionic hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate, [{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722;, implies Lewis amphoteric character of the monomeric [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722; anion.

         <title>PorphyStruct: A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supersaddled copper corroles are a result of structural investigations towards non&#8208;planar distortion modes of porphyrinoids performed by the new digital tool PorphyStruct. The program introduces the technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter.







Abstract
PorphyStruct, a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in&#8208;depths discussions of structure&#8208;function correlations.

         <title>Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Semi&#8208;flexible Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Low Frequency and Small Amplitude Mechanical Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six types of polyoxometalates (POMs) with different structures and compositions are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs can promote the transfer of electrons from semiconductors to metals, laying a foundation for the application of POMs in a new field. and providing a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is essential for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Many organic polymer friction materials used widely have thermal stability problems, which makes TENGs with semiconductors as friction materials stand out. Here, we report a semi&#8208;flexible TENG based on metal and TiO2 modified by polyoxometalates (POMs) as pure inorganic friction materials. Six different POMs are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of TENGs, and the output performance of TENGs with different POMs&#8208;modified semiconductors and different metals as friction materials are tested. Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the optimal Ag&#8208;K6P2Mo18O62(P2Mo18)/TiO2 TENG device is increased by more than 4 times, which is mainly attributed to the strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs. This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.

         <title>BODIPYs with Photoactivatable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivatable BODIPYs permit fluorescence switching with spatiotemporal control under the influence of optical stimulations. Their synthetic versatility further provides the opportunity to engineer the photochemical, photophysical and structural properties for the implementation of invaluable imaging strategies aimed at elucidating the structures and dynamics of biological samples. Specifically, these photoactivatable fluorophores allow the visualization of live cells with sub&#8208;diffraction resolution and the monitoring of dynamic events in live organisms.







Abstract
The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, but efficient: Inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the tBu2S ligand is exploited to obtain molecular precursors that decompose at low&#8208; or even room temperature to afford metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. Easily extendable to other systems, this strategy can be used to obtain metastable or compositionally complex nanomaterials with greater control and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to harsh conditions.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(tBu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(tBu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(tBu2S)] (3) (TFA=trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.&#8201;g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5, Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.

         <title>Relevance of &#960;&#8208;Backbonding for the Reactivity of Electrophilic Anions [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vibrational frequency of CO, which binds to different electrophilic anions [B12X11]&#8208; (X=F, Cl, Br, I), is determined by an interplay of blue&#8208;shifting electrostatics (blue beam between boron and carbon) and red shifting &#960;&#8208;backdonation (flames). For X=Cl, Br, I, (upper half) electrostatics dominates, while for X=F (bottom) &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates and binds CO exceptionally strongly. Measured spectra are shown on the right. The band of unbound CO would be found at the position of the laser beam. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Mayer, J. Warneke, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100949).

         <title>Early Oxidative Transformations During the Biosynthesis of Terrein and Related Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterologous expression of two related biosynthetic gene clusters from Aspergillus terreus and Roussoella sp. DLM33 confirmed a conserved flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase that initiates the oxidative decarboxylation of the key intermediate (dichloro&#8208;) 6&#8208;hydroxymellein. Further in&#8197;vitro studies imply that both pathways diverge after this initial oxidation, whereas additional dehydration appears essential for downstream processing.







Abstract
The mycotoxin terrein is derived from the C10&#8208;precursor 6&#8208;hydroxymellein (6&#8208;HM) via an oxidative ring contraction. Although the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) has been identified, details of the enzymatic oxidative transformations are lacking. Combining heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro studies we show that the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase (FMO) TerC catalyzes the initial oxidative decarboxylation of 6&#8208;HM. The reactive intermediate is further hydroxylated by the second FMO TerD to yield a highly oxygenated aromatic species, but further reconstitution of the pathway was hampered. A related BGC was identified in the marine&#8208;derived Roussoella sp. DLM33 and confirmed by heterologous expression. These studies demonstrate that the biosynthetic pathways of terrein and related (polychlorinated) congeners diverge after oxidative decarboxylation of the lactone precursor that is catalyzed by a conserved FMO and further indicate that early dehydration of the side chain is an essential step.

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of a&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;-synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL-III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of a-synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti-aggregation activity of LL-III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial-type peptides with liquid condensates such as a-synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activity in ethylene polymerization with single&#8208;site organochromium complexes increases with number and donor strength of substituents. The new systems allow the formation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene with highest productivity and high co&#8208;monomer incorporation. An almost linear correlation between ligand donor strength and polymerization activity is observed.







Abstract
The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the para&#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal centre without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron&#8208;rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomers is also very high.

         <dc:description>
In an alternative approach to metal&#8208;containing cage assemblies, air&#8208;stable di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetranuclear organotin compounds were explored in a combined experimental and theoretical approach for the synthesis of hexa&#8208; and octanuclear metal cages based on halide&#8208;oxide (hydrolysis) reactions at the metal centres. Among these, there are two novel bis(tetraorganodistannoxanes) showing double&#8208;ladder&#8208;type structures with record of head&#8208;to&#8208;toe dimensions.

Abstract
Hydrolysis reactions of di&#8208; and trinuclear organotin halides yielded large novel cage compounds containing Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Sn bridges. The molecular structures of two octanuclear tetraorganodistannoxanes showing double&#8208;ladder motifs, viz., [{Me3SiCH2(Cl)SnCH2YCH2Sn(OH)CH2SiMe3}2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]2 [1, Y=p&#8208;(Me)2SiC6H4&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2] and [{Me3SiCH2(I)SnCH2YCH2Sn(OH)CH2SiMe3}2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2 [2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2, Y=p&#8208;(Me)2SiC6H4&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2], and the hexanuclear cage&#8208;compound 1,3,6&#8208;C6H3(p&#8208;C6H4Si(Me)2CH2Sn(R)2OSn(R)2CH2Si(Me)2C6H4&#8208;p)3C6H3&#8208;1,3,6 (3, R=CH2SiMe3) are reported. Of these, the co&#8208;crystal 2&#8901;0.48&#8201;I2 exhibits the largest spacing of 16.7&#8197;&#197; reported to date for distannoxane&#8208;based double ladders. DFT calculations for the hexanuclear cage and a related octanuclear congener accompany the experimental work.

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Electrophilic Fluorinating Reagents for Highly Selective Mono&#8208; and Difluorination of Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents [N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) analogues] were synthesized by using F2 gas. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers. Reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination.







Abstract
Efficient methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds have been intensively studied, recently. Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is, difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base&#8208;free conditions. Thus, both mono&#8208; and difluorinated target materials were prepared from the same substrate.

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which may lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, we developed a light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into achieve selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus to induce the thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. We also demonstrate the Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo, which can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control cytotoxicity activation at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>How Science Can Contribute to the Remedial Conservation of Cultural Heritage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our society needs resilience to stand against social and environmental challenges. Cultural heritage assets are crucial as they foster socio&#8208;economical improvements; however, they are threatened by degradation. We summarize here some of the most valuable solutions science has provided to systematically tackle degradation and re&#8208;valorize our cultural patrimony, overcoming the serendipitous approach of past conservation practices.







Abstract
Colloid science is contributing solutions to counteract the degradation of artifacts, favoring their transfer to future generations. Advanced materials such as nanoparticles, coatings, gels and microemulsions have been assessed in conservation, spanning from archeological sites to modern and contemporary art. We give an overview of the fundamental milestones and latest innovations in conservation science, targeting solutions and tools for remedial conservation based on green nanomaterials and hybrid systems. Future perspectives and outstanding challenges in this exciting field are then outlined.

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C &#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Redox Neutral Direct C&#8208;H Amination of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides with N&#8208;Acyloxyphthalimides</title>

         <dc:description>Abstract: Abstract

A room temperature, visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and redox neutral direct C&#8208;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance allow the preparation of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Several boron compounds with 2&#8208;(imidazo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols, differentiated by the nature of the substituent (R) in the para position of the hydroxy group, have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized both in solution (  1  H,  13  C,  11  B,  19  F NMR) and in the solid state (X&#8208;ray). All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations allowed to define the main electronic transitions as intra ligand transitions (  1  ILT), which was corroborated by the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) shapes. The homo&#8208;lumo energy gap was correlated to the electronic properties of the substituent R on the phenolic ring, as quantified by its &#963;  p  Hammett constant.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the application of  N  &#8208;heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB&#8208;donors in halogen&#8208;bond catalysis. They were benchmarked in seven diverse test reactions in which the activation of carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;chloride bonds as well as carbonyl and nitro groups was achieved.  N  &#8208;Methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB&#8208;donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF  3  .</dc:description>

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T  1  &#8208;weighted MR images.</dc:description>

         <title>"Zn bridge" Effect Toward Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristic For Volatile Random Access Memory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyimide memory materials with D&#8208;A structure based on charge transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next generation of information storage technology due to its outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance, well dimensional and chemical stability. It is one of core challenges in this field to precisely control memory performance by limited chemical decoration. Most of reported work mainly focus on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for expected memory behaviour of polyimides, which take a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we reported a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8208;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in central core of porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of charge transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8208;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance via only altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered cyclotides with potent broad in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to bioterrorism and rapid drug resistance development to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, we report the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity and provided protection in vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic d8&#8211;d10 Coupling of Rh(I) and M(0) (M=Pd, Pt) in a Sandwich Framework of p&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outside the norm: The low&#8208;valent heterometallic pair, d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt), undergoes unusual coupling through Rh&#8722;M bond formation in the sandwich framework of cycloheptatriene. The molecular orbital analysis showed that Rh&#8722;M d&#963; bond (M=Pd, Pt) is formed in a (d&#8211;d)18 electron system through the back&#8208;donating interaction.







Abstract
A heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond formation is a key to construct atomically precise bimetallic clusters and materials. However, it is sometimes not straightforward to construct a heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond through conventional methods including redox condensation. Here, we found that a sandwich framework of &#960;&#8208;conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands provides a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back&#8208;donation allows the formation of a d&#963;&#8208;type Rh&#8722;Pd bond in a (d&#8211;d)18 electron system.

         <title>Construction of Stable Helical Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Conformationally Rigid &#8220;Concave Ligand&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>
Concave concept: A helical metal&#8211;organic framework was prepared by using conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligands with binding units pointing toward each other. To avoid intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thus forming extended frameworks. With this new ligand design, a helical MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was prepared, thereby providing a new strategy for ligand design for the construction of porous materials.







Abstract
A helical metal&#8208;organic framework was prepared by using a conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligand with binding units pointing toward each other (concave ligand). To avoid the obvious intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thereby allowing the formation of extended frameworks for the first time. With this new ligand design, a helical&#8208;shaped MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was successfully prepared, thus providing a new strategy for ligand design toward porous material constructions.

         <title>Modulating the Acidic and Basic Site Concentration of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derivatives to Promote the Carbon Dioxide Epoxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCN&#8208;244&#8722;ZnCo1 was successfully synthesized and then pyrolyzed to the target product PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The physical structure of PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 did not change much, as judged by SEM and N2 adsorption and desorption. Due to the volatilization of Zn, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/alkaline site concentration compared to the precursor. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) is an ideal precursor/template for porous carbon, and its active components are uniformly doped, which can be used in energy storage and catalytic conversion fields. Metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224 with carboxylporphyrin as the ligand was synthesized, and then Zn2+ and Co2+ ions were coordinated in the center of the porphyrin ring by post&#8208;modification. Here, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo with different ratios of bimetallic Zn2+/Co2+ ions were used as the precursor, and the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon(M&#8722;N&#8722;C) material of PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo&#8208;950 was obtained by pyrolyzing the precursor at 950&#8201;&#176;C in Ar. Because Zn is easy to volatilize at 950&#8201;&#176;C, the formed M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials can reflect different Co contents and different basic site concentrations. The formed material still maintains the original basic framework. With the increase of Zn2+/Co2+ ratio in precursor, the concentration of N&#8208;containing alkaline sites in pyrolysis products gradually increase. Compared with the precursor, PCN&#8208;224&#8722;ZnCo1&#8208;950 with Zn2+/Co2+=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/ alkaline site concentration. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide. More importantly, the current method of adjusting the acidic/basic sites in M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials through volatilization of volatile metals can provide an effective strategy for adjusting the catalysis of MOF derivatives with porphyrin structure.

The physical structure of PCN-224&#8722;ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-950 did not change much, as judged by SEM and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and desorption. Due to the volatilization of Zn, PCN-224&#8722;ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-950 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/alkaline site concentration compared to the precursor. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with epoxides.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic framework (MOF) is an ideal precursor/template for porous carbon, and its active components are uniformly doped, which can be used in energy storage and catalytic conversion fields. Metal-organic framework PCN-224 with carboxylporphyrin as the ligand was synthesized, and then Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were coordinated in the center of the porphyrin ring by post-modification. Here, PCN-224&#8722;ZnCo with different ratios of bimetallic Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were used as the precursor, and the metal-nitrogen-carbon(M&#8722;N&#8722;C) material of PCN-224&#8722;ZnCo-950 was obtained by pyrolyzing the precursor at 950&#8201;&#176;C in Ar. Because Zn is easy to volatilize at 950&#8201;&#176;C, the formed M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials can reflect different Co contents and different basic site concentrations. The formed material still maintains the original basic framework. With the increase of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio in precursor, the concentration of N-containing alkaline sites in pyrolysis products gradually increase. Compared with the precursor, PCN-224&#8722;ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-950 with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 has greatly improved basicity and suitable acidic/ alkaline site concentration. It can be efficiently used to carbon dioxide absorption and catalyze the cycloaddition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with epoxide. More importantly, the current method of adjusting the acidic/basic sites in M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials through volatilization of volatile metals can provide an effective strategy for adjusting the catalysis of MOF derivatives with porphyrin structure.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilisation of [WVF4]+ by N&#8208; and P&#8208;Donor Ligands: Second&#8208;Order Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in Octacoordinate d1 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [WVF4]+ cation has been stabilised by C5H5N and P(CH3)3 in [O3SCF3]&#8722; salts. The cations adopt square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries in the solid state, instead of trigonal dodecahedra (TD), as determined using a new geometry index, &#964;8, to discern octacoordinate geometries. This preference for SA was revealed by DFT (B3LYP) studies to arise from a favourable second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion upon occupation of the 
 orbital on tungsten.







Abstract
The first isolated examples of cationic fluoridotungsten(V) complexes are reported as octacoordinate [WF4(L)4]+ (L=C5H5N, P(CH3)3). The [WF4(NC5H5)4]+ cation is synthesised as its [O3SCF3]&#8722; salt upon reaction of WF5(NC5H5)2 with [(CH3)3Si(NC5H5)][O3SCF3] in excess C5H5N, whereas [WF4{P(CH3)3}4]+ is accessed directly from WF6 upon reaction with (CH3)3SiO3SCF3 and excess P(CH3)3. These salts were characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state. New geometry indices for octacoordinate complexes (&#964;8 and &#964;8&#8242;) are introduced, allowing for the facile differentiation of trigonal&#8208;dodecahedral (TD) and square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries. This has disambiguated the SA geometries of [WF4(L)4]+ and the geometries of a series of previously reported d0 and d1 MA4B4 complexes. Computational (DFT&#8722;B3LYP) studies of [WF4(PH3)4]2+/+ and related model systems demonstrate the occurrence of a second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller (SOJT) distortion from TD in d0 complexes to SA in d1 complexes, with the degree of SOJT stabilisation being most significant in 5d complexes containing fluorido ligands and monodentate neutral donors.

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions show a remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8208;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tunning its reactivity. Here, we describe the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions. We use DFT&#8208;derived parameters for capturing their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic carbon, the number of &#945;&#8208;boryl motifs, and the metal counteraction. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata&#8208;alkene species with C&#8208;B &#960; interaction polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, we can classify the &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1) nucleophilic borata&#8208;alkene salts with alkali and alkali&#8208;earth metals, 2) nucleophilic &#951;  2  &#8208;(C&#8208;B) borata&#8208;alkene complexes with early transition metals, Cu and Ag, and 3) &#945;&#8208;boryl alkyl complexes with late transition metals. This trend map aids the selection of the appropriate reactive synthon depending on the sought reactivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the  N  &#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example on the direct C&#8208;6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8208;H group.</dc:description>

Catalytic amounts of coordinating additives to labilize the platinum-pyridyl bond to some extent, are needed to selectively form Pt&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;12&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;24&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;assemblies. The formed Pt&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;12&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;24&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;nanospheres were demonstrated to be stable in presence of chloride, amines and acids, unlike the palladium analogues.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/italic&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span lang="EN-GB"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;o:p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/o:p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Access of Ternary Organotetrel&#8208;Copper Chalcogenide Clusters by [PhTE3]3&#8722; Anions (T=Si, Sn; E=S, Se)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clusters of the type [(CuPPh2Ph)6(PhTE3)2] (T=Si, Sn; E=S, Se) and [(CuPPh3)6(PhSnSe3)3Cu3SnSe] were formed in reactions of Na3[PhTE3] with [Cu(PPh3)3Cl]. The larger cluster based on T/E=Sn/Se clearly followed upon partial degradation of the [PhSnSe3]3&#8722; subunit and exhibited a new cluster archetype with idealized C3v symmetry. Quantum chemical studies served to shed light on the bonding situation in these clusters and to rationalize the optical absorption properties measured by solid&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption spectra.







Abstract
Fragmentation reactions of organotetrel chalcogenide heteroadamantane&#8208;type clusters [(PhT)4E6] (T/E=Si/S (1); Si/Se; Sn/S, and Sn/Se) by addition of the corresponding sodium chalcogenide gave salts of the general formula Na3[PhTE3], with T/E=Si/S (2); Si/Se (3); Sn/S (A); Sn/Se (4). Reaction of these salts with [Cu(PPh3)3Cl] gave a series of organotetrel&#8211;copper chalcogenide clusters [(CuPPh3)6(PhTE3)2] with T/E=Si/S; (5), Si/Se (6), Sn/S (7) and Sn/Se (8). Compounds 5&#8211;8 share a common structural motif with two intact {PhTE3} units coordinating a Cu6 moiety, which was previously reported with other ligands, and for the Sn and Ge congeners only. If the Sn/Se reaction system was allowed to crystallize more slowly, single crystals of compound [(CuPPh3)6(PhSnSe3)3Cu3SnSe] (9) were obtained, which are based on a larger cluster structure. Hence, 9 might form from 8 through incorporation of additional cluster fragments. The experimentally and quantum chemically determined optical properties were compared to related clusters.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Initiated Cobalt Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Outer&#8208;sphere radical hydrogenation of olefins proceeds via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from transition metal hydride species to the substrate. Typical catalysts exhibit M&#8211;H bonds that are either too weak to efficiently activate H  2  &#160;or too strong to reduce unactivated olefins. This contribution evaluates an alternative approach, that starts from a square&#8208;planar cobalt(II) hydride complex. Photoactivation results in Co&#8211;H bond homolysis. The three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) photoproduct binds H  2  &#160;to give a dihydrogen complex, which is a strong hydrogen atom donor, enabling the stepwise hydrogenation of both styrenes and unactivated aliphatic olefins with H  2  &#160;via HAT.</dc:description>

Under gentle heating conditions in NaOAc/AcOH, brominated lactol silyl ethers were selectively converted to 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoates &#8208; a naphthalene scaffold with a fully substituted benzene unit. The present reaction including a 1,2&#8208;aryl migration process was successfully applied to construct a wide range of polycyclic systems including biphenyl, anthracene, and benzothiophene structures. In addition, the 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoate products showed bright photoluminescence emmission from solid&#8208;state as well as in several organic solvents.

4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoates having the less accessible 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphthalene scaffold and that show photoluminescence emission from solid state as well as in solutions, were selectively synthesized from brominated lactol silyl ethers through the 1,2&#8208;aryl&#8208;migrative ring rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Preparation of Butadienylpyridines by Iridium&#8208;NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydroalkenylation and Quinolizine Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magic watchmaker. The Ir&#8208;NHC catalyst efficiently hydroalkenylates alkynes with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine. The interplay of the NHC and acac ligands drives the reaction via IrIII intermediates allowing the selective formation of expected and unexpected butadienylpyridine derivatives. The unusual 5&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;butadienylpyridines result from a complex stepwise mechanism involving quinolizine intermediates.







Abstract
Iridium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of formula Ir(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(IPr)(&#951;2&#8208;coe) [BHetA=bis&#8208;heteroatomic acidato, acetylacetonate or acetate; IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;carbene; coe=cyclooctene] have been prepared by treating Ir(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(&#951;2&#8208;coe)2 complexes with IPr. These complexes react with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine to afford the hydrido&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;alkenyl cyclometalated derivatives IrH(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(&#954;2N,C&#8208;C7H6N)(IPr) through the iridium(I) intermediate Ir(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;BHetA)(IPr)(&#951;2&#8208;C7H7N). The cyclometalated IrH(&#954;2O,O&#8217;&#8208;acac)(&#954;2N,C&#8211;C7H6N)(IPr) complex efficiently catalyzes the hydroalkenylation of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes and enynes with 2&#8208;vinylpyridine to afford 2&#8208;(4R&#8208;butadienyl)pyridines with Z,E configuration as the major reaction products (yield up to 89&#8201;%). In addition, unprecedented (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butadienyl&#8208;5R&#8208;pyridine derivatives have been obtained as minor reaction products (yield up to 21&#8201;%) from the elusive 1Z,3gem&#8208;butadienyl hydroalkenylation products. These compounds undergo a thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization to afford bicyclic 4H&#8208;quinolizine derivatives that, under catalytic reaction conditions, tautomerize to 6H&#8208;quinolizine to afford the (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(butadienyl)&#8208;5R&#8208;pyridine by a retro&#8208;electrocyclization reaction.

         <title>Easy Access to Versatile Catalytic Systems for C&#8722;H Activation and Reductive Amination Based on Tetrahydrofluorenyl Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile rhodium catalystfor the formation C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds was synthesized based on easily available 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorene. The catalyst efficiently works for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds via elimination of the tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand as well as for CH activation of aromatic compounds with the retention of this ligand.







Abstract
On the basis of the 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand, a simple approach was developed to new effective rhodium catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. The halide compounds [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhX2]2 (2&#8201;a: X=Br; 2&#8201;b: X=I) were synthesized by treatment of the bis(ethylene) derivative (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(C2H4)2 (1&#8201;a) with halogens. An analogous reaction of the cyclooctadiene complex (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(cod) (1&#8201;b) with I2 is complicated by the side formation of [(cod)RhI]2. The reaction of 2&#8201;b with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl leads to cation [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)I]+ (3). The halide abstraction from 2&#8201;a,b with thallium or silver salts allowed us to prepare sandwich compounds with incoming cyclopentadienyl, dicarbollide and mesityleneligands [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhCp]+ (4), (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;7,8&#8208;C2B9H11) (5), and [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;mesitylene)]2+ (6). The structures of 1&#8201;b, 2&#8201;b&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I2, 3PF6, 4TlI4, 5, and [(cod)RhI]2 were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds 2&#8201;a,b efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with alkynes to selectively give isocoumarins or naphthalenes, depending on the reaction temperature. Moreover, they showed moderate catalytic activity in other annulations of alkynes with aromatic compounds (such as benzamide, acetanilide, etc.) which proceed through CH activation. Compound 2&#8201;b also effectively catalyzes the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones in the presence of carbon monoxide and water via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, giving amines in high yields (67&#8211;99&#8201;%).

         <title>Anthrathiadiazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Physical Properties and Two&#8208;photon Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, by using a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione, the substituted anthrathiadiazoles with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed. The as&#8208;obtained compounds display the two&#8208;photon absorption, where their cross&#8208;section values are strongly affected by the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups.







Abstract
Anthrathiadiazole is a key synthon for the construction of large azaacenes, however, the attachment of different substituents onto the skeleton of anthrathiadiazole is difficult but highly desirable because it could be easy to enrich the structures of azaacenes. Here, it is demonstrated that anthrathiadiazole derivatives with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed through a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione. The structures of the as&#8208;prepared compounds with different substituents were carefully characterized. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the as&#8208;prepared anthrathiadiazole derivatives were fully investigated, where the cyano&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;CN) has the highest stability and the methoxy&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;OCH3) is easy to be oxidized. Moreover, the two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) characteristics of different anthrathiadiazoles are also studied by using the femtosecond Z&#8208;scan technique. The results show that the fused anthrathiadiazole skeletons possess large TPA cross&#8208;section values &#948;2 in the range of 3000&#8211;5000&#8197;GM, where the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups have strong effect on these values.

         <title>Indium Tribromide&#8208;Catalysed Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation: Expanding the Scope of the Hydrogenation and of the Regiodivergent DH or HD Addition to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More is better: The InBr3&#8208;catalysed transfer&#8208;hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds to di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes was realised utilising cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene as H2 surrogate in chlorinated solvents, such as DCM and DCE. The scope of the reactions could be expanded towards electron&#8208;deficient aryl&#8208;substituted alkenes and even to a dialkyl&#8208;substituted alkene. The regiodivergent hydrodeuterogenation as well as the deuterohydrogenation were realised with two regiospecifically deuterium&#8208;labelled HD surrogates to access site selective deuterium incorporation in the products.







Abstract
The transfer&#8208;hydrogenation as well as the regioselective and regiodivergent addition of H&#8722;D from regiospecific deuterated dihydroaromatic compounds to a variety of 1,1&#8208;di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes was realised with InBr3 in dichloro(m)ethane. In comparison with the previously reported BF3&#8901;Et2O&#8208;catalysed process, electron&#8208;deficient aryl&#8208;substituents can be applied reliably and thereby several restrictions could be lifted, and new types of substrates could be transformed successfully in hydrodeuterogenation as well as deuterohydrogenation transfer&#8208;hydrogenation reactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dancing partners: &#8220;Snapshot&#8221; trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums in a halogen dance has been realized in a batch reactor. This method allows selective generation of isomeric azolylzinc species from a single starting material by using newly synthesized bench&#8208;stable zinc halide diamine complexes, leading to the divergent and stereoselective synthesis of functionalized azoles.

Recent developments in flow microreactor technology have allowed the use of transient organolithium compounds that cannot be realized in a batch reactor. However, trapping the transient aryllithiums in a &#8220;halogen dance&#8221; is still challenging. Herein is reported the trapping of such short&#8208;lived azolyllithiums in a batch reactor by developing a finely tuned in&#8197;situ zincation using zinc halide diamine complexes. The reaction rate is controlled by the appropriate choice of diamine ligand. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0&#8201;&#176;C with high reproducibility on a multigram scale. This method was applicable to a wide range of brominated azoles allowing deprotonative functionalization, which was used for the concise divergent syntheses of both constitutional isomers of biologically active azoles.

High&#8208;yield synthesis: A mild palladium&#8208;catalysed Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;diisopropylsilyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucal with various (hetero)aryl halides has been developed. This arylation strategy enables the synthesis of a variety of (hetero)aryl pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;glucosides in good to excellent yields. Without the need for protecting groups, selected pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;glucosides were stereoselectively converted into the corresponding C&#8208;glucosides, as well as 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glucosides. This methodology was applied to the efficient and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of dapagliflozin and its uncommon &#945;&#8208;isomer.

         <title>Rethinking Borole Cycloaddition Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New insights into the reactivity of perarylated boroles toward alkynes have been derived from both experimental and computational studies. It is shown that borepins (the formal alkyne insertion products) can readily isomerize to the thermodynamically more favorable boranorbornadienes (the formal Diels&#8208;Alder products), thus obscuring the mechanism of product formation (see Figure). In addition, the fluorescent nature of the tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers of the addition reactions, has been investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy.







Abstract
Boroles are attracting broad interest for their myriad and diverse applications, including in synthesis, small molecule activation and functional materials. Their properties and reactivity are closely linked to the cyclic conjugated diene system, which has been shown to participate in cycloaddition reactions, such as the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with alkynes. The reaction steps leading to boranorbornadienes, borepins and tricyclic boracyclohexenes from the thermal reaction of boroles with alkynes are seemingly well understood as judged from the literature. Herein, we question the long&#8208;established mechanistic picture of pericyclic rearrangements by demonstrating that seven&#8208;membered borepins (i.&#8201;e., heptaphenylborepin and two derivatives substituted with a thienyl and chloride substituent on boron) exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding bicyclic boranorbornadienes, the direct Diels&#8208;Alder products, but are not isolable products from the reactions. Heating gradually converts the isomeric mixtures into fluorescent tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers in the series. Results from mechanistic DFT calculations reveal that the tricyclic compounds derive from the boranorbornadienes and not the borepins, which were previously believed to be intermediates in purely pericyclic processes.

         <dc:description>A family of Pd8 chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L = none (1), solvents (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]&#173;(BF4)2 (4), were systematically synthesized by using 2a (L = CH3CN) as a good precursor. DFT calculations with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (D3) indicated that the formation energy of Pd8 chain from two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions with four sets of interligand C&#8211;H/p interactions and Pd&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared delocalized covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands, which are evidenced by the relationships between the NIR absorption energy and the distances of the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2]2+ (13), and their cyclic voltammograms demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+ &#8596; {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. Reactions of 2a with 1 eq. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, DOSY NMR spectra and SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers exist as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50 units of the Pd8 rod.</dc:description>

Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl&#8217;s nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423 K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative nucleosomal reactivity of 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;uridine and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;cytidine</title>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) are formyl&#8208;containing nucleosides that are created by oxidative stress in differentiated cells. While fdU is almost exclusively an oxidative stress lesion formed from deoxythymidine (T), the situation for fdC is more complex. Next to formation as an oxidative lesion, it is particularly abundant in stem cells, where it is more frequently formed in an epigenetically important oxidation reaction performed by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent TET enzymes from 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC). Recently, it was shown that genomic fdC and fdU can react with the &#949;&#8208;aminogroups of nucleosomal lysines to give Schiff base adducts that covalently link nucleosomes to genomic DNA. Here we show that fdU features a significantly higher reactivity towards lysine side chains compared with fdC. This result shows that depending on the amounts of fdC and fdU, oxidative stress may have a bigger impact on nucleosome binding than epigenetics.</dc:description>

         <title>A chiral lanthanide tag for stable and rigid attachment to single cysteine residues in proteins for NMR, EPR and time&#8208;resolved luminescence studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lanthanide&#8208;binding tag site&#8208;specifically attached to a protein presents a tool to probe the protein by multiple spectroscopic techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy experiments. Here we present a new stable chiral Ln(III) tag, referred to as C12, for spontaneous and quantitative reaction with a cysteine residue generating a stable thioether bond. The synthetic protocol of the tag is relatively straightforward and the tag is stable for storage and shipping. It displays greatly enhanced reactivity towards selenocysteine, opening a route towards selective tagging of selenocysteine in proteins containing cysteine residues. Loaded with Tb(III) or Tm(III) ions, the C12 tag readily generates pseudocontact shifts (PCS) in protein NMR spectra. It produces a relatively rigid tether between lanthanide and protein, which is beneficial for interpretation of the PCSs by single magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensors, and it is suitable for measuring distance distributions in double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments. Upon reaction with cysteine or other thiol compounds, the Tb(III) complex exhibits a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence quantum yield, affording a highly sensitive turn&#8208;on luminescence probe for time&#8208;resolved FRET assays and enzyme reaction monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>Distorted Porphyrins with High Stability: Synthesis and Characteristic Electronic Properties of Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Nuclear Tricarbonyl Rhenium Tetraazaporphyrin Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 8994-9002, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin (TAP: phthalocyanine (Pc) analogue) complexes were newly synthesized. The ReTAP complexes are structurally distorted, but are shown to be highly stable from the viewpoint of the tolerance toward oxidation and the demetallation in polar solvents. Also, the ReTAP complexes show unique broad Q bands, owing to the admixture of the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* and MLCT characters. The present study is useful for controlling electronic properties and realizing high stability in Pc analogues.







Abstract
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;nuclear tricarbonyl Re(I) tetraazaporphyrin complexes (Re1TAP and Re2TAP) are investigated and compared with Re(I) phthalocyanine complexes (Re1Pc and Re2Pc). Although Re2Pc is unstable in polar solvents, and easily undergoes demetallation reaction, the coordination of the TAP ligand significantly improves the tolerance toward polar solvents, affording more stability to Re2TAP. Additionally, the incorporation of [Re(CO)3]+ unit(s) and the TAP ligand results in remarkable positive shifts in both oxidation and reduction potentials. Consequently, the more positive oxidation potentials of the ReTAP complexes significantly increase the tolerance toward oxidation, while the reduction potential indicates that Re2TAP is suitable for a soluble electron acceptor. In contrast to Re1Pc and Re2Pc, Re1TAP and Re2TAP show unique broad Q bands, which can be attributed to the admixture of the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characters, owing to the lowered &#960; orbital energy in the TAP complexes. This study is useful for controlling electronic properties and realizing high stability in Pc analogues.

         <title>Using the Interaction between Copper and Manganese to Stabilize Copper Single&#8208;atom for CO Oxidation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9060-9070, June 21, 2021. </description>

Getting the SAC: Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts have been prepared by the metal&#8208;support interaction that forms the Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Mn entity. This not only stabilizes Cu single atoms, but also promotes CO oxidation by increasing active oxygen species and by the active center participating in the catalytic reaction. The catalyst can maintain CO conversion of 95&#8201;% after 15 cycles.







Abstract
The interaction between Cu and Mn has been used to immobilize the Cu single&#8208;atom on MnO2 surface by redox&#8208;driven hydrolysis. Comprehensive structure and property characterizations demonstrate that the existence of an Cu&#8722;Mn interaction on the catalyst surface can effectively restrain the aggregation of Cu single atoms and improve carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation activity. The interaction of forming the Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Mn entity is beneficial for CO catalytic activity as the migration of reactive oxygen species and the coordination effect of active centers accelerate the reaction. In particular, 3%&#8208;Cu1/MnO2 shows an oxygen storage capacity (OSC) value (342.75&#8197;&#956;mol/g) more than ten times that of pure MnO2 (27.79&#8197;&#956;mol/g) and has high CO catalytic activity (T90%=80&#8201;&#176;C), it can maintain CO conversion of 95&#8201;% after 15 cycles. This work offers a reliable method for synthesizing Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts and deepens understanding of the interaction effect between single transition metal atoms and supports that can improve the catalytic activity of CO oxidation.

The interaction of forming the Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Mn entity is beneficial for CO catalytic activity as the migration of reactive oxygen species and the coordination effect of active centers accelerate the reaction. In particular, 3%-Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows an oxygen storage capacity (OSC) value (342.75&#8197;&#956;mol/g) more than ten times that of pure MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (27.79&#8197;&#956;mol/g) and has high CO catalytic activity (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90%&lt;/sub&gt;=80&#8201;&#176;C), it can maintain CO conversion of 95&#8201;% after 15 cycles. This work offers a reliable method for synthesizing Cu single-atom catalysts and deepens understanding of the interaction effect between single transition metal atoms and supports that can improve the catalytic activity of CO oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Mesoporous Copper(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Remediation of Organic Dyes</title>

Clean water act: Copper(II) MOFs with linkers derived from 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridine have been synthesized, and their crystal structures have been determined. One of the MOFs was found to be mesoporous and highly active in the remediation of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, in which cationic dyes could be removed by adsorption while anionic dyes could be degraded by using the MOF as a catalyst under visible light.







Abstract
By using tritopic and ditopic organic linkers derived from the same 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridine core, copper(II) metal&#8208;organic frameworks with different three&#8208;dimensional structures have been successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. The crystalline framework, PTBMOF ([Cu3(PTB)2(H2O)3]n, where H3PTB=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzoic acid, was observed to be mesoporous in nature and exhibited dual functionality in the removal of organic dyes. While cationic dyes such as methylene blue and malachite green, which are of different sizes, were adsorbed by PTBMOF; anionic dyes such as tartrazine could be effectively degraded in a photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction catalyzed by the MOFs under irradiation with visible light.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Photoacidic Merocyanines in Aqueous Solution</title>

Transient absorption studies of protonated pyridine&#8208; and nitro&#8208;merocyanines reveal a pH&#8208;gated photoacidic behaviour. The O&#8208;protic site shows an ultrafast excited state super&#8208;photoacid reactivity at low pH values that is even capable of proton transfer to alcoholic solvents. Remarkably, the pyridine compound exhibits an additional N&#8208;protic site which functions as photoacid generator at pH&#8197;5.5 due to its lowered ground state pKa value after photoisomerization to the ring&#8208;closed spiropyran structure.







Abstract
Photoacids attract increasing scientific attention, as they are valuable tools to spatiotemporally control proton&#8208;release reactions and pH values of solutions. We present the first time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic study of the excited state and proton&#8208;release dynamics of prominent merocyanine representatives. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of a pyridine merocyanine with two distinct protonation sites revealed dissimilar proton&#8208;release mechanisms: one site acts as a photoacid generator as its pKa value is modulated in the ground state after photoisomerization, while the other functions as an excited state photoacid which releases its proton within 1.1&#8197;ps. With a pKa drop of 8.7&#8197;units to &#8722;5.5 upon excitation, the latter phenolic site is regarded a super&#8208;photoacid. The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the ortho&#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.

         <title>Acetylenic Replacement of Albicidin's Methacrylamide Residue Circumvents Detrimental E/Z Photoisomerization and Preserves Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9077-9086, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead optimization: The cinnamoyl residue of the antibiotic albicidin is shown to readily undergo UV&#8208;mediated E/Z isomerization, thereby converting from the highly bioactive E form found in the natural product to the significantly less bioactive Z form. Acetylenic replacement of the susceptible methylacrylamide moiety affords a set of photochemically stable albicidin derivatives with virtually undiminished antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The natural product albicidin is a highly potent inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase. Its outstanding activity, particularly against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens, qualifies it as a promising lead structure in the search for new antibacterial drugs. However, as we show here, the N&#8208;terminal cinnamoyl moiety of albicidin is susceptible to photochemical E/Z isomerization. Moreover, the newly formed Z isomer exhibits significantly reduced antibacterial activity, which hampers the development and biological evaluation of albicidin and potent derivatives thereof. Hence, we synthesized 13 different variants of albicidin in which the vulnerable para&#8208;coumaric acid moiety was replaced; this yielded photostable analogues. Biological activity assays revealed that diaryl alkyne analogues exhibited virtually undiminished antibacterial efficacy. This promising scaffold will therefore serve as a blueprint for the design of a potent albicidin&#8208;based drug.

         <title>Selectivity in the Ligand Functionalization of Photocatalytic Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phase Transfer and Self&#8208;Assembly Applications</title>

Transferred to film: The selectivity in ligand functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles namely has been demonstrated for thiol (dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol) and amine (oleylamine) terminated ligands. The success of polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar phase transfer of the nanoparticles is consistent with the ligand&#8208;nanoparticle selectivity. The hydrophobic functionalized nanoparticles can be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface for thin&#8208;film applications.







Abstract
The functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles of TiO2, ZnO, WO3 and CuO with amine&#8208;terminated (oleylamine) and thiol&#8208;terminated (dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol) alkyl&#8208;chain ligands was studied under ambient conditions. A high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds stably to only TiO2 and WO3, whereas dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol binds stably only to ZnO and CuO. Similarly, polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar solvent phase transfer of TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol, whereas the opposite holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface chemistry of ligand&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles was probed by attenuated total reflectance (ATR)&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy, which enabled the occupation of the ligands at the active sites to be elucidated. The photostability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface was determined by the photocatalytic self&#8208;cleaning properties of the material. Although TiO2 and WO3 degrade the ligands within 24&#8197;h under both UV and visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example, because the ligand&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they can be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface to give nanoparticle films with demonstrated photocatalytic as well as anti&#8208;fogging properties.

         <title>Redox Chemistry of Heterobimetallic Polypnictogen Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes &#8211; Rearrangement, Fragmentation and Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9129-9140, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox chemistry of heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes (Fe/Co and Co/Ni) with polypnictogen ligands (E=P, As) was studied first by cyclic voltammetry and then experimentally. The complexes respond to the addition and withdrawal of electrons either by the rearrangement of the triple&#8208;decker geometry, by the fragmentation of the En ligand and/or by the exchange of {Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;M} fragments.







Abstract
The redox chemistry of the heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;4&#8208;E5)] (E=P (1), As (2), Cp*=1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) and [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (10), As (11)) was investigated. Compound 1 and 2 could be oxidized to the monocations 3 and 4 and further to the dications 5 and 6, while the initially folded cyclo&#8208;E5 ligand planarizes upon oxidation. The reduction leads to an opposite change in the geometry of the middle deck, which is now folded stronger into the direction of the other metal fragment (formation of monoanions 7 and 8). For the arsenic compound 8, a different behavior is found since a fragmentation into an As6 (9) and As3 ligand complex occurs. The Co and Ni triple&#8208;decker complexes 10 and 11 can be oxidized initially to the heterometallic monocations 12 and 13, which are not stable in solution and convert selectively into the homometallic nickel complexes 14 and 15 and the cobalt complexes 16 and 17. This behavior was further proven by the oxidation of [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;2&#8208;P3)] (19, Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) comprising two different Cp ligands. The transfer of {CpRM} fragments can be suppressed when a {W(CO)5} unit is coordinated to the P3 ligand (20) prior to the oxidation and the mixed cobalt and nickel cation 21 can be isolated. The reduction of 10 and 11 yields the heterometallic monoanions 22 and 23, where no transfer of the {CpRM} fragments is observed.

         <title>Cerium Doping Double Perovskite Scintillator for Sensitive X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9071-9076, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cerium&#8208;ion doped lead&#8208;free double perovskite crystals (Cs2NaTbCl6), were found to have significantly improved sensitivity and the double perovskite crystals (Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6) showed excellent ability to resist X&#8208;ray radiation damage. In addition the composite film of Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6 crystals can reach a detection limit of 30&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 of X&#8208;ray detector, with the capability to clearly distinguishing the spatial resolution of 10&#8197;lp/mm.







Abstract
Scintillators are widely used for nondestructive testing, nuclear medicine imaging, space exploration and security inspection. Recently, lead halide perovskite scintillation crystals have been brought into focus due to their effective atomic number, fast scintillation decay time, strong luminous efficiency, and tunable band gap. However, their application is limited by lead toxicity. Here we report that Ce&#8208;doping can increase sensitivity in lead&#8208;free double perovskite crystals (Cs2NaTbCl6) for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. The introduction of Ce ions as sensitizer can be used to improve the radioluminescence of the crystals. The light output of Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6 crystals is about 52153&#8197;ph/MeV, which is 25&#8201;% higher than that of un&#8208;doped crystal. The X&#8208;ray sensitivity is significantly enhanced. Based on our scintillation film X&#8208;ray detector the detection limit is 30&#8197;nGy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is about 1/183 of the typical medical imaging dose. Our scintillating film has excellent imaging ability with spatial resolution of up to 10&#8197;lp/mm. This research shows that Ce&#8201;:&#8201;Cs2NaTbCl6 perovskite crystal scintillators are promising materials for X&#8208;ray imaging application.

         <title>A Smart Access to the Dinitramide Anion &#8211; The Use of Dinitraminic Acid for the Preparation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Energetic Copper(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9112-9123, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dinitramide anion was made accessible for complexation through the use of dinitraminic acid and basic copper(II) carbonate. The in&#8197;situ prepared copper dinitramide was complexed by 13 different highly endothermic tri&#8208; and tetrazole ligands. By the choice of ligand, complexes were obtained that possess thermal stability exceeding 200&#8197;degrees Celsius, one even capable of initiating pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The examined compounds were successfully ignited in laser experiments, with one complex even detonating.







Abstract
Dinitraminic acid (HN(NO2)2, HDN) was prepared by ion exchange chromatography and acid&#8208;base reaction with basic copper(II) carbonate allowed the in&#8197;situ preparation of copper(II) dinitramide, which was reacted with twelve nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, for example, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole, di(5H&#8208;tetrazolyl)&#8208;methane/&#8208;ethane/&#8208;propane/&#8208;butane. Nine of the complexes were investigated by low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, all compounds were investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for selected compounds. Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)4(H2O)](DN)2, based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of initiating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#8197;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded to apprehend the ignition mechanism.

         <title>Hollow POM@MOF&#8208;derived Porous NiMo6@Co3O4 for Biothiol Colorimetric Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9141-9151, June 21, 2021. </description>

NiMo6@ZIF&#8208;67 derived hollow porous Co3O4 with tetrahedral sites (with four oxygen neighbours) and octahedral sites (with six oxygen neighbours) were prepared. Compared with pure porous and commercial Co3O4, NiMo6@Co3O4(n) exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity and stability, and the corresponding &#8216;on&#8208;off switch&#8217; colorimetric biosensing platform with the inspiring sensitivity and terrific selectivity for L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) detection has been developed to date.







Abstract
Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co3O4 composite (NiMo6@Co3O4) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co3O4, NiMo6@Co3O4(n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co3O4 and multi&#8208;electron NiMo6 clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo6@Co3O4(n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo6, and the optimized NiMo6@Co3O4(2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive L&#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023&#8197;&#956;M&#8722;1 and the detection limit at least 0.018&#8197;&#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.

         <title>Trends in Conjugated Chalcogenophenes: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9038-9043, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are utilized to assess polychalcogenophene properties with different chalcogen substitutions, including polonium, for both neutral and cationic species. Studied properties include bond length, chain twisting, aromaticity and optical properties. Heavier heteroatoms reduce band gaps and cause ring distortion. The inter&#8208;ring bond indicates quinoidal character. Furans are consistent outliers. Doping causes diminishment of bond&#8208;length alternation and further reduction of band gaps.







Abstract
Heavy atom substitution in chalcogenophenes is a versatile strategy for tailoring and ultimately improving conjugated polymer properties. While thiophene monomers are commonly implemented in polymer designs, relatively little is known regarding the molecular properties of the heavier chalcogenophenes. Herein, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine how group 16 heteroatoms, including the radioactive polonium, affect polychalcogenophene properties including bond length, chain twisting, aromaticity, and optical properties. Heavier chalcogenophenes are more quinoidal in character and consequently have reduced band gaps and larger degrees of planarity. We consider both the neutral and radical cationic species. Upon p&#8208;type doping, bond length rearrangement is indicative of a more delocalized electronic structure, which combined with optical calculations is consistent with the polaron&#8208;model of charge storage on conjugated polymer chains. A better understanding of the properties of these materials at their molecular levels will inevitably be useful in material design as the polymer community continues to explore more main group containing polymers to tackle issues in electronic devices.

Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of yeast cell biotemplates. The electrode delivered high initial capacity (114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C), long&#8208;cycle stability (74.3&#8201;% retention after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C), and high rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C).







Abstract
We have successfully synthesized Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres from FeIII precursor as cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries through self&#8208;assembly of yeast cell biotemplate and sol&#8208;gel technology. The carbon coating on the nanoparticle surface with a mesoporous structure enhances electron diffusion into Na2FePO4F crystal particles. The improved electrochemical performance of Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposites is attributed to the larger electrode&#8722;electrolyte contact area and more active sites for Na+ on the surface of hollow microspheres compared with those of Na2FePO4F/C. The Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, long&#8208;cycle stability with a capacity retention of 74.3&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C, and excellent rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C) compared with Na2FePO4F/C. This novel nanocomposite hollow microsphere structure is suitable for improving the property of other cathode materials for high&#8208;power batteries.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation: Sodium Borohydride Synthesis by Reacting Hydrated Borax with Aluminum</title>

A cost&#8208;effective way to produce NaBH4 with high yield by ball milling hydrated borax (Na2B4O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O) with cheap Al or Al88Si12 at ambient condition is presented. An effective strategy was developed to facilitate mass transfer during the reaction by introducing NaH to enable the formation of loose NaAlO2 instead of dense Al2O3 on Al surface, and by using Si as a milling additive that prevents agglomeration and also breaks up passivation layers.







Abstract
A significant obstacle in the large&#8208;scale applications of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) for hydrogen storage is its high cost. Herein, we report a new method to synthesize NaBH4 by ball milling hydrated sodium tetraborate (Na2B4O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O) with low&#8208;cost Al or Al88Si12, instead of Na, Mg or Ca. An effective strategy is developed to facilitate mass transfer during the reaction by introducing NaH to enable the formation of NaAlO2 instead of dense Al2O3 on Al surface, and by using Si as a milling additive to prevent agglomeration and also break up passivation layers. Another advantage of this process is that hydrogen in Na2B4O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O serves as a hydrogen source for NaBH4 generation. Considering the low cost of the starting materials and simplicity in operation, our studies demonstrate the potential of producing NaBH4 in a more economical way than the commercial process.

Considering the low cost of the starting materials and simplicity in operation, our studies demonstrate the potential of producing NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a more economical way than the commercial process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Generated Trimetallic Molybdate Nanoflowers on Ni Foam Assisted with Microwave for Highly Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9044-9053, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trimetallic Ni0.90Al0.10MoO4 nanoflowers in&#8208;situ grown on the conductive substrate of Ni foam were synthetized for highly enhanced OER. The optimal Ni0.9Al0.1MoO4&#8208;NF requires an overpotential of 266&#8197;mV for OER at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which outperforms commercial RuO2 catalysts (274&#8197;mV). The doping of Al contributes to effectively regulating the electronic structure of Ni centers in NiMoO4 and greatly reduces the hydrogen adsorption free energy, consequently improving the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered as a critical half&#8208;cell reaction of water splitting, the kinetics of which is sluggish even not favored, thus requiring highly active electrocatalysts to shrink the reaction energy barrier and improve the energy conversion efficiency. In this study, In&#8208;situ generated trimetallic molybdate nanoflowers on Ni foam by a straightforward and time&#8208;saving solvothermal method assisted with microwave, not only bring synergistic effect into full play between multiple metals, but also construct a well&#8208;defined nanoflower&#8208;like structure accompanied by larger specific area (273.3&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and smaller size than the pristine NiMoO4. The resulting Ni0.9Al0.1MoO4&#8208;NF requires a relatively low overpotential of 266&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which outperforms commercial RuO2 catalysts (274&#8197;mV). Such excellent performance compares favorably to most previously reported NiMoO4&#8208;based electrocatalysts for OER. This work not only supplies a facile method to construct a well&#8208;defined nanoflower&#8208;like structure on foam, but also broadens our horizons into the mechanism of OER in alkaline conditions.

Effect of manganese valence on specific capacitance: Hierarchical manganese oxides microspheres were prepared by hydrothermal and calcination methods. Mn2O3 exhibited Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ transitions during the charge/discharge process. The redox reaction equations of Mn2O3 was proposed based on the electrochemical measurements. Mn2O3 exhibited superior specific capacitance due to the two redox couples and unique structure.







Abstract
Manganese oxides have attracted great interest in electrochemical energy storage due to high theoretical specific capacitance and abundant valence states. The multiple valence states in the redox reactions are beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical properties. Herein, three manganese microspheres were prepared by a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination at different temperatures using carbon spheres as templates. The trivalent manganese of Mn2O3 exhibited multiple redox transitions of Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ during the intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte ions. The possible redox reactions of Mn2O3 were proposed based on the cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammogram results. Mn2O3 microsphere integrated the advantages of multiple redox couples and unique structure, demonstrating a high specific capacitance and long cycling stability. The symmetric Mn2O3//Mn2O3 device yielded a maximum energy density of 29.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

The catalytic effect of the [Mo7O24]6&#8722; polyoxometalate for the hydrolysis of the phosphoester bond is produced by means of decomposition of [Mo7O24]6&#8722; into [Mo2O8H4], [Mo3O8]2+ and [Mo5O15] species. Since [Mo2O8H4] is neutral after protonation in the acidic pH, its in&#8197;situ generation would explain why highly negatively charged species as polyoxometalates are able to approximate to the negatively charged environment of the phosphoester bond and produce the catalysis.







Abstract
Phosphoester hydrolysis is an important chemical step in DNA repair. One archetypal molecular model of phosphoesters is para&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). It has been shown previously that the presence of molecular metal oxide [Mo7O24]6&#8722; may catalyse the hydrolysis of pNPP through the partial decomposition of polyoxomolybdate framework resulting in a [(PO4)2Mo5O15]6&#8722; product. Real&#8208;time monitoring of the catalytic system using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) provided a glance into the species present in the reaction mixture and identification of potential catalytic candidates. Following up on the obtained spectrometric data, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to characterise the hypothetical intermediate [Mo5O15(pNPP)2(H2O)6]6&#8722; that would be required to form under the hypothesised transformation. Surprisingly, our results point to the dimeric [Mo2O8]4&#8722; anion resulting from the decomposition of [Mo7O24]6&#8722; as the active catalytic species involved in the hydrolysis of pNPP rather than the originally assumed {Mo5O15} species. A similar study was carried out involving the same species but substituting Mo by W. The mechanism involving W species showed a higher barrier and less stable products in agreement with the non&#8208;catalytic effect found in experimental results.

A new 2D chiral hybrid halide ferroelectric perovskite, [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2CdCl4 (4PBA&#8722;CdCl4) experiences two continuous phase transitions from a centrosymmetric triclinic P

Two&#8208;dimensional hybrid halide perovskites with single chiral and ferroelectricity together with various structural phase transitions provide the possibility for more diverse functional properties. Here, we present a 2D chiral hybrid halide perovskite ferroelectric, [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2CdCl4 (4PBA&#8722;CdCl4, 4PBA=4&#8208;phenylbutylamine) that experiences two continuous phase transitions from centrosymmetric triclinic P
 to polar chiral monoclinic P2 and then to another centrosymmetric tetragonal P4/mmm with increasing temperature, accompanied by symmetry breaking, due to the prominent octahedral distortion and disorder transformation of organic 4PBA cations. In the polar chiral phase, 4PBA&#8722;CdCl4 gives a significant CD signal and has a moderate ferroelectric polarization of 0.35&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. In addition, 4PBA&#8722;CdCl4 occupies a wide band gap of 4.376&#8197;eV that is chiefly contributed by the inorganic CdCl6 octahedron. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new phase transitions and related physical properties in hybrid halide perovskites and other hybrid crystals.

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

A pyridinium ligand coordinated pentacyanoferrate(II) chromophore was incorporated into a cyanide&#8208;based CoFe extended bulk framework, in which the iron photosensitizer units are connected to cobalt water oxidation catalytic sites through cyanide linkers. Ultrafast transient absorption and computational studies reveal that iron and cobalt sites mutually support each other, which suggests that a metal ion supported iron chromophore could be a viable approach to build iron&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells.







Abstract
The replacement of traditional ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitizers with low&#8208;cost and abundant iron analogs is a key step for the advancement of scalable and sustainable dye&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a pyridinium ligand coordinated pentacyanoferrate(II) chromophore is used to construct a cyanide&#8208;based CoFe extended bulk framework, in which the iron photosensitizer units are connected to cobalt water oxidation catalytic sites through cyanide linkers. The iron&#8208;sensitized photoanode exhibits exceptional stability for at least 5&#8197;h at pH&#8197;7 and features its photosensitizing ability with an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion capacity up to 500&#8197;nm with nanosecond scale excited state lifetime. Ultrafast transient absorption and computational studies reveal that iron and cobalt sites mutually support each other for charge separation via short bridging cyanide groups and for injection to the semiconductor in our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept photoelectrochemical device. The reorganization of the excited states due to the mixing of electronic states of metal&#8208;based orbitals subsequently tailor the electron transfer cascade during the photoelectrochemical process. This breakthrough in chromophore&#8208;catalyst assemblies will spark interest in dye&#8208;sensitization with robust bulk systems for photoconversion applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Functionalizable Symmetrically and Unsymmetrically Substituted Triarylboranes from Bench&#8208;Stable Boron Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9094-9101, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widely applicable one&#8208;pot synthetic approach to air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable triarylboranes with up to three different aromatic rings starting from bench&#8208;stable boron precursors is reported. In addition, these compounds are shown to be easily post&#8208;functionalized, thus making them versatile building blocks for the syntheses of functional materials.







Abstract
A novel and convenient methodology for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sterically congested triarylboranes by using bench&#8208;stable aryltrifluoroborates as the boron source is reported. This procedure gives systematic access to symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted triarylboranes of the types BAr2Ar&#8217; and BArAr'Ar&#8217;&#8217;, respectively. Three unsymmetrically substituted triarylboranes as well as their iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation products are reported. These borylated triarylboranes contain one to three positions that can subsequently be orthogonally functionalized in follow&#8208;up reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings or Sonogashira couplings.

         <title>Ultimate Corrosion to Pt&#8208;Cu Electrocatalysts for Enhancing Methanol Oxidation Activity and Stability in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9124-9128, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid tested: An ultimate corrosion method to Pt&#8722;Cu electrocatalysts is presented that greatly promotes electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation under acidic conditions. The formation mechanism has been investigated, and a mesostructured re&#8208;formation and atomic re&#8208;organization process is proposed. Our method could potentially be extended to the facile synthesis of highly acid stable Pt&#8208;based alloys with excellent electrocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Alloying platinum (Pt) with transition metals (M), as an established class of electrocatalysts, reduces the use of Pt and improves the electrocatalytic performance. However, the stability of transition metals in nanostructured platinum alloys is a fundamental and practical problem in electrocatalysis, due to leaching of transition metals under acidic operating condition. Here, a corrosion method has been developed for a Pt&#8722;Cu electrocatalyst with high activity (6.6 times that of commercial Pt/C) and excellent stability for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) under acidic operating conditions. The mechanism of formation has been studied, and possible mesostructured re&#8208;formation and atomic re&#8208;organization have been proposed. This work offers an effective strategy for the facile synthesis of a highly acid&#8208;stable PtM alloying and opens a door to high&#8208;performance design for electrocatalysts.

         <title>Coordination Properties of Hydroxyisophthalic Acids: Topological Correlations, Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties of New Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9180-9192, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological regularities in coordination networks allowed the design of new compounds of K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, NH4+ with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalate dianion. The structures exhibit cluster structural groups, coordination of water, and the ligand through asymmetric coordination modes, aromatic stacking, and H&#8208;bonds competing with coordination bonds. The structural features favor second harmonic generation and possible proton transport.







Abstract
Hydroxyisophthalic acids are valuable polytopic ligands for the design of functional materials based on coordination polymers due to the variety of charges and coordination modes they possess. Herein, we describe the synthesis, thermal stability, nonlinear optical (NLO) and spectroscopic properties of five novel coordination compounds, [K2L(H2O)2], [MgL(H2O)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O, [CaL(H2O)3], [SrL(H2O)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, [BaL(H2O)(H2O)5], and one salt, (NH4)2L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L), which has not been tested in assembling crystalline coordination networks before. The peculiarities of the structural organization of the compounds were analyzed and compared with those for other hydroxyisophthalates. The coordination properties of hydroxyisophthalic acids were studied from the topological point of view, and a comparative topological analysis of coordination and H&#8208;bonded networks was performed. Structural correlations revealed in this study could be useful for the design of hydroxyisophthalate&#8208;based coordination networks, including porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks, proton conductors, and NLO materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topological regularities in coordination networks&lt;/b&gt; allowed the design of new compounds of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with 4,5,6-trihydroxyisophthalate dianion. The structures exhibit cluster structural groups, coordination of water, and the ligand through asymmetric coordination modes, aromatic stacking, and H-bonds competing with coordination bonds. The structural features favor second harmonic generation and possible proton transport.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroxyisophthalic acids are valuable polytopic ligands for the design of functional materials based on coordination polymers due to the variety of charges and coordination modes they possess. Herein, we describe the synthesis, thermal stability, nonlinear optical (NLO) and spectroscopic properties of five novel coordination compounds, [K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], [MgL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [CaL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], [SrL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [BaL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;], and one salt, (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with 4,5,6-trihydroxyisophthalic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L), which has not been tested in assembling crystalline coordination networks before. The peculiarities of the structural organization of the compounds were analyzed and compared with those for other hydroxyisophthalates. The coordination properties of hydroxyisophthalic acids were studied from the topological point of view, and a comparative topological analysis of coordination and H-bonded networks was performed. Structural correlations revealed in this study could be useful for the design of hydroxyisophthalate-based coordination networks, including porous metal-organic frameworks, proton conductors, and NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Efficient K Ion Storage of M2P2O7/C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) Anode Derived from Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phosphate Precursors</title>

Novel structured M2P2O7/C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) nanoflake composites are prepared via an organic&#8208;phosphors precursor assisted solvothermal method and a post high temperature annealing process, which could deliver superior potassium storage performance.







Abstract
Metal phosphates have been widely explored in lithium ion batteries and sodium ion batteries owing to high theoretical capacities, mild toxicity and low cost. However, their potassium ion battery applications are less reported due to the limited conductivity and the slow diffusion kinetics. Considering these drawbacks, novel structured M2P2O7/C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) nanoflake composites are prepared through an organic&#8208;phosphors precursor&#8208;assisted solvothermal method and a subsequent high temperature annealing process. The designed Co2P2O7/C composite exhibits the highest rate capacity with 502&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and good cyclability for 900 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 when compared with Ni and Fe based composites. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to their unique nanoparticle&#8208;assembled nanoflake structure, which can afford enough active sites for K+ intercalation. In addition, the robust pyrophosphate crystal structure and the in&#8197;situ formed carbon composition also have positive effects on enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling performance and the electrode's conductivity. Finally, this organic&#8208;phosphors precursor induced simple approach can be applied for easy fabrication of other pyrophosphate/carbon hybrids as advanced electrodes.

         <title>Affinity Selections of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries on Carbonic Anhydrase IX&#8208;Expressing Tumor Cells Reveal a Dependence on Ligand Valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 8985-8993, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries were screened against live cells, first in a model system to apply systematically optimized conditions using a library comprising 1 million members. Both, selection conditions and bivalent ligand display had a crucial impact on the success of cell&#8208;based selections.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries are typically screened against purified protein targets. Recently, cell&#8208;based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code&#8208;specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15&#8208;fold enrichment factors for high&#8208;affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; KD=8.7&#8197;nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100&#8208;fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor&#8208;associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.

         <title>Multifunctional Materials Serving as Efficient Non&#8208;Doped Violet&#8208;Blue Emitters and Host Materials for Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9102-9111, June 21, 2021. </description>

The non&#8208;doped device based on TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF as emitter exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 6.76&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) of (0.152, 0.059). As host material, the green, yellow, and red phosphorescent OLEDs obtained high EQEmax of about 20&#8201;% and both devices exhibited low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Efficient multifunctional materials acting as violet&#8208;blue emitters, as well as host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs, are crucial but rare due to demand that they should have high first singlet state (S1) energy and first triplet state (T1) energy simultaneously. In this study, two new violet&#8208;blue bipolar fluorophores, TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF and SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF, were designed and synthesized by introducing the hole transporting moiety triphenylamine (TPA) and spirobifluorene (SBF) unit that has high T1 into high deep blue emission quantum yield group phenanthroimidazole (PI). As the results, the non&#8208;doped OLEDs based on TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF exhibited excellent EL performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 6.76&#8201;% and a violet&#8208;blue emission with Commission Internationale de L&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) of (0.152, 0.059). The device based on SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF displayed EQEmax of 6.19&#8201;% with CIE of (0.159, 0.049), which nearly matches the CIE coordinates of the violet&#8208;blue emitters standard of (0.131, 0.046). These EL performances are comparable to the best reported non&#8208;doped deep or violet&#8208;blue emissive OLEDs with CIEy&lt;0.06 in recent years. Additionally, the green, yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF and SBF&#8208;PI&#8208;SBF as host materials achieved a high EQEmax of about 20&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off at the ultra&#8208;high luminance of 10 000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These results provided a new construction strategy for designing high&#8208;performance violet&#8208;blue emitters, as well as efficient host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs.

         <title>Nematic Triphenyltriazine Triesters and the Induction of the Columnar Mesophase by Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 9003-9010, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine induces columnar instead of nematic self&#8208;assembly in easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize triphenyltriazine triesters, which have high triplet energies and no own fluorescence. Such matrices could lead to enhanced light outcoupling from blue delayed&#8208;fluorescent devices by emitter alignment.







Abstract
Whereas their para homologs are not mesogenic, the disk&#8208;shaped triphenyltriazine meta&#8208;trialkylesters obtained via trimerization of 3&#8208;cyanobenzoic alkylester, which are configurationally more flexible, exhibit a monotropic nematic mesophase. Introduction of fluorine atoms into the alkyl chains or into the phenyl moieties leads to the appearance of an enantiotropic columnar mesophase. If fluorine is introduced both in the chains and in the phenyl moieties, only a monotropic mesophase remains. Fluorination of either the alkyl chains or the aromatic core, but not both, appears thus as a simple means of inducing or stabilizing columnar self&#8208;assembly in disk&#8208;shaped systems. As the homeotropically alignable columnar mesophase can thus be made to persist at room temperature, as energies higher than 3&#8197;eV of the first excited triplet state are computed in agreement with the value reported for the parent arene, and as they are not fluorescent themselves, these compounds are of promise as aligning host matrices for blue&#8208;emitting TADF devices with improved light outcoupling. Dilution of a columnar with a nonmesogenic homolog induces the nematic state, indicating that the nanoscopic make&#8208;up of both mesophases is closely related.

         <dc:description>
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates for patients, with chemotherapy still the gold standard for treatment. This review collects information on all metallodrugs studied in TNBC cells and tumors. A detailed overview on compounds studied in&#8197;vivo (mostly in mice models) and those compounds for which some preliminary mechanistic data was obtained and/or for which bioactive ligands have been used is provided. The main goal of this review is to highlight the most promising metal&#8208;based compounds with potential as chemotherapeutic agents in TNBC. For more information see the Review by Nazia Nayeem and Maria Contel on page&#8197;8891&#8197;ff..

         <dc:description>
The urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used to control the specific properties of supramolecular hydrogels, which thereby can be used for different applications such as cell culturing, catalysis or drug delivery, to just name a few. The urease&#8208;urea reaction involves the formation of ammonia, which in turn influences the pH and thereby provides an option to prepare gels with different properties. More information can be found in the Minireview article by S. Panja and D. J. Adams on page&#8197;8928&#8197;ff.

A [Mo7O24]6&#8208; polyanion is used to catalyze the hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond, although the polyanion is not directly responsible for the catalysis. The real catalyst is produced in situ of the reaction media through the decomposition of the initial polyoxometalate leading to the [Mo2O8H4] dimeric species, which is the real catalytic species. Formation in situ of this neutral compound would explain why polyanions may approach the negatively charged environment of the phosphoester bond and produce the catalysis. The lower mass of the real catalytic species suggests a cheaper and greener chemical process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H.&#8197;N. Miras, N.&#8197;A. Bandeira, A. Gil, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004989).

         <dc:description>
In the quest for low&#8208;cost and scalable dye&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells, the implementation of iron chromophores to the catalytic component has been one of the main challenges. Herein, an extendable chemistry toolbox based on Prussian blue structures is adopted not only to offer an excited state lifetime exceeding 1 ns but also to demonstrate the 1st iron&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation device. The cover image was designed by Kubra Nur Ozvural. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;Ozbay, F.&#8197;Karadas et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100654).

         <title>Cover Feature: Using Small Molecules to Enhance P450 OleT Enzyme Activity in Situ (Chem. Eur. J. 35/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 8889-8889, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of small molecules was reported to enhance the catalytic efficiency of P450 OleT by interaction with the enzyme active center. The cover shows that the rotation motion of the turbine speeds up with the help of the small person, hinting that the efficiency of the decarboxylation catalyzed by P450 OleT was improved by the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;stimulated enzymatic reactions. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Yin, Q. Wang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100680).

The screening of a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library against carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells is depicted in the cover image. DNA&#8208;encoding techniques allow the construction and screening of chemical libraries of unprecedented size, but these procedures are typically performed using purified protein targets. While the introduction of cell&#8208;based selections expanded the target scope, selection parameters remained obscure. We report systemic optimizations which translated to the successful discovery of CAIX ligands via cell&#8208;based selections. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Scheuermann, D. Neri, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100816).

         <title>Rediscovering Sulfinylamines as Reagents for Organic Synthesis</title>

Recent applications of N&#8208;sulfinylamines: In this Minireview, the use of N&#8208;sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O) in sulfoximine and sulfonimidamide synthesis, heterocycle formation and catalytic enantioselective oxidation of alkenes is covered. Brief discussions of their preparation, stability, properties and potential future applications are also included.







Abstract
Sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O), monoaza analogues of sulfur dioxide, have been known for well over a century, and their reactivity as sulfur electrophiles and in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is well&#8208;established. However, they have only rarely been used in organic synthesis in recent decades despite the increasing prominence of compounds containing N=S=O functionality, such as sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. This Minireview aims to bring wider visibility to the unique chemistry enabled by this class of compounds. We focus on advances from the last 10 years, including the first examples of their use in the one&#8208;pot syntheses of sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. Also covered are the reactions of sulfinylamines with carbon&#8208;centred radicals, their use for formation of heterocycles through cycloadditions, and catalytic enantioselective allylic oxidation of alkenes via a hetero&#8208;ene reaction. These examples highlight the different reactivity modes of sulfinylamines and their underappreciated potential for forming molecules which contain high&#8208; or low&#8208;valent sulfur, or even no sulfur at all.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Urease Reaction in Controlling Properties of Supramolecular Hydrogels: Pros and Cons</title>

         <dc:description>
Autocatalytic reaction between urease and urea produces ammonia in aqueous medium which increases the pH. Here, we summarize how the urea&#8208;urease reaction can be used to control hydrogel properties. The advantages and limitations of this method compared to conventional methods of pH increase are also discussed.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are useful in many areas such as cell culturing, catalysis, sensing, tissue engineering, drug delivery, environmental remediation and optoelectronics. The gels need specific properties for each application. The properties arise from a fibrous network that forms the matrix. A common method to prepare hydrogels is to use a pH change. Most methods result in a sudden pH jump and often lead to gels that are hard to reproduce and control. The urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used to control hydrogel properties by a uniform and controlled pH increase as well as to set up pH cycles. The reaction involves hydrolysis of urea by urease and production of ammonia which increases the pH. The rate of ammonia production can be controlled which can be used to prepare gels with differing properties. Herein, we show how the urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used for the construction of next generation functional materials.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates for patients, with chemotherapy still the gold standard for treatment. This review collects information on all metallodrugs studied in TNBC cells and tumors, focusing on mechanistic and in vivo studies. An outlook towards TNBC metallodrugs with translational potential is provided.







Abstract
This review focuses on studies of coordination and organometallic compounds as potential chemotherapeutics against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates from all breast cancer types. At present, chemotherapy is still the standard of care for TNBC since only one type of targeted therapy has been recently developed. References for metal&#8208;based compounds studied in TNBC cell lines will be listed, and those of metal&#8208;specific reviews, but a detailed overview will also be provided on compounds studied in&#8197;vivo (mostly in mice models) and those compounds for which some preliminary mechanistic data was obtained (in TNBC cell lines and tumors) and/or for which bioactive ligands have been used. The main goal of this review is to highlight the most promising metal&#8208;based compounds with potential as chemotherapeutic agents in TNBC.

         <title>Developing Bright Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)&#8208;like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8722;Chromophore Interactions</title>

Redder fluorogen derived from jellyfish: Using a double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, we designed and synthesized a new yellow fluorogen from GFP chromophore (jellyfish Aequorea victoria) that shows the highest brightness upon binding a popular FAST protein tag, enabling live&#8208;cell imaging with specific staining. By effectively partitioning the environmental parameters via multivariable analysis of ultrafast spectroscopic data, the H&#8208;bonding and dipolar interactions are revealed to govern fluorogenicity.







Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Herein, a new fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of approximately 100,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, is reported. Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8722;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.

         <title>Using Small Molecules to Enhance P450 OleT Enzyme Activity in Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 8940-8945, June 21, 2021. </description>

A class of small molecules was reported to enhance the catalytic efficiency of P450 OleTSA by interaction with the enzyme active center. Up to 6&#8208;fold increase of terminal alkenes yield has been achieved in the small molecule stimulated enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 OleT is a fatty acid decarboxylase that catalyzes the production of olefins with biofuel and synthetic applications. However, the relatively sluggish catalytic efficiency of the enzyme limits its applications. Here, we report the application of a novel class of benzene containing small molecules to improve the OleT activity. The UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy study and molecular docking results confirmed the high proximity of the small molecules to the heme group of OleT. Up to 6&#8208;fold increase of product yield has been achieved in the small molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic reactions. Our work thus sheds the light to the application of small molecules to increase the OleT catalytic efficiency, which could be potentially used for future olefin productions.

New n&#8208;type material? 5,11&#8208;Diazadibenzo[hi,qr]tetracene was synthesized as a new nitrogen&#8208;substituted polycyclic heteroaromatic molecule. This compound showed enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and specific reactivities toward nucleophilic reagents. Reaction with arylamines provided an aminated product that shows an intensely NIR&#8208;absorbing character. Furthermore, a reversible interconversion into the corresponding reduced form was realized.







Abstract
5,11&#8208;Diazadibenzo[hi,qr]tetracene was synthesized as a new nitrogen&#8208;substituted polycyclic heteroaromatic compound by Pd&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of an alkyne precursor followed by oxidative cyclization with bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene. The substitution of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms significantly enhanced its electron&#8208;accepting character and facilitated the direct nucleophilic addition of arylamines under strongly basic conditions to afford the desired amino&#8208;substituted products. The introduction of amino groups induced a remarkable red&#8208;shift in their absorption spectra; the tetrasubstituted product exhibited intense near&#8208;infrared absorbing property. Furthermore, the &#960;&#8208;electronic system, which includes a redox&#8208;active 1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene moiety, underwent reversible interconversion to its corresponding reduced form upon reduction with NaBH4 and aerobic oxidation.

A coiled coil peptide programmed with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) and imidazole groups exhibits a conformational shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure upon coordination of Zn2+, whereas the introduction of other metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+) does not lead to a conformational change.







Abstract
The design of a stimuli&#8208;responsive peptide whose conformation is controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific light and metal coordination is described. The peptide adopts a defined tertiary structure and its conformation can be modulated between an &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil and &#946;&#8208;sheet. The peptide is designed with a hydrophobic interface to induce coiled coil formation and is based on a recently described strategy to obtain switchable helix dimers. Herein, we endowed the helix dimer with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) groups to achieve metal coordination and shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. It was found that the conformational shift only occurs upon introduction of Zn2+; other metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mg2, and Ni2+) do not offer switching likely due to non&#8208;specific metal&#8208;peptide coordination. A control peptide lacking the metal&#8208;coordinating residues does not show conformational switching with Zn2+ supporting the role of this metal in stabilizing the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation in a defined manner.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Direct Electrochemical Methanol Reforming Enabled by CO&#8208;Immune Mo&#8208;Based Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 35, Page 8960-8965, June 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Finding an antidote: Electrochemical methanol reforming to hydrogen is a simple, yet underdeveloped, approach for hydrogen storage; however, conventional metal catalysts are poisoned either by methanol crossover or by intermediate species (such as CO) from the corresponding methanol oxidation. Herein, the relative immunity of Mo&#8208;based catalysts to CO is demonstrated, and the origins of this behavior are explored, with surprising implications for the general mechanism of H2 evolution on Mo&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen storage in the form of intermediate artificial fuels such as methanol is important for future chemical and energy applications, and the electrochemical regeneration of hydrogen from methanol is thermodynamically favorable compared to direct water splitting. However, CO produced from methanol oxidation can adsorb to H2&#8208;evolution catalysts and drastically reduce activity. In this study, we explore the origins of CO immunity in Mo&#8208;containing H2&#8208;evolution catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts such as Pt or Ni, Mo&#8208;based catalysts display remarkable immunity to CO poisoning. The origin of this behavior in NiMo appears to arise from the apparent inability of CO to bind Mo under electrocatalytic conditions, with mechanistic consequences for the H2&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) in these systems. This specific property of Mo&#8208;based HER catalysts makes them ideal in environments where poisons might be present.

Herein, the relative immunity of Mo-based catalysts to CO is demonstrated, and the origins of this behavior are explored, with surprising implications for the general mechanism of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution on Mo-based catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen storage in the form of intermediate artificial fuels such as methanol is important for future chemical and energy applications, and the electrochemical regeneration of hydrogen from methanol is thermodynamically favorable compared to direct water splitting. However, CO produced from methanol oxidation can adsorb to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evolution catalysts and drastically reduce activity. In this study, we explore the origins of CO immunity in Mo-containing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evolution catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts such as Pt or Ni, Mo-based catalysts display remarkable immunity to CO poisoning. The origin of this behavior in NiMo appears to arise from the apparent inability of CO to bind Mo under electrocatalytic conditions, with mechanistic consequences for the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evolution reaction (HER) in these systems. This specific property of Mo-based HER catalysts makes them ideal in environments where poisons might be present.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

&#8220;All current dye&#8208;sensitized water oxidation electrodes rely on molecular ruthenium components, which suffer from high cost and low stability. Iron is the ideal candidate to replace ruthenium since they are in the same group. Herein, we show the first example of an iron&#8208;sensitized water oxidation photoanode by incorporating an iron chromophore into a Prussian blue network. This study indicates that the excited state lifetime of an iron chromophore could be extended by connecting it to a donor metal site in close proximity (Cover design: Kubra N. Ozvural).&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;8966&#8197;ff. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100654).

         <title>Synthesis and Surface Behavior of NDI&#8208;Chromophores Mounted on a Tripodal Scaffold: Towards Self&#8208;Decoupled Chromophores for Single Molecule Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the efficient synthesis, the absorption and the emission spectra and the electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetra&#173;carbox&#173;di&#173;imide (NDI) tripodal molecules comprising thioacetate anchors for their surface investigations. Our studies showed that particularly pyrrolidinyl group with strong electron&#8208;donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core&#8208;substituted NDI chromophore and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94 eV. The redox properties of NDIs are influenced by core substituents as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. The strong electron donating character of pyrrolidine substituents results in relatively high HOMO and LUMO levels of &#8208;5.31 and &#8208;3.37 eV when compared with the parental unsubstituted NDI. UHV&#8208;STM measurements of a submonolayer of the rigid tripodal NDI chromophores deposited on Au(111) by spray deposition show that these molecules mainly tend to adsorb flat in a pairwise fashion on the surface and form unordered films. However, the STML experiments also reveal a few molecular clusters, which might consist of upright oriented molecules protruding from the molecular island and show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields of up to 6&#215;10  &#8208;3  . These results demonstrate the promising potential of the NDI tripodal chromophores for the fabrication of molecular devices profiting from optical features of the molecular layer.</dc:description>

         <title>The Binding Pocket at the Interface of Multimeric Telomere G&#8208;quadruplexes: Myth or Reality?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human telomeric DNA with hundreds of repeats of the 5&#8217;&#8208;TTAGGG&#8208;3&#8217; motif plays a crucial role in several biological processes. It folds into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures and features a pocket at the interface of two contiguous G4 blocks. Up to now no structural NMR and crystallographic data are available for ligands interacting with contiguous G4s. We investigated naphthalene diimide monomers and dyads as ligands of a dimeric G4 of human telomeric DNA comparing the results with those of the model monomeric G4. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling were used to elucidate binding features. Ligand fluorescence lifetime and induced circular dichroism unveiled occupancy of the binding site at the interface. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the hypothesis as they remarkably change for the dyad complexes of the monomeric and dimeric telomeric G4. The bi&#8208;functional ligand structure of the dyads is a fundamental requisite for binding at the G4 interface as only the dyads engage in complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry, lodging in the pocket at the interface and establishing multiple interactions with the DNA skeleton. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data, our study affords important proofs of binding at the interface pocket and clues on the role played by the ligand structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Dimensional Nanostructure (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Decorated MWCNT) as a Nanofiller in Mixed&#8208;Matrix Membranes for Enhanced CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Schiff base strategy was exploited to produce mixed&#8208;dimensional nanostructures by coupling 3D UiO&#8208;66 and 1D MWCNT. The resultant MDN was used as nanofiller in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes to separate CO2 from CH4. The MMM containing 5.0&#8197;wt.&#8201;% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a permeability for pure CO2 nearly twice that of a pure PSf membrane. The CO2/CH4 selectivity of this MMM was also better under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) with combination of two distinct dimensional nanofillers (such as 1D&#8208;3D, 2D&#8208;3D, or 3D&#8208;3D, etc.) have drawn special attention for gas separation applications due to their concerted effects on gas permeation and mechanical properties. An amine&#8208;functionalized 1D multiwalled carbon nanotube (NH2&#8208;MWCNT) with exceptional mechanical strength and rapid gas transport was crosslinked with an amine&#8208;functionalized 3D metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) with high CO2 affinity in a Schiff base reaction. The resultant crosslinked mixed&#8208;dimensional nanostructure was used as a nanofiller in a polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix to explore the underlying synergy between 1D and 3D nanostructures on the gas separation performance of MMMs. Cross&#8208;sectional scanning electron microscopy and mapping revealed the homogenous dispersion of UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT in the polymer matrix. The MMM containing 5.0&#8197;wt.&#8201;% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a superior permeability 8.3 Barrer as compared to the 4.2 Barrer of pure PSf membrane for CO2. Moreover, the selectivity (CO2/CH4) of this MMM was enhanced to 39.5 from the 28.0 observed for pure PSf under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.

         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic chemistry: Synthesizing the eagle murder's weapon. With the identification of the alkaloid Aetokthonotoxin (AETX) as the neurotoxin causing wildlife deaths in the USA, further studies to characterize the biological effects of this natural product are mandatory. These studies will be enabled by a total synthesis of this natural product, which has been achieved in only five steps overall.







Abstract
Aetokthonotoxin has recently been identified as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy, a fatal neurologic disease, spreading through a trophic cascade and affecting birds of prey such as the bald eagle in the USA. Here, we describe the total synthesis of this specialized metabolite. The complex, highly brominated 1,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole could be synthesized via a Somei&#8208;type Michael reaction as key step.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heterocyclic chemistry&lt;/b&gt;: Synthesizing the eagle murder's weapon. With the identification of the alkaloid Aetokthonotoxin (AETX) as the neurotoxin causing wildlife deaths in the USA, further studies to characterize the biological effects of this natural product are mandatory. These studies will be enabled by a total synthesis of this natural product, which has been achieved in only five steps overall.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aetokthonotoxin has recently been identified as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy, a fatal neurologic disease, spreading through a trophic cascade and affecting birds of prey such as the bald eagle in the USA. Here, we describe the total synthesis of this specialized metabolite. The complex, highly brominated 1,2&#8217;-biindole could be synthesized via a Somei-type Michael reaction as key step. The optimised sequence yielded the natural product in five steps with an overall yield of 29&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

Getting at the Hyp of amanitin: A formal study of structure&#8208;function relationships for trans&#8208;hydroxyproline &#8211; a key functionality the specifies the toxicity of amanitin is undertaken to probe aspects of H&#8208;bonding and other interactions with analogs of hydroxyl&#8208;proline. The toxin is surprisingly refractory to replacing the hydroxyproline.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;amanitin, an extremely toxic bicyclic octapeptide extracted from the death&#8208;cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides, is a highly selective allosteric inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Following on growing interest in using this toxin as a payload in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, herein we report the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of several new derivatives of this toxin to probe the role of the trans&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp), which is known to be critical for toxicity. This structure activity relationship (SAR) study represents the first of its kind to use various Hyp&#8208;analogs to alter the conformational and H&#8208;bonding properties of Hyp in amanitin.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex formation by DNA sequences deficient in guanines: Two tetrad parallel quadruplexes do not fold intramolecularly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical forms of nucleic acids which are frequently found in genomes. The stability of G4s depends, among other factors, on the number of G&#8208;tetrads. Three&#8208; or four&#8208;tetrad G4s and antiparallel two&#8208;tetrad G4s have been characterized experimentally; however, the existence of an intramolecular (i.e., not dimeric or multimeric) two&#8208;tetrad parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G4 has never been experimentally observed. Many sequences compatible with two&#8208;tetrad G4 can be found in important genomic regions such as promoters, for which parallel G4s predominate. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, we study the propensity of the model sequence AATGGGTGGGTTTGGGTGGGTAA to form an intramolecular parallel&#8208;stranded G4 upon increasing the number of GGG&#8208;to&#8208;GG substitutions. Deletion of a single G leads to the formation of intramolecular G4s with a stacked G&#8208;triad, whose topology depends on the location of the deletion. Removal of another guanine from another G&#8208;tract leads to bi&#8208; or multi&#8208;meric G4s. Further deletions mostly prevent formation of any stable G4. Thus, a solitary two&#8208;tetrad parallel DNA G4 is not thermodynamically stable and requires additional interactions through some capping residues. However, transiently populated metastable two&#8208;tetrad species can associate to form stable dimers, the dynamic formation of which may play additional delicate roles in gene regulation. These findings provide essential information for bioinformatics studies searching for potential G4s in genomes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology and its controlled delivery has great prospect in therapeutic applications. &#160;The light&#8208;activated NO uncaging from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of the easy and real&#8208;time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in cell environment. In this contribution, we seek to provide an overview of the advances in photoactivatable NO releasers bearing fluorescent reporting functionalities achieved in our and other laboratories, highlighting the rationale design and their potential therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co&#8208;catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to  M  n  = 189 000 Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically we postulate that the co&#8208;catalyst does not form an iron(II) hydride  in situ  , but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclobutane side&#8208;product is also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd/OCNT is deactivated during the transfer hydrogenation of phenol with formic acid to cyclohexanone because of the full coverage of formate on Pd. By comparison, Pd/NCNT is highly active and selective in the transfer hydrogenation and deactivation does not occur. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the transfer hydrogenation with the adsorbed formate on Pd.







Abstract
Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H2 or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N&#8208;doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.

Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen- and oxygen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N-doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N-doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise or concerted, the outcome is the best: An asymmetric synthesis of benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, basic antibiotic skeletons, in very good yields, dr and ee has been developed through the tandem Wittig/[3+2] annulation of lawsone aldehydes and phosphoranes under a catalytic amount of quinine&#8208;thiourea. The sustainability of this new reaction was investigated by changing various reaction coordinates; the catalyst was recovered at more than 50&#8201;%.







Abstract
Lawsone aldehydes were directly transformed into the biologically important, unique carbon skeleton of chiral methanobenzo[f]azulenes/methanodibenzo[a,d][7]annulenes in high dr and ee and in very good yields by using quinine&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalyzed tandem Wittig/intramolecular Michael/intramolecular aldol reactions. This asymmetric catalytic tandem protocol will be highly useful because these final molecules are basic skeletons of important antibiotics.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;Abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hunt is still on for the most powerful neutral superbase. The steadily growing scope of applications has resulted in a renaissance of highly electron&#8208;rich phosphorus&#8208;containing Lewis and Br&#248;nsted bases. Strongly &#960;&#8208;donating substituents at the center of basicity can be employed to increase the proton affinity and the &#963;&#8208;donation ability. This minireview highlights recently published achievements focusing especially on the past five years.







Abstract
The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capacity for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases have appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have now made them indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Herein, an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes is given. In addition, due to widespread interest, their use in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Induced Polarization Destabilizes the Noncovalent Interactions of N&#8208;Methylated Lysines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation of ammonium weakens its electrostatic attraction with protein functional groups &#8208; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;kT, respectively. The weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be widely present.







Abstract
Lysine methylation can modify noncovalent interactions by altering lysine's hydrophobicity as well as its electronic structure. Although the ramifications of the former are documented, the effects of the latter remain largely unknown. Understanding the electronic structure is important for determining how biological methylation modulates protein&#8722;protein binding, and the impact of artificial methylation experiments in which methylated lysines are used as spectroscopic probes and protein crystallization facilitators. The benchmarked first&#8208;principles calculations undertaken here reveal that methyl&#8208;induced polarization weakens the electrostatic attraction of amines with protein functional groups &#8211; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;kT, respectively. Multipole analysis shows that weakened electrostatics is due to the altered inductive effects, which overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be present in many cases. A survey of methylated lysines in protein structures reveals several cases in which methyl&#8208;induced polarization is the primary driver of altered noncovalent interactions; in these cases, destabilizations are found to be in the 0.6&#8211;4.7&#8201;kT range. The clearest case of where methyl&#8208;induced polarization plays a dominant role in regulating biological function is that of the PHD1&#8208;PHD2 domain, which recognizes lysine&#8208;methylated states on histones. These results broaden our understanding of how methylation modulates noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Rapid Aqueous Synthesis of Large&#8208;Size and Edge/Defect&#8208;Rich Porous Pd and Pd&#8208;Alloyed Nanomesh for Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and rapid aqueous synthesis of Pd and Pd&#8208;alloyed porous nanomeshes (PNMs) with multiple structural advantages like ultrathinness, large&#8208;size, porosity, edge/defect richness, and being ligand&#8208;free results in more catalytically active sites and high atomic efficiency. Synergic structural and compositional enhancement effects enhanced the mass activity, anti&#8208;poisoning ability, and stability/durability in electrocatalytic EOR of PNM Pd87Cu13 compared to PdCu PNMs with other elemental ratios, Pd PNMs, and Pd NPs.







Abstract
In this work, a facile aqueous synthesis strategy was used (complete in 5&#8197;min at room temperature) to produce large&#8208;size Pd, PdCu, and PdPtCu nanomeshes without additional organic ligands or solvent and the volume restriction of reaction solution. The obtained metallic nanomeshes possess graphene&#8208;like morphology and a large size of dozens of microns. Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores are seen in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomeshes disclosed that they undergo oriented attachment growth along the &#10216;111&#10217; direction. Owing to structural and compositional advantages, PdCu porous nanomeshes with certain elemental ratios (e.&#8201;g., Pd87Cu13) presented enhanced electrocatalytic performance (larger mass activity, better CO tolerance and stability) toward ethanol oxidation.

         <title>Externally Regulated Specific Molecular Recognition Driven Pathway Selectivity in Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Externally added 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) introduces new nucleation conditions and influences the thermodynamic landscape in the supramolecular polymerization of a carboxylic&#8208;acid appended NDI&#8208;monomer. With 100&#8201;% DMAP, well&#8208;defined J&#8208;aggregation results in the formation of fibrillar morphology, irrespective of the cooling rate. With 10&#8201;% DMAP, depending on the cooling rate, either J&#8208;aggregate or H&#8208;aggregate (or mixture) is noticed with 1D and 2D morphology, respectively. With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling, extended 2D sheet can be obtained from the thermodynamically controlled H&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
This article reveals 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene&#8208;diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI&#8208;1 produces ill&#8208;defined aggregate (Agg&#8208;1) due to different H&#8208;bonding motifs of the &#8722;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI&#8208;1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J&#8208;aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg&#8208;2). With 10&#8201;% DMAP and fast cooling (10&#8197;K/min), similar nucleation and open chain H&#8208;bonding with the free monomer in an anti&#8208;parallel arrangement produces identical J&#8208;aggregate (Agg&#8208;2a).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Externally added 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&lt;/b&gt; introduces new nucleation conditions and influences the thermodynamic landscape in the supramolecular polymerization of a carboxylic-acid appended NDI-monomer. With 100&#8201;% DMAP, well-defined J-aggregation results in the formation of fibrillar morphology, irrespective of the cooling rate. With 10&#8201;% DMAP, depending on the cooling rate, either J-aggregate or H-aggregate (or mixture) is noticed with 1D and 2D morphology, respectively. With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling, extended 2D sheet can be obtained from the thermodynamically controlled H-aggregation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article reveals 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene-diimide derivative (NDI-1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI-1 produces ill-defined aggregate (Agg-1) due to different H-bonding motifs of the &#8722;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI-1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J-aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg-2). With 10&#8201;% DMAP and fast cooling (10&#8197;K/min), similar nucleation and open chain H-bonding with the free monomer in an anti-parallel arrangement produces identical J-aggregate (Agg-2a). With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling (1&#8197;K/min), a distinct nucleation and supramolecular polymerization pathway emerge leading to the thermodynamically controlled Agg-3 with face-to-face stacking and 2D-morphology. Slow cooling with 5&#8211;10&#8201;% DMAP produces a mixture of Agg-2a and Agg-3. Computational modelling studies provide valuable insights into the internal order and the pathway complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;Derived 1D Carbon Nanofiber Architecture with Simultaneous Decoration of Single Fe&#8722;Nx Sites and Fe/Fe3C Nanoparticles for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>

Formidable fibers: A gelatin&#8208;derived 1D hybrid electrocatalyst with highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated into Fe,N co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was synthesized. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy is reported for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofiber architectures with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8722;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the FeIII&#8208;complex&#8208;assisted electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of a FeIII complex enables the 1D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolytes. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work opens a path for the design and synthesis of 1D carbon electrocatalyst for efficient ORR catalysis.

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot metals: Au&#8208;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites are a promising class of plasmonic nanomaterials that can be rationally designed to achieve strong light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency. In this Minireview, we show the different hybrid configurations that are possible for Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites, present various synthetic strategies for their fabrication, and discuss their tunable plasmon&#8208;induced absorption features and photothermal properties. We also demonstrate their potential use in photothermal therapy and in the blossoming field of theranostics.







Abstract
Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu2&#8722;xS, their combination on the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral ranges. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing properties translate to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, making them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8722;Cu2&#8722;xS nanocomposites are presented, with a focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8211;shell, reverse core&#8211;shell, and yolk&#8211;shell configurations. The photothermal behavior of these materials is also discussed, providing a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.

         <title>Relevance of &#960;&#8208;Backbonding for the Reactivity of Electrophilic Anions [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of &#960;&#8208;backbonding is discussed, which was observed between the &#960;&#8208;acceptors CO/N2 and the closo&#8208;dodecaborate fragments [B12X11]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN). The highly reactive [B12X11]&#8722; anions transfer electron density from their delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems into antibonding orbitals of the respective acceptor molecules. Moreover, the comprehensive set of data provided with this study gives insights into the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8722; anions depending on the substituent X.







Abstract
Electrophilic anions of type [B12X11]&#8722; posses a vacant positive boron binding site within the anion. In a comparatitve experimental and theoretical study, the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8722; with X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN is characterized towards different nucleophiles: (i) noble gases (NGs) as &#963;&#8208;donors and (ii) CO/N2 as &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptors. Temperature&#8208;dependent formation of [B12X11NG]&#8722; indicates the enthalpy order (X=CN)&gt;(X=Cl)&#8776;(X=Br)&gt;(X=I)&#8776;(X=F) almost independent of the NG in good agreement with calculated trends. The observed order is explained by an interplay of the electron deficiency of the vacant boron site in [B12X11]&#8722; and steric effects. The binding of CO and N2 to [B12X11]&#8722; is significantly stronger. The B3LYP 0&#8197;K attachment enthapies follow the order (X=F)&gt;(X=CN)&gt;(X=Cl)&gt;(X=Br)&gt;(X=I), in contrast to the NG series. The bonding motifs of [B12X11CO]&#8722; and [B12X11N2]&#8722; were characterized using cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy by focusing on the CO and N2 stretching frequencies 
 and 
, respectively. Observed shifts of 
 and 
 are explained by an interplay between electrostatic effects (blue shift), due to the positive partial charge, and by &#960;&#8208;backdonation (red shift). Energy decomposition analysis and analysis of natural orbitals for chemical valence support all conclusions based on the experimental results. This establishes a rational understanding of [B12X11]&#8722; reactivety dependent on the substituent X and provides first systematic data on &#960;&#8208;backdonation from delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems of closo&#8208;borate anions.

         <title>Correlation between the Dynamics of Nanoconfined Water and the Local Chemical Environment in Calcium Silicate Hydrate Nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xonotlite and tobermorite minerals are characterized by layered structures containing pendant CaOH and SiOH groups that interact with confined water molecules. In these systems, the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and the dynamics of confined water are modified by the presence of different chemical environments. Herein, is shown that the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; distribution of water molecules found in the SiOH&#8208;rich environments, as in tobermorite, is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the CaOH&#8208;rich environment in xonotlite.







Abstract
Calcium silicate hydrates are members of a large family of minerals with layered structures containing pendant CaOH and SiOH groups that interact with confined water molecules. To rationalize the impact of the local chemical environment on the dynamics of water, SiOH&#8208; and CaOH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals were synthesized by using the continuous supercritical hydrothermal method and then systematically studied by a combination of spectroscopic techniques. In our comprehensive analysis, the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hanging hydroxy groups can be univocally assigned to CaOH or SiOH environments, and the local chemical environment largely affects the H&#8208;bond network of the solvation water. Interestingly, the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; solvation water found in the SiOH&#8208;rich environments is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the CaOH&#8208;rich environment. This refined picture of the dynamics of confined water and hydroxy groups in calcium silicate hydrates can also be applied to other water&#8208;containing materials, with a significant impact in many fields of materials science.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Molecular Docking Study of the Interaction between Neutral Re(I) Tetrazolate Complexes and Bovine Serum Albumin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and two Re(I) complexes, differing in the functionality attached to the tetrazole, were investigated using spectroscopic methods and molecular modelling. Molecular docking was applied for the first time using Re(I) complexes as binding partners for BSA. This study revealed that subtle changes in the functional group of Re(I) complexes influence their interactions with BSA.







Abstract
Re(I) complexes have potential in biomedical sciences as imaging agents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Re(I) complexes interact with carrier proteins, like serum albumins. Here, two neutral Re(I) complexes were used (fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)L], in which L is either 4&#8208;cyanophenyltetrazolate (1) or 4&#8208;methoxycarbonylphenyltetrazole ester (2), to study the interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spectroscopic measurements, calculations of thermodynamic and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer parameters, as well as molecular modelling, were performed to study differential binding between BSA and complex 1 and 2. Induced&#8208;fit docking combined with quantum&#8208;polarised ligand docking were employed in what is believed to be a first for a Re(I) complex as a ligand for BSA. Our findings provide a basis for other molecular interaction studies and suggest that subtle functional group alterations at the terminal region of the Re(I) complex have a significant impact on the ability of this class of compounds to interact with BSA.

N&#8208;terminal thiourea&#8208;modified helical l&#8208;Leu&#8208;based peptide (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed a highly enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction between various &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes and dialkyl malonates to give 1,4&#8208;adducts with a 65&#8211;96&#8201;% ee. The length of the peptide chain, right&#8208;handed helical structure, amide N&#8722;Hs, and the N&#8208;terminal thiourea moiety played crucial roles in the asymmetric induction.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal thiourea&#8208;modified l&#8208;Leu&#8208;based peptide {(3,5&#8208;diCF3Ph)NHC(=S)&#8208;(l&#8208;Leu&#8208;l&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ac5c)2&#8208;OMe} with five&#8208;membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acids (Ac5c) catalyzed a highly enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction between &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene and dimethyl malonate. The enantioselective reaction required only 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% chiral peptide&#8208;catalyst in the presence of iPr2EtN (2.5&#8197;equiv.), and gave a 1,4&#8208;adduct with 93&#8201;% ee of an 85&#8201;% yield. As Michael acceptors, various &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene derivatives such as methyl, p&#8208;fluoro, p&#8208;bromo, and p&#8208;methoxy substituents on the phenyl group, 2&#8208;furyl, 2&#8208;thiophenyl, and naphthyl &#946;&#8208;nitroethylenes could be applied. Furthermore, various alkyl malonates and cyclic &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;esters could be used as Michael donors. It became clear that the length of the peptide chain, a right&#8208;handed helical structure, amide N&#8722;Hs, and the N&#8208;terminal thiourea moiety play crucial roles in asymmetric induction.

         <title>Ultrafast Photo&#8208;ion Probing of the Ring&#8208;Opening Process in Trans&#8208;Stilbene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sub&#8208;picosecond studies of the excited&#8208;state ring&#8208;opening dynamics of stilbene oxide are presented. Three major decays for the parent ion (sub&#8208;450&#8197;fs, (1.5&#177;0.2)&#8197;ps, and &gt;100&#8197;ps), which relate to ring opening at the C&#8722;C bond of the oxirane center, were observed. Additionally two fragment ions appeared that might highlight an alternative mechanism that occurs through the dissociation of one of the C&#8722;O bonds of the oxirane center.







Abstract
The ultrafast photo&#8208;induced ring opening of the oxirane derivative trans&#8208;stilbene oxide has been studied through the use of ultrafast UV/UV pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy by using photo&#8208;ion detection. Single&#8208; and multiphoton probe paths and final states were identified through comparisons between UV power studies and synchrotron&#8208;based vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single&#8208;photon ionization studies. Three major time&#8208;dependent features of the parent ion (sub&#8208;450&#8197;fs decay, (1.5&#177;0.2)&#8197;ps, and &gt;100&#8197;ps) were observed. These decays are discussed in conjunction with the primary ring&#8208;opening mechanism of stilbene oxide, which occurs through C&#8722;C dissociation in the oxirane ring. The appearance of fragments relating to the masses of dehydrogenated diphenylmethane (167&#8197;amu) and dehydrogenated methylbenzene (90&#8197;amu) were also investigated. The appearance of the 167&#8197;amu fragment could suggest an alternative ultrafast ring&#8208;opening pathway via the dissociation of one of the C&#8722;O bonds within the oxirane ring.

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite with Significantly Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered as a green metallic corrosion protection technology, which uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials. A CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared in this work, and its photoelectrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO 3  has a well band matching with CdIn 2  S 4  , leading to a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical CP performance of the CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered as a green metallic corrosion protection technology, which uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials. A CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared in this work, and its photoelectrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO 3  has a well band matching with CdIn 2  S 4  , leading to a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical CP performance of the CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination by intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of W element, and it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals.

         <title>Fabrication of Pd/Mg2P2O7 via a Struvite&#8208;Template Way from Wastewater and Application as Chemoselective Catalyst in Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes</title>

One man&#8216;s trash is another man&#8216;s treasure: A novel template strategy allows fibrous struvite&#8212;a composite Pd/Mg2P2O7 with a mesoporous structure and an ultrahigh surface area&#8212;to be synthesized from wastewater. The prepared Pd/Mg2P2O7 nanowires showed excellent performance in the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes. This strategy provided a new pathway for synthesizing highly efficient catalysts as well as a solution for alleviate eutrophic pollution caused by N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing substances in wastewater.







Abstract
A highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst Pd/Mg2P2O7 was fabricated by combining palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) and mesoporous Mg2P2O7 fibers/rods. Mg2P2O7 fibers with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area were prepared from struvite as templates, which were synthesized from waste water containing N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing pollutants. This strategy provided a novel pathway for developing advanced catalysts from eutrophication&#8208;polluted water. The composite Pd/Mg2P2O7 showed brilliant performance in selective hydrogenation of nitro aromatics to give anilines. As an example of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, the conversion to aniline and selectivity were found to reach almost 100&#8201;% at a temperature of T=90&#8201;&#176;C and under a pressure of P
=2.0&#8197;MPa. The superior performance was found to originate from PdNPs, which were boosted by electron transfer afforded by the nanofiber Mg2P2O7 supports. The favorable adsorption of withdrawing groups (&#8722;NO2) was realized by synergistic effects between Pd and oxygen vacancies provided by pyrolysis of struvite. The catalyst remained stable after cycles of reuse with little degradation in catalytic performance.

         <title>Janus Pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;Dipyrrin: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Assemblies and Slow Magnetic Relaxation of the Cobalt(II) Complex in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin (  Janus&#8208;PPAD  ) with Janus duality was synthesized by a Schiff base forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole. The orthogonal interactions of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties in  Janus&#8208;PPAD  enabled arrangement of metal ions at regular intervals: zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination provided metal&#8208;coordinated  Janus&#8208;PPAD  dimers, which can subsequently form hydrogen&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional arrays both in solution and in the solid state. The supramolecular assembly formation of the zinc(II) complex in solution was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on the isodesmic model, in which a binding constant for the elongation of assemblies is constant. In the solid state, owing to the tetrahedral coordination, the cobalt(II) complex exhibited a slow magnetic relaxation due to the negative  D  value of &#8722;27.1 cm  &#8722;1  with the effective relaxation energy barrier  U  eff  &#160;of 38.0 cm  &#8211;1  . The effect of magnetic dilution on the relaxation behavior is discussed. The relaxation mechanism in the low temperature range was analyzed by considering spin lattice interactions and quantum tunneling effects. The easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy was confirmed, and the relevant wave functions were obtained by ab initio CASSCF calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Halogen Exchange of Trifluoromethyl Arenes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of synthetically valuable ArCF2X and ArCX3 compounds from ArCF3 using catalytic iron(III)halides is described, which constitutes the first iron&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of non&#8208;aromatic C&#8722;F bonds. Theoretical calculations suggest direct activation of C&#8722;F bonds by iron coordination. To optimize for mono&#8208;exchange, a statistical analysis called Design of Experiments was used. Optimized parameters were successfully applied to both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic substrates, and to the late&#8208;stage diversification of flufenoxuron, a commercial insecticide.







Abstract
The facile production of ArCF2X and ArCX3 from ArCF3 using catalytic iron(III)halides is reported, which constitutes the first iron&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange for non&#8208;aromatic C&#8722;F bonds. Theoretical calculations suggest direct activation of C&#8722;F bonds by iron coordination. ArCX3 and ArCF2X products of the reaction are synthetically valuable due to their diversification potential. In particular, chloro&#8208; and bromodifluoromethyl arenes (ArCF2Cl, ArCF2Br respectively) provide access to a myriad of difluoromethyl arene derivatives (ArCF2R). To optimize for mono&#8208;halogen exchange, a statistical method called Design of Experiments was used. Optimized parameters were successfully applied to electron rich and electron deficient aromatic substrates, and to the late stage diversification of flufenoxuron, a commercial insecticide. These methods are highly practical, being run at convenient temperatures and using inexpensive common reagents.

         <title>Binding Insights into Quadruplex Selective Carbazole Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary DNA structures have received increasing attention in medicinal chemistry owing to their key involvement in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere length homeostasis and transcription of important proto&#8208;oncogenes. Different classes of G4 ligands have been developed for the potential treatment of several human diseases. Among them, the carbazole scaffold with appropriate side chain appendages has attracted much interest for designing G4 ligands. Because of its large and rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugation system and ease of functionalization at three different positions, a variety of carbazole derivatives have been synthesized from various natural or synthetic sources for potential applications in G4&#8208;based therapeutics and biosensors.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polymorphic G-quadruplex (G4) secondary DNA structures have received increasing attention in medicinal chemistry owing to their key involvement in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere length homeostasis and transcription of important proto-oncogenes. Different classes of G4 ligands have been developed for the potential treatment of several human diseases. Among them, the carbazole scaffold with appropriate side chain appendages has attracted much interest for designing G4 ligands. Because of its large and rigid &#960;-conjugation system and ease of functionalization at three different positions, a variety of carbazole derivatives have been synthesized from various natural or synthetic sources for potential applications in G4-based therapeutics and biosensors. Herein, we provide an updated close-up of the literatures on carbazole-based G4 ligands with particular focus given on their detailed binding insights studied by NMR spectroscopy. The structure-activity relationships and the opportunities and challenges of their potential applications as biosensors and therapeutics are also discussed. This review will provide an overall picture of carbazole ligands with remarkable G4 topological preference, fluorescence properties and significant bioactivity; portraying carbazole as a very promising scaffold for assembling G4 ligands with a range of novel functional applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis Using Heterogenized Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogenized photoredox catalysts provide a path for sustainable chemical synthesis using highly tunable, reusable constructs. Here, heterogenized iridium complexes as photoredox catalysts were assembled via covalent attachment to metal oxide surfaces (ITO, ZrO2  , Al2  O3  ) in thin film or nanopowder constructs. The goal was to understand which materials provided the most promising constructs for catalysis. &#160;To do this, reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as a test reaction for system optimization. All catalyst constructs produced acetophenone with high conversions and yields with the fastest reactions complete in fifteen minutes using Al  2  O  3  supports. The nanopowder catalysts resulted in faster and more efficient catalysis, while the thin film catalysts were more robust and easily reused. Importantly, the thin film constructs show promise for future photoelectrochemical and electrochemical photoredox setups. Finally, all catalysts were reusable 2&#8208;3 times, performing at least 1000 turnovers (Al2O3  ), demonstrating that heterogenized catalysts are a sustainable catalyst alternative.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionization and Photofragmentation of Isolated Metalloporphyrin Cations Investigated by VUV Action Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigated the photoionization and fragmentation of isolated metal protoporphyrin IX cations (MPPIX with M&#160;= Fe, Co, Zn) by means of VUV action spectroscopy in the energy range of 8.5&#8208;35 eV. Experiments were carried out in the gas phase by interfacing an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer with a synchrotron beamline. The mass spectra and partial ion yields show that photoexcitation of the precursor ions predominantly leads to  &#8226;  CH  2  COOH radical side&#8208;chain losses of the macrocycle with additional methyl radical (  &#8226;  CH  3  ) side&#8208;chain losses. Ionization, in contrast, leads to the formation of the intact ionized precursor and various doubly charged fragments which are mostly due to side&#8208;chain cleavages. Although statistical fragmentation dominates, we found evidence for non&#8208;statistical processes such as new fragments involving e.g. single and double H  2  O losses, indicating that different relaxation mechanisms are at play upon photoionization compared to photoexcitation. The measured ionization energies were 9.6 &#177; 0.2 eV, 9.4 &#177; 0.2 eV and 9.6 &#177; 0.2 eV for FePPIX  +  , CoPPIX  +  and ZnPPIX  +  , respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;Based Brucite&#8208;Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urge for carbon&#8208;neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite&#8208;type materials as low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite&#8208;type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth&#8208;abundant Fe  3+  containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe  3+  rich Co&#8208;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite&#8208;like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite&#8208;type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)  2  without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  (  &#951;  = 0.34 V) and medium current densities of 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  (  &#951;  = 0.40 V) compared to the corresponding brucite&#8208;type hydroxides and LDH materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Acylhydrazone Sub&#8208;Units as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reimagined concept of long&#8208;range tautomeric proton transfer using crane sub&#8208;units has been presented by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (7&#8208;OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone sub&#8208;units attached to the 7&#8208;OHQ at 8th position act as a crane arm for proton cargo delivery to the quinoline nitrogen. Light&#8208;induced tautomerization to their keto tautomers leads to Z/E isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent or hydrogen bond formation. The axle being either imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8208;CH3 group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathway. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tunable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated, which results in E/Z configurational switching of the acylhydrazone sub&#8208;units. This was proven by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterodinuclear Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III) with Na(I) Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide and Cyclohexene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series heterodinuclear catalysts, operating without co&#8208;catalyst, show good performances for the ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The complexes feature a macrocyclic ligand designed to coordinate metals such as Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III), in a Schiff base &#8216;pocket&#8217;, and Na(I) in a modified crown&#8208;ether binding &#8216;pocket&#8217;. The 11 new catalysts are used to explore the influences of the metal combinations and ligand backbones over catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N, N'&#8208;bis(3,3&#8217;&#8208;triethylene glycol salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1 bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 1590 h&#8208;1, &gt;99% polymer selectivity, 1:10: 4000, 100 &#186;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 4343 h&#8208;1, 20 bar, 1:10:25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10&#8208;40 bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co&#8208;catalyst rather earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal delivers efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well&#8208;designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Perylene Bisimide Dyes by Interlocked Arene Substituents in the Bay Area</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes bearing various aryl substituents in 1,6,7,12 bay positions has been synthesized by Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction. These molecules exhibit an exceptionally large and conformationally fixed twist angle of the PBI  &#960;&#8208;  core due to the high steric congestion imparted by the aryl substituents in bay positions. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of phenyl&#8208;, naphthyl&#8208; and pyrenyl&#8208;functionalized PBIs reveal interlocked  &#960;&#8209;&#960;  &#8209;stacking motifs, leading to conformational chirality and the possibility for the isolation of enantiopure atropoisomers by semipreparative HPLC chromatography. The interlocked arrangement endows these molecules with substantial racemization barriers of about 120&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8209;1  for the tetraphenyl&#8208; and tetra&#8208;2&#8209;naphthyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, which is among the highest racemization barriers for axially chiral PBIs. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal the presence of a multitude of up to fourteen conformational isomers in solution that are interconverted via smaller activation barriers of about 65 kJ&#160;mol  &#8209;1  . The redox and optical properties of these core&#8208;twisted PBIs have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy and their respective atropoenantiomers were further characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Cysteine and Aminopeptidase N using meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>meso&#8208;Carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, 1a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (1a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively. The aromatic (1a) and aliphatic (4) thioesters of meso&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte&#8208;induced conversion to the meso&#8208;amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe 1a exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction. Probe 4 was successfully applied to the monitoring and imaging of endogenous aminopeptidase N in live cancer cells.</dc:description>

&#8220;Advanced technology for reaction prediction is extremely desirable for the development of new methodologies in organic chemistry. The present study represents the Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method in combination with the Global Reaction Route Mapping (GRRM) program, which has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting reaction pathways. It has enabled us to develop a new three&#8208;component reaction of amines, difluorocarbene, and CO2 that leads to new fluorinated glycine derivatives (&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine) with a broad substrate scope and synthetic applications.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <dc:description>This review highlights the major efforts devoted to the development of molecular gears over the past forty years, from the pioneering covalent bis&#8208;triptycyl systems undergoing intramolecular correlated rotation in solution, to the most recent examples of gearing systems anchored on a surface, allowing for intermolecular transmission of mechanical power. Emphasis is laid on the different strategies devised progressively to control the architectures of molecular bevel and spur gears, as intramolecular systems in solution or intermolecular systems on surfaces, while aiming at increased efficiency, complexity and functionality.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In particular, inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox&#8208;active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high&#8208;potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, we evaluate the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4&#8208;bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities. The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed. Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramethoxy&#8208;  o  &#8208;terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of  N  &#8208;ethylcarbazole to give  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2&#8208;&#8203;[(4&#8208;&#8203;methoxyphenyl)&#8203;methyl]&#8203;&#8208;benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high&#8208;potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.</dc:description>

Redox-active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high-potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions.

The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum-chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed.

         <title>Labeling and Probing the Silica Surface Using Mechanochemistry and 17O NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost&#8208;efficient, fast, and user&#8208;friendly  17  O enrichment protocols to help understand the structure and reactivity of materials using  17  O NMR. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at the industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15 min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High&#8208;precision  17  O&#8208;compositions were measured at different milling times using&#160;large&#8208;geometry secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160; LG&#8208;SIMS. High&#8208;resolution  17  O NMR analyses (including at 35.2 T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si) and silanols (Si&#8208;OH), while DNP analyses, performed using direct  17  O polarization and indirect  17  O{  1  H} CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8208;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D  1  H&#8208;  17  O D&#8208;HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface&#8208;labeled silica was reacted with titania and using  17  O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8208;O&#8208;Ti bonds identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3,8,10&#8208;Tetrasubstituted peropyrenes were synthesized via a reductive aromatization and functionalization strategy. Finetuning of their optoelectronic properties was monitored by UV&#8208;Vis, PL, XRD, CV, and DFT methods.







Abstract
The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (2,3), pivaloyl (4), triflyl (5) and also phosphinite (6) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using 4 and 5 in transition metal catalysed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (8&#8208;11) and tetraalkynyl (7) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.

         <title>Study of Ground State Interactions of Enantiopure Chiral Quaternary Ammonium Salts and Amides, Nitroalkanes, Nitroalkenes, Esters, Heterocycles, Ketones and Fluoroamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments were carried out on Cinchona and Maruoka type quaternary ammonium salts, by using neutral ligands. The data clarified the principal interactions involved between catalyst and reactants, showed the binding of halides and non&#8208;coordinating anion BArF to chiral ammonium species, and provided a guide to understanding the enantioselective processes mediated by this class of organocatalysts.







Abstract
Chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalysis provides high level of enantiocontrol, however no experimental data showed the interaction of catalysts and substrates. 1H&#8197;NMR titration was carried out on Cinchona and Maruoka ammonium bromides vs. nitro, carbonyl, heterocycles, and N&#8722;F containing compounds. It was found that neutral organic species and quaternary ammonium salts interacted via an ensemble of catalyst +N&#8722;C&#8722;H and (sp2)C&#8722;H, specific for each substrate studied. The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls via a diverse set of +N&#8722;C&#8722;H and (sp2)C&#8722;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, through specific C&#8722;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric structural and functional design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to construct various COFs with tailor&#8208;made properties. Regular arrangements of donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties in D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides abundant pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on the design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect has been widely studied in both small molecules and linear polymers. Covalently&#8208;bonded donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with tunable bandgaps and photoelectric properties endow these materials with potential applications in optoelectronics, fluorescent bioimaging, and sensors, etc. However, owing to the lack of charge transfer pathway or effective separation of charge carriers, unfavorable charge recombination gives rise to inevitable energy loss. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments are connected by covalent bonds and can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8722;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenation of Chiral Nitroalkanes: An Easy Entry to &#945;&#8208;Substituted Enantiomerically Enriched Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective divergent methodology for the reduction of aliphatic nitro compounds into nitriles and amines has been developed. The protocol efficiently affords optically active nitriles starting from chiral nitroalkanes. In the reaction inexpensive bulk chemicals are employed and the use of heavy metals is precluded, thereby excluding potential contamination of the product by metal impurities.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes has been developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes were selectively converted into amines or nitriles. Furthermore, when chiral &#946;&#8208;substituted nitro compounds were reacted, the stereochemical integrity of the stereocenter was maintained and &#945;&#8208;functionalized nitriles were obtained with no loss of enantiomeric excess. The methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, and TBS&#8208;protected cyanohydrins, including direct precursors of four active pharmaceutical ingredients (ibuprofen, tembamide, aegeline and denopamine).

         <title>Oxyphosphonium Enolate Equilibria in a (4+1)&#8208;Cycloaddition Approach toward Quaternary C3&#8208;Spirooxindole Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected balancing act! The efficient phosphorus&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot formal (4+1)&#8208;cycloaddition between an in&#8197;situ generated oxyphosphonium enolate and an ortho&#8208;quinone methide provides spirooxindole benzofurans in appreciable yields and diastereoselectivity despite a delicate balance of intermediate equilibria.







Abstract
An efficient and convergent (4+1)&#8208;cycloaddition strategy toward the construction of spirooxindole benzofurans that involves the intermediacy of an isatin&#8208;derived oxyphosphonium enolate is presented. Mechanistic investigations employing in&#8197;situ NMR analysis of the reaction mixture revealed a correlation between phosphonium enolate structure and product distribution that was heavily influenced by the solvent and reaction temperature.

         <title>Single&#8208;Round DNA Aptamer Selection by Combined Use of Capillary Electrophoresis and Next Generation Sequencing: An Aptaomics Approach for Identifying Unique Functional Protein&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; is reported in this work for finding functional DNA aptamers by a semi&#8208;comprehensive and quantitative single&#8208;round selection using capillary electrophoresis and next generation sequencing according to a selection rule based on analogous sequences. By mining sequence data obtained from sub&#8208;libraries with different DNA conformations, structure&#8208;induced (FRET type) aptamers for thrombin were reasonably selected for the first time. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Saito et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100177).

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a joint endeavor, a ruthenium catalyst and a catalytic amine enable the deuteration of aromatic aldehydes and ketones using cheap and convenient D2O as deuterium source. The amine serves as a transient directing group, forming imines in situ and thus facilitating coordination of the ruthenium catalyst to the substrates. The practical applicability of this novel methodology is demonstrated by the successful deuteration of a range of (hetero)aromatic carbonyl compounds as well as pharmaceuticals. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Neumann, M. Beller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100468).

         <dc:description>
The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reactions is central to advance DNA&#8208;encoded library technology. Amphiphilic block copolymer micelles functionalized with sulfonic acid moieties assemble in water to micelles and localize the catalyst in them. DNA&#8208;aldehyde conjugates were reacted to target heterocycles by micelle&#8208;promoted Povarov&#8208; and Biginelli&#8208;reaction with minimal DNA damage. Strikingly, DNA&#8208;conjugates accumulated effectively in the micellar compartments as a prerequisite for compound synthesis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Weberskirch, A. Brunschweiger, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100980).

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and Its Two&#8208;Sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;two&#8208;sided nature&#8221; of the Ia3d gyroid&#8208;type bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (Cubbi LC) phase of a nonsymmetric core molecule is depicted in the cover image. Two core assembly modes specific to each symmetric molecule with larger naphthalene or smaller benzene cores appear to form the three&#8208;dimensional helical network, depending on temperature and thermal cycle. The finding reveals that the core symmetry can control the core packing and stability of the network structure. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Kutsumizu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101233).

         <title>A Fluorescence Sensor Array Based on Zinc(II)&#8208;carboxyamidoquinolines: Toward Quantitative Detection of ATP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (  1  &#8211;  3  ) and their Zn(II) complexes (  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  ) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence.  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  assemblies bind adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte&#8208;specific response. This process was investigated using UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enables differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi) and phosphate (Pi). The cross&#8208;reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines&#8208;Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) with 100% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range 5&#8208;100 &#181;M concentration in unknown samples with error &lt; 2.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Modulation of Pt&#8208;group Metals and Electrocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable development orientation of de&#8208;fossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion modulated strategy for Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy the future green electrochemical energy conversion system. Based on the previous work of our group and others, in this review, we summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) in energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis from activity origin and synthetic strategies to electrochemical applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In the end, the key problems, countermeasures and future development orientations of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds toward electrocatalytic applications are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Hidden Landscape of Tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) Ligands: Topological Complexity Derived from the Bridgehead</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular main group chemistry is a developing field which parallels the conventional domain of metallo&#8208;organic chemistry. Little explored building blocks in this area are main group metal&#8208;based ligands which have the appropriate donor symmetry to build desired molecular or extended arrangements. Tris(pyridyl) main group ligands (E(py) 3 , E = main group metal) are potentially highly versatile building blocks since shifting the N&#8208;donor arms from the 2&#8208; to the 3&#8208;positions and 4&#8208;positions provides a very simple way of changing the ligand character from mononuclear/chelating to multidentate/metal&#8208;bridging. Here we explore the coordination behaviour of the first main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands, E(4&#8208;py) 3 (E = Sb, Bi, Sn), and their ability to build metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The complicated topology of these MOFs shows a marked influence on the counter anion and on the ability of the E(4&#8208;py) 3 ligands to switch coordination mode, depending on the steric and donor character of the bridgehead. This structure&#8208;directing influence of the bridgehead provides a potential building strategy for future molecular and MOF design in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies of Si/C Composite Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li  2  TiO  3  materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, becomes a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the research progress of Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon based materials is researched, where the influences of carbons on the property modulation of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.</dc:description>

Putting another coat on: CeCoOx catalysts with different core&#8208;shell compositions and structures have been prepared for o&#8208;DCB catalytic combustion. Coating the catalysts with Nb2O5 could greatly improve their activity. Moreover, TiO2 protected the Ce from inactivation by Cl deposition. This gave them good thermal and hydrothermal stabilities in addition to their catalytic activity.







Abstract
A series of catalysts with different core&#8208;shell structures has been successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method. They consisted of CeCoOx@TiO2 (single shell), CeCoOx@Nb2O5 (single shell) and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 (double shell) core&#8208;shell nanocages and CeCoOx nanocages, in which CeCoOx was the core and TiO2 and Nb2O5 were shells. The influence of the core&#8208;shell structure on the catalytic performance of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene was investigated by activity, water&#8208;resistance, and thermal stability tests as well as catalyst characterization. The temperatures corresponding to 90&#8201;% conversion of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (T90) of CeCoOx, CeCoOx@TiO2, CeCoOx@Nb2O5, and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts were 415, 383, 362 and 367&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. CeCoOx@Nb2O5 exhibited excellent catalytic activity, mainly owing to the special core&#8208;shell structure, large specific surface area, abundant activity of Co3+, Ce3+, Nb5+, strong reducibility, and more active oxygen vacancies. It can be seen that the Nb2O5 coating can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In addition, due to the protective effect of the TiO2 shell on CeCoOx, CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts exhibited outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability for 20&#8197;hours. The T90 of CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 was slightly lower than that of CeCoOx@Nb2O5, but it had higher stability and hydrothermal stability. Furthermore, possible reaction pathways involving the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (MvK) and Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) models were deduced based on studies of the temperature&#8208;programmed desorption of O2 (O2&#8208;TPD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization.

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd  0  , Pd  II  and Pd  IV  species to catalyze four distinct processes: (1) aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling. DFT calculations revealed that 1,5&#8208;Pd migration likely proceeds via both concerted Pd  II  and stepwise Pd  IV  routes. Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Cationic Polypeptide Supramolecular Nanogels for Intracellular DNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular nanogels are an emerging class of polymer nanocarriers for intracellular delivery, owing to their straightforward preparation, biocompatibility, and capability to spontaneously encapsulate biologically active components such as DNA. A completely biodegradable three component cationic supramolecular nanogel was designed exploiting the multivalent host&#8208;guest interaction of cyclodextrin and adamantane attached to a polypeptide backbone. While cyclodextrin was conjugated to linear poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, adamantane was grafted to linear as well as star shaped poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. Size control of nanogels was obtained with the increase in the length of the host and guest polymer. Moreover, smaller nanogels were obtained using the star shaped polymers because of the compact nature of star polymers compared to linear ones. Nanogels were loaded with anionic model cargoes, pyranine and carboxyfluorescein, and their enzyme responsive release was studied using protease trypsin. Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.</dc:description>

Here we show that, in spite of this ferryl oxidant having the &#8220;wrong&#8221; spin ground state, it is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of a similar order of reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes (C&#8208;H abstraction of cyclohexane, &#8208; 90 &#176;C (propionitrile),  t  1/2  = 3.5 sec). Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis, which indicate that substrate oxidation is significantly faster than self&#8208;decay processes due to an intramolecular demethylation pathway and formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediate. It is also shown that the iron(III)&#8208;hydroxido / cyclohexyl radical intermediate, resulting from C&#8208;H abstraction, selectively produces chlorocyclohexane in a rebound process. However, the life&#8208;time of the intermediate is so long that other reaction channels (known as cage escape) become important, and much of the C&#8208;H abstraction therefore is unproductive. In bulk reactions at ambient temperature and at longer time scales, there is formation of significant amounts of oxidation product &#8211; specifically of chlorocyclohexane, and it is shown that this originates from oxidation of the oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;penetrating Mitochondria&#8208;targeting Ligands for Universal Delivery of Small Molecules, Proteins and Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria are key organelles that perform vital cellular functions such as cell survival and death. Targeted delivery of different types of cargos to mitochondria is a well&#8208;established strategy to study mitochondrial biology and diseases. Of various existing mitochondria&#8208;transporting vehicles, most of them suffered from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins and nanomaterials). Herein, we disclose two new cell&#8208;penetrating mitochondria&#8208;targeting ligands (named MitoLigand), as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry, that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small&#8208; molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well&#8208;known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to cell apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondria&#8208;targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine substituents in transition metal catalysts are of significantly great importance in olefin polymerization catalysis; however, the comprehensive effect of fluorine substituents is elusive in seminal late transition metal a&#8208;diimine catalytic system. In this contribution, fluorine substituents at various positions (  ortho  &#8208;,  meta  &#8208;, and  para  &#8208;F) and with different numbers (F  n  ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5) were installed into the well&#8208;defined  N  &#8208;terphenyl amine and thus were studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomers. The position of the fluorine substituent was particularly crucial in these polymerization reactions in terms of catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer, and thus a picture on the fluorine effect was given. As a notable result, the  ortho  &#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalyst produced highly linear polyethylenes with an extremely high molecular weight (  M  w  = 8,703 kDa) and a significantly low degree of branching of 1.4/1000 C; however, the  meta  &#8208;F and/or  para  &#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts generated highly branched (up to 80.2/1000 C) polyethylenes with significantly low molecular weights (  M  w  = 20&#8208;50 kDa).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Labeled RNAs are invaluable probes for investigation of RNA function and localization. However, mRNA labeling remains challenging. Here, we developed an improved method for 3&#8242;&#8208;end labeling of in vitro transcribed RNAs. We synthesized novel adenosine 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;bisphosphate analogs modified at the N6 or C2 position of adenosine with an azide&#8208;containing linker, fluorescent label, or biotin and assessed these constructs as substrates for RNA labeling directly by T4 ligase or via postenzymatic strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). All analogs were substrates for T4 RNA ligase. Analogs containing bulky fluorescent labels or biotin showed better overall labeling yields than postenzymatic SPAAC. We successfully labeled uncapped RNAs, NAD&#8208;capped RNAs, and 5&#8242;&#8208;fluorescently labeled m 7 Gp 3 A m &#8208;capped mRNAs. The obtained highly homogenous dually labeled mRNA was translationally active and enabled fluorescence&#8208;based monitoring of decapping. This method will facilitate the use of various functionalized mRNA&#8208;based probes.</dc:description>

         <title>PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) Heterostructured Nanobundles as Advanced Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the electronic and synergistic effect of hybrid electrocatalysts based on Pt and Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is of tremendous importance towards a superior  hydrogen evolution  performance under both acidic and alkaline conditions. However, developing an ideal Pt&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst with moderated electronic structure as well as strong synergistic effect is still a challenge. Herein, we fabricated boron (B)&#8208;doped PtNi nanobundles by a two&#8208;step method using NaBH  4  as the boron resource to obtain PtNi/Ni  4  B  3  heterostructures with well&#8208;defined nanointerfaces between PtNi and Ni  4  B  3  , achieving an enhanced catalytic HER performance. Specially, the PtNi/Ni  4  B  3  nanobundles (PtNi/Ni  4  B  3  NBs) can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  at the overpotential of 14.6 and 26.5 mV under alkaline and acidic media, respectively, as well as outstanding electrochemical stability over 40 h at the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  . Remarkably, this approach is also universal for the syntheses of PtCo/Co  3  B and PtFe/Fe  49  B with outstanding electroatalytic HER performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation is a highly challenging process as a consequence of their similar physicochemical properties. In this work we have explored, by static and dynamic gas sorption techniques and computational modelling, the suitability of a series of two isoreticular robust Ni(II)pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones, for C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation. The results are consistent with high adsorption capacity and selectivity of the essayed systems towards C  2  H  2  molecules. Furthermore, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment with KOH ethanolic solution give rise to linker vacancy defects and incorporation of extraframework potassium ions. Creation of defects is responsible for increased adsorption capacity for both gases, however, strong interactions of the cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO  2  molecules are responsible for a lowering of C  2  H  2  over CO  2  selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid and Compact Binuclear Bis&#8208;hydrated Gd&#8208;complexes as High Relaxivity MRI Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first binuclear Gd&#8208;complex of the 12&#8208;membered pyridine&#8208;based polyaminocarboxylate macrocyclic ligand PCTA was synthesized by C&#8208;C connection of the pyridine units through two different synthetic procedures. A dimeric AAZTA&#8208;ligand was also synthesized with the aim to compare the relaxometric results or the two ditopic Gd&#8208;complexes. Thus, the  1  H relaxometric study on [Gd  2  PCTA  2  (H  2  O)  4  ] and for [Gd  2  AAZTA  2  (H  2  O)  4  ]  2&#8208;  highlighted the remarkable rigidity and compactness of the two binuclear complexes, which results in molar relaxivities (per Gd), at 1.5 T and 298 K of ca. 12&#8208;12.6 mM  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  with an increase of ca. 80% at 1.5 T and 298 K (+70% at 310 K) with respect to the corresponding mononuclear complexes.</dc:description>
