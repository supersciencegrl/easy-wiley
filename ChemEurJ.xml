         <title>Understanding Flexdispersion: Structure&#8211;Function Relationship Studies of Organic Amphiphilic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since inorganic nanoparticles have unique properties that differ from bulk materials, their material applications have attracted attention in various fields. In order to utilize inorganic nanoparticles for functional materials, they must be dispersed without agglomeration. Therefore, the surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles are typically modified with organic ligands to improve their dispersibility. Nevertheless, the relationship between the tail group structure in organic ligands and the dispersibility of inorganic nanoparticles in organic solvents remains poorly understood. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. However, the structural requirements for amphiphilic ligands to &#8220;flexibly&#8221; disperse nanoparticles in less polar to polar solvents are still unclear. Here, we designed and synthesized several phosphonic acid ligands for structure&#8210;function relationship studies of flexdispersion. Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements revealed that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains in organic ligands alone does not determine the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in organic solvents, but the arrangement of the individual chains also has an effect. From a practical application standpoint, it is preferable to design ligands with ethylene glycol chains on the outside relative to the particle surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Electrolytes: Design Principles and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Today, rechargeable batteries are omnipresent and essential for our existence. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of electric fields, the introduction of electrolytes with fluorine (F)&#8208;based inorganic elemental compositions is a direction of exploration. However, most fluorocarbons have a high global warming potential and ozone depletion potential, which do not meet the sustainability requirements of the battery industry. Therefore, developing sustainable electrolytes is a viable option for future battery development. Although researchers have made much progress in electrolyte optimization, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. This review aims to elucidate the design principles and recent advances in this direction for solvents and salts. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of green electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Blue Photo&#8208; and Electroluminescence from CF3&#8208;Decorated Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organometallic complexes of earth&#8208;abundant copper(I) have long been studied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). Particularly, Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have recently emerged as promising organometallic emitters. However, blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA complexes have been rarely reported. Here we constructed two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA emitters, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz and MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz, by introducing one or two CF3&#8208; substitutes into carbazole ligands. Both complexes exhibited high thermal stability and blue emission colors. Moreover, two complexes exhibited different emission origins rooting from different donor ligands: a distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz or a dominant phosphorescence nature from local triplet excited state of the carbazole ligand for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz. Inspiringly, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz had high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 94% and short emission lifetimes of down to 1.2 &#956;s in doped films, accompanied by relatively high radiative rates in the 105 s&#8722;1 order. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz delivered pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 462 nm together with a high external quantum efficiency of 13.0%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocontrolled Binding of Styrylnaphthyridine Ligands to Abasic Site&#8208;Containing DNA by Reversible [2+2] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrylnaphthyridine derivatives are shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA). The ligand can be formed from its photodimer in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a promising tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder.







Abstract
Five novel styrylnaphthyridine derivatives were synthesized and shown to operate as photoswitchable, selective ligands for abasic site&#8208;containing DNA (AP&#8208;DNA), which is an important therapeutic and diagnostic target. These compounds associate with AP&#8208;DNA with binding constants of 0.5&#8211;8.4&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 as shown by photometric and fluorimetric titrations. Specifically, these ligands bind preferentially to AP&#8208;DNA relative to regularly paired duplex DNA. As a special feature, the association of these ligands with DNA can be controlled by means of a reversible [2+2] photocycloaddition. Upon irradiation at 420&#8197;nm the photodimer is formed, which does not bind to AP&#8208;DNA. In turn, the naphthyridine is regained with excitation at 315&#8197;nm. Most notably, this photoinduced deactivation and release of the DNA ligand can be performed in&#8197;situ in the presence of AP&#8208;DNA, thus providing a tool for on&#8208;demand delivery of a DNA binder. Overall, these results provide a promising starting point for the development of functional AP&#8208;DNA ligands whose bioactivity can be modulated by light with local and temporal control.

The first example of phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole&#8208;cored blue fluorophore with HLCT feature was reported. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped pure blue OLEDs demonstrated the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with the maximum EQE of 7.99&#8201;% accompanied with negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, even maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
It is vital to develop highly efficient non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off for applications in display and lighting. Herein, two blue D&#8208;A fluorophores TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO are designed and synthesized, in which phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]oxazole (PO) acts as the acceptor and triphenylamine as the donor. TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO display good thermal stability and efficient luminescence efficiency in neat film. Results based on photophysical property and theoretical calculation demonstrate that TPA&#8208;PO and TPA&#8208;DPO possess the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, which can utilize the triplet exciton to achieve highly efficient electroluminance (EL). The non&#8208;doped OLEDs with TPA&#8208;PO/TPA&#8208;DPO as pure emissive layer show the uniform EL emission peak at 468&#8197;nm, corresponding to CIE coordinates of (0.168, 0.187) and (0.167, 0.167), respectively. The TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs provide the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.99&#8201;% and high exciton utility efficiency of 48.4&#8201;%~72.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the TPA&#8208;DPO&#8208;based device exhibits low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off, still maintaining the EQE of 6.03&#8201;% at the high luminance of 5000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Those findings state clearly that PO is a promising building block of blue fluorophore with a potential HLCT feature to be applied in non&#8208;doped OLEDs.

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Driven Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Trifluoromethylation of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex (EDA) complex&#8208;based method for trifluoromethylating heterocycles, bypassing traditional photocatalysts and oxidants. Utilizing 395&#8197;nm light, it efficiently produces trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. The research emphasizes EDA photoactivation&#8216;s crucial role, thoroughly documented through experimental, mechanistic, and spectroscopic analyses, thereby expanding EDA complexes&#8242; utility in chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Heterocyclic trifluoromethylation is efficiently initiated through a photochemical reaction utilizing an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, proceeding smoothly without the use of photocatalysts, transition&#8208;metal catalysts, or additional oxidants. This method has been optimized through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its versatility and efficacy across various substrates, including quinoxalinones, coumarins, and indolones. Notably, this approach enables the practical synthesis of trifluoromethylated quinoxalinones on a gram scale. Mechanistic investigations that incorporate radical trapping and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, confirmed the formation of the an EDA complex and elucidated the reaction pathways. This study highlights the crucial role of EDA photoactivation in trifluoromethylation, significantly expanding the application scope of EDA complexes in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Structure and Chiroptical Properties of Anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl Dimers as New Biaryls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomers of the title biaryl with one chiral axis and two helical moieties were resolved by chiral HPLC. Their chiroptical activities were evaluated by dissymmetry factors of the CD and CPL spectra. A stepwise mechanism of enantiomerization via rotation about the chiral axis was proposed by the DFT calculations.







Abstract
Dimers of anthra[1,2&#8208;a]anthracene&#8208;1&#8208;yl units and its mesityl derivative were synthesized by Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the corresponding chloro derivatives as new biaryls. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed that two polycyclic aromatic units with nonplanar deformations took a twisted conformation about the single bond as a chiral axis. Enantiomers of the nonsubstituted compound were resolved by chiral HPLC, and the enantiopure samples showed intense Cotton effects at 321&#8197;nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and emission bands at 449&#8197;nm in the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra with dissymmetry factor of |glum| 3.6&#215;10&#8722;3. The absolute stereochemistry of this biaryl was determined by the theoretical calculation of CD spectrum by the time&#8208;dependent DFT method. The barrier to enantiomerization was determined to be 108&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K. The dynamic process proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving the helical inversion of each aromatic unit and the rotation about the biaryl axis as analyzed by the DFT calculations.

         <title>Application of Mono and Trinuclear Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complexes in Differential Bacterial Imaging and Antimicrobial Photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of transition metal complexes for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an attractive alternative in mitigating a broad range of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In view of their photostability, long excited&#8208;state lifetimes, and tunable emission properties, transition metal complexes also contribute as bioimaging agents. In the present work, we designed mono and trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes to explore their imaging application and antibacterial potential.&#160; For this, we used Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the most prevalent of community&#8208;associated (CA) multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria (CA MDR) and Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) as Gram&#8208;positive while Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and E. coli as Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In addition to differential bioimaging of these bacteria, we assessed the antibacterial effects of both mono and trinuclear Ir(III) complexes under exposure to 427 nm LED light. The data presented herein strongly suggest better efficacy of trinuclear Ir(III) complex over mononuclear complex in imparting photoinduced cell death of MRSA. Based on the safety profile of these complexes, we propose that trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complex hold great promise for selective recognition and targeting MDR bacteria with minimal off&#8208;target effect.</dc:description>

This method grants access to a range of&#160;functionalised&#160;hydrocarbons in excellent yields and can be upgraded to catalytic regimes when using&#160;trans&#8208;stilbene, a 10 mol% of the alkyl sodium base and toluene as a solvent. Extending this approach to aromatic ketones leads to the formation of stilbenes under mild reaction conditions, resulting from the deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones. Combining spectroscopic studies with the trapping and&#160;characterisation&#160;of key reaction intermediates, mechanistic insights have been gained, advancing the understanding of coordination effects in organosodium chemistry, and shedding light on their special reactivity profiles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones.

         <title>Optical Upconversion in Mononuclear Lanthanide Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we developed two kinds of co&#8208;crystal assemblies systems, consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb3+ and Er3+ and mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+, which can achieve Er3+ and Pr3+ upconversion luminescence, respectively, by Yb3+ sensitization under 980 nm excitation. The structure and composition of two co&#8208;crystal assemblies were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. By investigation of the series of two assemblies, respectively, it is found that the strongest upconversion luminescence is both obtained when the molar ratio of Yb3+ and Ln3+ (Ln = Er or Pr) is 1 : 1. The energy transfer mechanism of Er3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion, while that of Pr3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion and cooperative sensitization upconversion. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension at room temperature, which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Cell 19F&#8197;NMR of Proteins: Recent Progress and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;cell 19F&#8197;NMR methodology has been proved as a practical tool for investigating the conformations, dynamics and interactions of biomacromolecules. Herein, we review its unique benefits, recent progress of sample preparation and application in this field. Based on their in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo studies, we also provide the future directions and outlook.







Abstract
In vitro, 19F&#8197;NMR methodology is preferably selected as a complementary and straightforward method for unveiling the conformations, dynamics, and interactions of biological molecules. Its effectiveness in&#8197;vivo has seen continuous improvement, addressing challenges faced by conventional heteronuclear NMR experiments on structured proteins, such as severe line broadening, low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and background signals. Herein, we summarize the distinctive advantages of 19F&#8197;NMR, along with recent progress in sample preparation and applications within the realm of in&#8208;cell NMR. Additionally, we offer insights into the future directions and prospects of this methodology based on our understanding.

         <title>Metal Organic Frameworks Synthesis: The Versatility of Triethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration of suitable synthesis strategies to meet specific needs has been a very active research topic in the field of MOFs. Triethylamine as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOF syntheses. This concept summarizes the versatility of triethylamine and provides insights into further development of MOF syntheses.







Abstract
Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with exceptionally customizable composition and properties. MOFs intrinsically possess open metal sites, tunable pore size/shape and an ultra&#8208;large specific surface area, and have obtained significant attention over the past 30&#8197;years. Furthermore, through the integration of functional moieties such as, molecules, functional groups, noble metal clusters and nanocrystals or nanoparticles into MOFs, the resulting composites have greatly enriched the physical and chemical properties of pure MOFs, enabling their application in a wider range of fields. Triethylamine (TEA) as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOFs. In this Concept, the versatility of triethylamine when involved in the synthesis of MOFs is discussed. Four sections are used to elaborate on the role of TEA including: (1) Single crystal synthesis; (2) Size and morphology control; (3) Counterion of MOFs; (4) MOFs composites synthesis. In the last part, we highlight the potential of TEA for further developments.

         <title>Selective Mono&#8208;Defluorinative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Trifluoromethyl arenes via Multiphoton Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. A series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds can be generated while the the addition of D2O leads to highly deuterated derivatives.







Abstract
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. Trifluoromethyl arenes were demonstrated to undergo selective mono&#8208;defluorinative alkylation under mild reaction conditions providing access to a series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and general functional group tolerance. In addition to the electron&#8208;deficient trifluoromethyl arenes that are easily reduced to the corresponding radical anion, more challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates were also successfully applied. Steady&#8208;State Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching studies indicated that the trifluoromethyl arenes were reduced by the multiphoton excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>Designing Powerful Biindole&#8208;Based Inherently Chiral Selectors: Enhancing Enantiodiscrimination by Core Functionalization with Additional Coordination Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a further coordination element to biindole&#8208;based inherent chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, by exploiting their peculiar advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms in the atropisomeric core, can powerfully enhance their remarkable enantiodiscrimination performances, as shown by tests with both model ferrocenyl and NSAIDs chiral probes.







Abstract
Among inherently chiral selectors of axial stereogenicity, usually resulting in very good enantiodiscrimination performances, the biindole&#8208;based family has the additional advantage of very easy functionalization of the two nitrogen atoms with a variety of substituents with desirable properties. Aiming to evaluate the possibility of exploiting such feature to enhance the enantiodiscrimination ability of the archetype structure, a series of three inherently chiral monomers were designed and synthesized, characterised by a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric core conjugated to bithiophene wings enabling fast and regular electrooligomerization, and functionalised at the nitrogen atoms with an ethyl, a methoxyethyl, or a hydroxyethyl substituent. Nitrogen alkylation was also exploited to obtain for the first time the chemical resolution of the biindole selectors without employing chiral HPLC. The enantiodiscrimination ability of the selector series was comparatively evaluated in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept chiral voltammetry experiments with a &#8220;benchmark&#8221; chiral ferrocenyl probe as well as with chiral non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs naproxen and ketoprofen. The large enantiomer potential differences for all probes increased in the ethyl &lt; methoxyethyl &#8810; hydroxyethyl sequence of selector substituents, supporting our assumption on the beneficial role of an additional coordination element. The powerful hydroxyethyl selector was also applied to ketoprofen in a commercial drug matrix.

         <title>Combined Covalent and Supramolecular Polymerization to Reinforce Perylenebisimide Photosynthetic &#8220;Quantasomes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the paired function of Photosystem II (PSII) supercomplexes, artificial quantasomes (QS) are formed by encapsulating the deca&#8208;anionic oxygen&#8208;evolving catalyst Ru4POM within a multichromophoric &#8220;corolla&#8221; of cationic perylenebisimides. Covalent fixation of the QS supramolecular network is obtained herein by photo&#8208;polymerization of styrene terminals installed on the PBI antennas (QS&#8208;PolyS), enhancing the oxygenic photocurrent and stability under high solar irradiance.







Abstract
PSII&#8208;inspired quantasomes have emerged as promising artificial photosystems evolving oxygen from water due to their integrated multi&#8208;chromophore asset, hierarchical architecture, and efficient light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. In this study, we adopt a combined covalent and supramolecular strategy by implementing a poly&#8208;styrene backbone that reinforces proximity and pairing between adjacent perylenebisimide (PBI) quantasome units. The covalent fixation of the quantasome network results in a significant enhancement of the photoelectrocatalytic performance on engineered IO&#8208;ITO photoanodes, with up to 290&#8201;% photocurrent increase (J up to 100&#8197;&#956;A cm&#8722;2, &#955; &gt;450&#8197;nm, applied bias &lt;1.23&#8197;V vs RHE, F.E.O2 &gt;80&#8201;%) compared to the non&#8208;polymerized analog. Moreover, the direct PBI&#8208;quantasome polymerization on the photoanode surface was performed by light irradiation of the radical initiator 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Azobis(2&#8208;methylpropionamidine), improving the photoelectrode robustness under high solar irradiance (&gt;8 suns) and limiting the photocurrent loss (&lt;20&#8201;%) at 1.52&#8197;V vs RHE compared to the non&#8208;polymerized system.

         <title>Development of Pyridothiophene Compounds for PET Imaging of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
47 derivatives of a potent &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregate binding pyridothiophene (asyn&#8208;44) were synthesized and screened against [3H]asyn&#8208;44 in competitive binding assays using post&#8208;mortem Parkinsons disease brain homogenates and Ki values of the most potent compounds were determined. Asyn&#8208;44 was labelled with fluorine&#8208;18 for preliminary PET imaging in rats, which showed high initial brain uptake, moderate washout, and low variability.







Abstract
Aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) protein is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers to image &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates has been a longstanding goal. This work explores the suitability of a pyridothiophene scaffold for &#945;&#8208;syn PET radiotracers, where 47 derivatives of a potent pyridothiophene (asyn&#8208;44; Kd=1.85&#8197;nM) were synthesized and screened against [3H]asyn&#8208;44 in competitive binding assays using post&#8208;mortem PD brain homogenates. Equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) values of the most potent compounds were determined, of which three had Ki&#8242;s in the lower nanomolar range (12&#8211;15&#8197;nM). An autoradiography study confirmed that [3H]asyn&#8208;44 is promising for imaging brain sections from multiple system atrophy and PD donors. Fluorine&#8208;18 labelled asyn&#8208;44 was synthesized in 6&#177;2&#8201;% radiochemical yield (decay&#8208;corrected, n=5) with a molar activity of 263&#177;121 GBq/&#956;mol. Preliminary PET imaging of [18F]asyn&#8208;44 in rats showed high initial brain uptake (&gt;1.5 standardized uptake value (SUV)), moderate washout (~0.4 SUV at 60&#8197;min), and low variability. Radiometabolite analysis showed 60&#8211;80&#8201;% parent tracer in the brain after 30 and 60&#8197;mins. While [18F]asyn&#8208;44 displayed good in&#8197;vitro properties and acceptable brain uptake, troublesome radiometabolites precluded further PET imaging studies. The synthesis and in&#8197;vitro evaluation of additional pyridothiophene derivatives are underway, with the goal of attaining improved affinity and metabolic stability.

         <title>(Diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine Oxide &#8211; A Diazoalkane Reagent for [3+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient protocol for the generation of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine &#8211; a novel diazoalkane reagent &#8211; based on the diazotization reaction under anhydrous conditions is described. The title compound can be prepared as ca. 1.5&#8197;M solution in chloroform and can be stored at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C for at least a month. The proposed reagent readily undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with various electron&#8208;poor alkynes and alkenes providing the corresponding Me2P(O)&#8208;substituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines, respectively.







Abstract
A safe and efficient method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide &#8211; a hereto unexplored diazoalkane reagent &#8211; is developed. The method is based on the diazotization of the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted amine (readily available in multigram quantities) in non&#8208;aqueous media. The protocol provides the target product as ca. 1.5&#8197;M CHCl3 solution which is stable at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C. The utility of the synthesized diazoalkane is illustrated by its [3+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;poor alkynes and alkenes providing the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines with moderate to good efficiency. In this view, the title compound represents and an important extension of medicinally relevant phosphine oxide reagents.

         <title>Evolution of a Combined UV/Vis and NMR Setup with Fixed Pathlengths for Mass&#8208;limited Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;in&#8208;one: We present a new combined UV/Vis and NMR setup, which allows for the simultaneous measurement of both spectra on mass&#8208;limited samples. A thorough comparison with existing and separate setups is performed.







Abstract
The investigation of reaction mechanisms is a complex task that usually requires the use of several techniques. To obtain as much information as possible on the reaction and any intermediates &#8211; possibly invisible to one technique &#8211; the combination of techniques is a solution. In this work we present a new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy and compare it to an established alternative. The presented approach allows a versatile usage of different commercially&#8208;available components like mirrors and fiber bundles as well as different fixed pathlengths according to double transmission or single transmission measurements. While a previous approach is based on a dip&#8208;probe setup for conventional NMR probes, the new one is based on a micro&#8208;Helmholtz coil array (LiquidVoxel&#8482;). This makes the use of rectangular cuvettes possible, which ensure well&#8208;defined pathlengths allowing for quantification of species. Additionally, very low quantities of compound can be analyzed due to the microfabrication and small cuvette size used. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle this new setup for combined UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy is used to examine a well&#8208;studied photochromic system of the dithienylethene compound class. A thorough comparison of the pros and cons of the two setups for combined UV/Vis and NMR measurements is performed.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Neptunium Oxidation to the Heptavalent State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomistic insights in the ozonolysis of Np(V) to form Np(VII) under alkaline conditions and role of co&#8208;solutes in the rate of the oxidation are explored through UV/Vis and vibrational spectroscopic analysis. Additional Density Functional Theory calculations are utilized to understand the mechanism of the oxidation reaction and possible intermediate species.







Abstract
Neptunium can exist in multiple oxidation states, including the rare and poorly understood heptavalent form. In this work, we monitored the formation of heptavalent neptunium [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8722; during ozonolysis of aqueous MOH (M=Li, Na, K) solutions using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. All experimental reactions were closely monitored via absorption and vibrational spectroscopy to follow both the oxidation state and the speciation of neptunium guided by the calculated vibrational frequencies for various neptunium species. The mechanism of the reaction partly involves oxidative dissolution of transient Np(VI) oxide/hydroxide solid phases, the identity of which are dependent on the co&#8208;precipitating counter&#8208;cation Li+/Na+/K+. Additional calculations suggest that the most favorable energetic pathway occurs through the reaction of a [Np(V)O2(OH)4]3&#8722; with the hydroxide radical to form [Np(VI)O2(OH)4]2&#8722;, followed by an additional oxidation with HO&#8901; to create [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8722;.

         <title>Different Reaction Modes Operating in ansa&#8208;Half&#8208;Sandwich Magnesium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>

Show me how many ligands you accept, and I will tell you how you react: depending on the number of ligands that the ansa&#8208;half&#8208;sandwich magnesium catalyst can bind, our DFT calculations show that the mechanism proceeds differently with competitive reaction channels.







Abstract
Magnesium&#8208;based catalysts are becoming popular for hydroelementation reactions specially using p&#8208;block reagents. Based on the seminal report from Sch&#228;fer's group (ChemCatChem 2022, 14, e202201007), our study demonstrates that the reaction mechanisms exhibit a far greater degree of complexity than originally presumed. Magnesium has a variety of coordination modes (and access to different hybridizations) which allows this electron&#8208;deficient centre to modulate its catalytic power depending on the &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the reagent. DFT calculations demonstrate several reaction channels closely operating in these versatile catalysts. In addition, variations in limiting energy barriers resulting from catalyst modifications were examined as a function of the Hammett constant, thereby predicting enhanced efficiency in reaction conversions.

         <title>Tryptophan&#8208;Doped Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films with Ultralong&#8208;Lifetime Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Color&#8208;Tunable Afterglow Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(vinyl alcohol) films doped with eight different tryptophan derivatives have been shown to exhibit ultralong phosphorescence emission under ambient conditions. The afterglow color of the films can be adjusted through a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process.







Abstract
The development of a persistent luminescence system with long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable afterglow at room temperature represents a challenge, largely due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathway. In this study, an ultralong&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system has been achieved using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding strategy where poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices were doped with tryptophan (Trp) derivatives. The PVA film doped with N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(9&#8208;Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan (Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) exhibited a long&#8208;lived phosphorescence emission of up to 3859.70&#8197;ms, and a blue afterglow for a duration greater than 34&#8197;s, under ambient conditions. The introduction of two other fluorescent dyes (i.&#8201;e., Rhodamine B and Basicred14) to the PVA film facilitates adjustment to the color of the afterglow from blue to orange, and pink, by a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process. These films have been successfully applied in silk&#8208;screen printing and in multicolor afterglow light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) arrays.

         <title>Bacteria at Work &#8211; Experimental and Theoretical Studies Reveal the Catalytic Mechanism of Ectoine Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ectoine is a compound gaining popularity in recent years, having unique moisturizing and cell&#8208;protective properties. This osmolyte is produced by many bacteria species via the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, the final stage of which is&#160;catalyzed by Ectoine Synthase (EctC). Here, the catalytic mechanism of EctC is proposed, supported by theoretical (QM/MM) and experimental studies (Mossbauer spectroscopy).







Abstract
Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe2+&#8208;dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe2+ ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC&#8208;catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu57, Tyr84 and His92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur.

     alt="Bacteria at Work &#8211; Experimental and Theoretical Studies Reveal the Catalytic Mechanism of Ectoine Synthase"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ectoine is a compound gaining popularity in recent years, having unique moisturizing and cell-protective properties. This osmolyte is produced by many bacteria species via the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, the final stage of which is&#160;catalyzed by Ectoine Synthase (EctC). Here, the catalytic mechanism of EctC is proposed, supported by theoretical (QM/MM) and experimental studies (Mossbauer spectroscopy).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC-catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu57, Tyr84 and His92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur. They fill the first coordination sphere of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-cofactor and act as critical proton donors and acceptors during the cyclization reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Action Plots Reveal Red&#8208;shifted Wavelength&#8208;dependent Photoproduct Distributions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical action plots are used to deconvolute the wavelength&#8208;selective photoreactivity of a single chromophore. Remarkably, by irradiating with different monochromatic wavelengths of light, either the trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;isomerization or the [2+2]&#8208;photocyclisation can be selectively triggered.







Abstract
Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for mapping photochemical reaction outcomes wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength. Typically, they map either the depletion of a reactant or the formation of a specific product as a function of wavelength. Herein, we exploit action plots to simultaneously map the formation of several photochemical products from a single chromophore. We demonstrate that the wavelength&#8208;resolved mapping of two reaction products formed during the irradiation of a chalcone species not only shows wavelength dependence &#8211; exhibiting the typical strong red&#8208;shift of the photochemical reactivity compared to the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore &#8211; but also a strong wavelength selectivity with remarkably different product distributions resulting from different irradiation wavelengths.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction by Urea Hangman Mn Terpyridine species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of urea groups functioning as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding hangman significantly increases the turnover frequency (TOF) for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO to ca. 1008&#8197;s&#8722;1 with this family of molecular catalysts. The results clearly demonstrate a remarkable increase in icat/ip in comparison to the single&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding derivates.







Abstract
Based on our previous study in chemical subtleties of the proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) to regulate the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), we have developed a family of Mn terpyridine derivatives, in which urea groups functions as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding hangman to accelerate the reaction rate. We found that such changes to the second coordination sphere significantly increased the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 reduction to ca. 360 
 with this family of molecular catalysts while maintaining high selectivity (ca. 100&#8201;%&#177;3) for CO even in the presence of a large amount of phenol as proton source. Notably, the compounds studied in this manuscript all exhibit large value for 
 as that achieved by Fe porphyrins derivates, while saving up to 0.55&#8197;V in overpotential with respect to the latter.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a] pyridine Carboxamide in Aqueous Ethanol under Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H olefinations of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides were accomplished with greener oxygen in H2O/EtOH robust fashion. Control experimental mechanistic studies supported the formation of organometallic Pd&#8208;intermediates, which are the key elements for the success of the sustainable protocol.







Abstract
The advancement of sustainable chemistry and changes in the economy are strongly intertwined. Reaction time, cost savings, moderate temperatures, and generation of the fewest byproducts are frequently achieved by using catalytic processes. Herein, we report the C&#8722;H olefination of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamides with various acrylates in the presence of Pd (OAc)2 with O2 as the oxidant in aqueous ethanol rather than using non&#8208;ecofriendly solvents. The C&#8722;H activation features most user&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, excellent yield as well as plenty substrate scope and applicable for C&#8722;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O. Experimental mechanistic studies indicate that C&#8722;H activation step succeeded after formation of tetra coordinated square planer Pd&#8208;substrate adduct.

         <title>Regulation of Electronic Structures of the Urchin&#8208;Like NiCoP/CoP Nanocatalysts for Fast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures have been developed through a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis process. The nano&#8208;architecture and electronic configuration can be regulated by adjusting the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus. Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P shows excellent performance in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane. Furthermore, by combining infrared spectroscopy and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible reaction mechanism has been proposed.







Abstract
The exploration of stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts toward ammonia borane hydrolysis is of vital significance for the practical implementation of this hydrogen production technology. Integrating interface engineering and nano&#8208;architecture engineering is a favorable strategy to elevate catalytic performance, as it can modify the electronic structure and provide sufficient active sites simultaneously. In this work, urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures are prepared via a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis route. It is demonstrated that the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus are crucial for adjusting the morphology, enhancing the exposed surface area, facilitating charge transfer, and modulating the adsorption and activation of H2O molecules. Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P heterostructure displays remarkable catalytic properties in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 30.3&#8197;molH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1, a low apparent activation energy of 25.89&#8197;kJ&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and good stability.

The study presents BTA&#8208;D3, a novel C3&#8208;symmetric &#946;&#8208;diketone compound, and its monomeric counterpart, D, focusing on synthesis, photophysical properties, theoretical calculation, and aggregation properties. BTA&#8208;D3 exhibits Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) with solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence. The anisotropy fluorescence suggested the presence of energy migration in BTA&#8208;D3. Unique polymorphism and growth of self&#8208;organized aggregates offer insights into molecular alignment for diverse fluorescence in materials.







Abstract
The study introduces a novel C3&#8208;symmetric &#946;&#8208;diketone compound, BTA&#8208;D3, and its monomeric counterpart, D, with a focus on their synthetic procedure, photophysical properties and aggregation behavior. Both compounds exhibit characteristic absorption and weak fluorescence in solution, with BTA&#8208;D3 displaying higher absorption coefficients due to its larger number of diketone units. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest increased co&#8208;planarity of diketone groups in BTA&#8208;D3. A significant finding is the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) property of BTA&#8208;D3, as its fluorescence intensity increases dramatically when exposed to specific solvent ratios. The AIE behavior is attributed to intermolecular excitonic interaction between BTA&#8208;D3 molecules in self&#8208;organized aggregates. We also studied fluorescence anisotropy of BTA&#8208;D3 and D. Despite its larger size, BTA&#8208;D3 showed reduced anisotropy values because of efficient intramolecular energy migration among three diketone units. Furthermore, BTA&#8208;D3 demonstrates unique polymorphism, yielding different emission colors and structures depending on the solvent used. A unique approach is presented for promoting the growth of self&#8208;organized aggregate structures via solvent evaporation, leading to distinct fluorescence properties. This research contributes to the understanding of C3&#8208;symmetric structural molecules and provides insights into strategies for controlling molecular alignment to achieve diverse fluorescence coloration in molecular materials.

         <title>Tuning the Liquid Crystallinity and Electroluminescence via Sulfonation of S&#8208;Annulated Perylene Tetraester</title>

Tuning of liquid crystallinity, fluorescence and electroluminescence by molecular design.







Abstract
This study presents a comparative analysis of S&#8208;annulated perylene tetraester (PTE&#8208;S) and its sulfone (PTE&#8208;SO2) analogue. This sulfone modification reduced melting point and stabilized a room temperature columnar rectangular (Colr) phase in contrast to its parent PTE&#8208;S which showed a crystalline behaviour at room temperature. This molecular design also leads to red&#8208;shifted absorbance and emission in comparison to PTE&#8208;S, along with a tuning of photoluminescence from sky blue to green, achieving an impressive quantum yield of 85&#8201;%. OLED devices fabricated using PTE&#8208;SO2 as emitter material at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1&#8197;wt.% in CBP as host material. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.9&#8201;% was observed with the 0.5&#8197;wt.% PTE&#8208;SO2 in CBP with CIE coordinates of (0.45, 0.35), accompanied by an orange luminance of 848 cd/m2. Notably, a device with a 0.5&#8197;wt% doping concentration of PTE&#8208;S demonstrates an EQE of 3.5&#8201;%, and cyan luminance of 2,598 cd/m2.

         <title>Tuning the Inorganic Core of a reduced Ni2Ge2 Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose convenient synthetic strategies to access highly reduced Ni2Ge2 inorganic square&#8208;type cores, identified as key motifs in catalysis. We demonstrate that the structure and bonding within the metallic core can be transformed by the addition of common Lewis bases, providing as well computational insights that will aid in the rationale preparation of these unusual clusters.







Abstract
Tetranuclear cores (M&#8722;E)2 of transition metals (M) and tetrylenes (EII=Si, Ge, Sn) are key motifs in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They exhibit a continuum of M&#8722;M and E&#8722;E bonding within the inorganic core that leads to a variety of structures for which there are no specific synthetic methods. Herein, we report a series of highly reduced [Ni0GeII]2 squares solely stabilized by bulky terphenyl (C6H3&#8722;2,6&#8208;Ar2) ligands, for which we provide complementary and high&#8208;yielding syntheses. Reactivity studies with common Lewis bases (carbene and CO) evince that the structure of the (M&#8722;E)2 core can be transformed. We have investigated this core modification by computational means, offering a rationale to better understand the continuum of bonding across these clusters.

         <title>Ultrafast Halogen Dance Reactions of Bromoarenes Enabled by Catalytic Potassium Hexamethyldisilazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen&#8208;dance&#8208;type reactions to provide bromoarenes without aryne formation. KHMDS exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu, which is used stoichiometrically in the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed, demonstrating the potential of new catalytic reactions based on highly reactive mixed organometallic species.







Abstract
Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base, a stoichiometric combination of nBuLi and KOtBu, is commonly used as a superbase for deprotonating a wide range of organic compounds. In the present study, we report that catalytic potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu for successive bromine&#8211;metal exchanges. Accordingly, 1&#8211;10&#8197;mol% of KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen dance reactions to introduce various electrophiles to bromopyridine, bromoimidazole, bromothiophene, bromofuran, and bromobenzene derivatives with the bromo group translocated from the original position. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed to explain the ultrafast bromine transfer.

The integration of multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in&#8197;situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting characteristics can alleviate deep tumor tissue hypoxia for improving tumor&#8208;specific phototherapy.







Abstract
Hypoxia is a critical factor for restricting photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumor, and it becomes increasingly severe with increasing tissue depth. Thus, the relief of deep tumor hypoxia is extremely important to improve the PDT efficacy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive size&#8208;switchable hyaluronic acid&#8208;hybridized Ru nanoaggregates (HA@Ru NAs) were developed via screening reaction temperature to alleviate deep tumor hypoxia for improving the tumor&#8208;specific PDT by the artful integration multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in&#8197;situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting (RMT). In this nanosystem, Ru NPs not only enabled HA@Ru NAs to have near infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic functions, but also could catalyze endogenous H2O2 to produce O2 in&#8197;situ. More importantly, hyaluronidase (HAase) overexpressed in the TME could trigger disassembly of HA@Ru NAs via the hydrolysis of HA, offering the smart size switch capability from 60 to 15&#8197;nm for enhancing tumor penetration. Moreover, the RMT characteristics of HA ensured that HA@Ru NAs could specially enter CD44&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, enhancing tumor&#8208;specific precision of phototherapy. Taken together these distinguishing characteristics, smart HA@Ru NAs successfully realized the relief of deep tumor hypoxia to improve the tumor&#8208;specific PDT.

Sn2(TIPS)4 is the second distannene with a planar, alkene&#8208;like arrangement of substituents. In the solid state it shows exciting behaviour in M&#246;ssbauer studies and interesting cycloaddition reactions in solution.







Abstract
By treating KSiiPr3 with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 the distannene Sn2(TIPS)4 (TIPS=SiiPr3) is formed in a metathesis reaction. The crystal structure analysis of Sn2(TIPS)4 reveals a planar arrangement of the substituents in the solid&#8208;state and hence the second planar alkene like distannene of its kind. Due to the TIPS substituents, Sn2(TIPS)4 is well soluble in all commonly used organic solvents, opening the door for various analytics and reactivity studies. Due to its stability in solution, various reactions can be performed such as cycloaddition reactions with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (DMBD) and TMS&#8208;azide.

         <title>Substitution Lability of the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] Towards Triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper we present the structural diversity of products formed upon substitution of the labile perfluorinated Cp* ligand [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) by triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi).







Abstract
Triphenylpnictogens EPh3 (E=N, P, As, Sb, Bi) are able to displace the perfluorinated Cp* ligand in [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in up to quantitative yield. The resulting ionic products contain [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; as uncoordinated counter anion. The cations feature [Rh(COD)]+ fragments, coordinated by one (N, Bi), two (P, As) or three (Sb) triphenylpnictogen moieties. Whereas coordination via the pnictogen is observed for P, As and Sb, &#960;&#8208;coordination of the aryl rings is observed for N and Bi.

         <title>Gas Evolution as a Tool to Study Reaction Kinetics Under Biomimetic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress of transition metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal chemical reactions can be accurately monitored by measuring the gas evolution in time using a bubble counter. This protocol provides insight into the performance of a catalytic system under biomimetic conditions, supporting iterative catalyst development for in&#8197;vivo applications.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry is rapidly growing, presenting successful applications of organic and transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions in cells and living systems (in vivo). The development of such reactions typically proceeds through many iterative steps focused on biocompatibility and fast reaction kinetics to ensure product formation. However, obtaining kinetic data, even under simulated biological (biomimetic) conditions, remains a challenge due to substantial concentrations of salts and biomolecules hampering the use of typically employed solution&#8208;phase analytical techniques. In this study, we explored the suitability of gas evolution as a probe to study kinetics under biomimetic conditions. As proof of concept, we show that the progress of two transition metal&#8208;catalysed bioorthogonal chemical reactions can be accurately monitored, regardless of the complexity of the medium. As such, we introduce a protocol to gain more insight into the performance of a catalytic system under biomimetic conditions to further progress iterative catalyst development for in vivo applications.

         <title>Caged Dexamethasone to Photo&#8208;control the Development of Embryos through Activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily synthesized caged inducer for the glucocorticoid receptor is demonstrated to spatially and temporally control gene&#8208;expression and development in two well&#8208;known vertebrate models: Zebrafish and Xenopus. Biologically orthogonal to the ones for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, it brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.







Abstract
Efficient tools for controlling molecular functions with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution are much in demand to investigate biological processes in living systems. Here we report an easily synthesized caged dexamethasone for photo&#8208;activating cytoplasmic proteins fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the dark, it is stable in&#8197;vitro as well as in&#8197;vivo in both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus sp, two significant models of vertebrates. In contrast, it liberates dexamethasone upon UV illumination, which has been harnessed to interfere with developmental steps in embryos of these animals. Interestingly, this new system is biologically orthogonal to the one for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, which brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.

Inspired by Photosystem II organization in chloroplast membranes, perylenebisimide quantasomes are depicted as green&#8208;to&#8208;reddish cylindrical units self&#8208;assembling into a multi&#8208;stacked nano&#8208;lamellar architecture on the surface of IO&#8208;ITO photoanodes. Photo&#8208;polymerization of the perylene precursors is instrumental to fixing this multichromophoric system that mimics the oxygen evolution activity of the natural enzyme.

         <title>Application of quasi solid electrolytes in organic based electrochromic devices: A mini review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of electrochromic devices (ECDs) is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, It is important to understand the current state of developing quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes and ways of improving their efficiencies.







Abstract
The interest in all solid organic based electrochromic devices (ECDs) is on the increase. This is because these devices offer the applicability of electrochromic materials in products such as smart sensors, smart windows, flexible wearables and energy storage devices. The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of these ECDs is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, in this review, a detailed discussion is presented on the progress in the development of semi&#8208;solid electrolytes for ECDs fabrication. The preparation of the most common electrolytes that have been applied for organic based ECDs are summarized. Particular attention is given to efforts and strategies that have been adopted to improve the efficiency of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes. Importantly, knowledge gaps that warrant further research are clearly identified and recommendations for future works are suggested. This review will be very beneficial for both established and new researchers in the field of electrochromic devices and material science.

         <title>2D Monolayer Catalysts: Towards Efficient Water Splitting and Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
A viable alternative to non&#8208;renewable hydrocarbon fuels is hydrogen gas, created using a safe, environmentally friendly process like water splitting. An important role in water&#8208;splitting applications is played by the development of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), transition metal carbides (MXenes), graphene&#8208;derived 2D layered nanomaterials, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. Advanced synthesis methods and characterization instruments enabled an effective application for improved electrocatalytic water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production. Enhancing active sites, modifying the phase and electronic structure, adding conductive elements like transition metals, forming heterostructures, altering the defect state, etc., can improve the catalytic activity of 2D stacked hybrid monolayer nanomaterials. The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.

         <title>Organic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes As Potential Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the synthesis, characterization, and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, often referred to as charge transfer complexes. Donors, categorized as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles, and sulphur&#8208;containing aromatic compounds, are examined in their reactions with various acceptors like TCNQ, TCNE, fullerenes, and others. The article delves into applications of resulting complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes and includes theoretical investigations to rationalize the observed properties.







Abstract
In this review article, the synthesis, characterization and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes are highlighted and a special emphasis has been placed on developing them as semiconducting materials. The electron&#8208;rich molecules, i.&#8201;e., donors have been broadly grouped in three categories, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles and sulphur containing aromatic donors. The reactions of these classes of the donors with the acceptors, namely tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), benzoquinone, pyromellitic dianhydride and pyromellitic diimides, fullerenes, phenazine, benzothiadiazole, naphthalimide, DMAD, maleic anhydride, viologens and naphthalene diimide are described. The potential applications of the resulting DA complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes are also included. The theoretical investigation of many of these products with a view to rationalise their observed physico&#8208;chemical properties is also discussed.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon Materials for Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and preparation of biomass&#8208;derived porous carbon materials in recent five years was summarized. These carbon materials were briefly catalogized into two types, plant&#8208;derived and animal&#8208;derived carbon materials. Heteroatoms doping was illustrated with an emphasis on single&#8208;element doping and multi&#8208;element doping, respectively. The advantages of these porous carbon materials applicated in electrochemical energy storage devices, such as LIBs, SIBs, PIBs, and SCs were reviewed. The remaining challenges and prospects in the field were outlined.







Abstract
The environmental impact from the waste disposal has been widely concerned around the world. The conversion of wastes to useful resources is important for the sustainable society. As a typical family of wastes, biomass materials basically composed of collagen, protein and lignin are considered as useful resources for recycle and reuse. In recent years, the development of carbon material derived from biomasses, such as plants, crops, animals and their application in electrochemical energy storage have attracted extensive attention. Through the selection of the appropriate biomass, the optimization of the activation method and the control of the pyrolysis temperatures, carbon materials with desired features, such as high&#8208;specific surface area, variable porous framework, and controllable heteroatom&#8208;doping have been fabricated. Herein, this review summarized the preparation methods, morphologies, heteroatoms doping in the plant/animal&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials, and their application as electrode materials for secondary batteries and supercapacitors, and as electrode support for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The challenges and prospects for the controllable synthesis and large&#8208;scale application of biomass&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials have also been outlooked.

         <title>A Chiral [2+3] Covalent Organic Cage Based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 23, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cage formed with three 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL units was prepared through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach. This architecture contains six OH functions pointing inside the cavity. Host&#8208;guest studies demonstrated enantiopreference of the cage for a chiral ammonium cation.







Abstract
A [2+3] chiral covalent organic cage is produced through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach by mixing two readily available building units, viz. an enantiopure 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diformyl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL compound (A) with a triamino spacer (B). The two enantiomeric (R,R,R) and (S,S,S) forms of the cage C are formed nearly quantitatively thanks to the reversibility of the imine linkage. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of cage (S,S,S)&#8208;C highlights that the six OH functions of the BINOL fragments are positioned inside the cage cavity. Upon reduction of the imine bonds of cage C, the amine cage D is obtained. The ability of the cage D to host the 1&#8208;phenylethylammonium cation (EH+) as a guest is evaluated through UV, CD and DOSY NMR studies. A higher binding constant for (R)&#8208;EH+ cation (Ka=1.7 106&#177;10&#8201;%&#8197;M&#8722;1) related to (S)&#8208;EH+ (Ka=0.9 106&#177;10&#8201;%&#8197;M&#8722;1) is determined in the presence of the (R,R,R)&#8208;D cage. This enantiopreference is in close agreement with molecular dynamics simulation.

&#8220;Could we extend the life time of the photocatalytic systems by designing an ad&#8208;hoc porous polymer that allowed a supramolecular architecture while slowing down the disassembly of the quantasome?&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202303784).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Marcella Bonchio at the University of Padova and J&#233;r&#244;me Canivet at the CNRS&#8211;University of Lyon. The image depicts the hierarchical self&#8208;organization of bio&#8208;inspired quantasomes, crosslinked within a polystyrene network to enchain their lateral and orthogonal proximity for long&#8208;lasting oxygen evolution using green photons.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer (CT) crystals exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties with interesting applications. We present a rational and easy guide which allows to foresee the effective charge transfer co&#8208;crystal production and that is based on the comparison of the frontier molecular orbital (MO) energies of a donor and acceptor couple. For the sake of comparison, theoretical calculations have been carried out by using the cheap and fast PM6 semiempirical Hamiltonian and pure HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ level of the theory. The results are then compared with experimental results obtained both by chemical (bromine and iodine were used as the acceptor) and electrochemical doping (exploiting an original experimental set&#8208;up by this laboratory: the electrochemical transistor). Infra&#8208;red vibrational experimental results and theoretically calculated spectra are compared to assess both the effective donor&#8208;acceptor (D/A) charge&#8208;transfer and transport mechanism (giant IRAV polaron signature). XPS spectra have been collected (carbon (1s) and iodine (3d5/2)) signals, yielding further evidence of the effective formation of the CT anthracene:iodine complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites for Glioma Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanocomposites, camouflaged by cell membranes, exosomes or other bio&#8208;membranes, exhibit exceptional characteristics that facilitate efficient and precise delivery of contrast agents or drugs to glioma sites. These biomimetic nanocomposites are promising in glioma imaging and therapy, including fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multimodal imaging, as well as chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy.







Abstract
Glioma, the most common primary brain tumor, is highly invasive and grows rapidly. As such, the survival of glioma patients is relatively short, highlighting the vital importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of glioma. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the non&#8208;targeting delivery systems of contrast agents and drugs greatly hinder the effective glioma imaging and therapy. Fortunately, in recent years, investigators have constructed various biomimetic delivery platforms utilizing the exceptional advantages of biomimetic nanocomposites, such as immune evasion, homologous targeting ability, and BBB penetrating ability, to achieve efficient and precise delivery of substances to glioma sites for improved diagnosis and treatment. In this concept, we present the application of these biomimetic nanocomposites in fluorescence imaging (FI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and multi&#8208;modal imaging, as well as in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and combined therapy for glioma. Lastly, we provide our perspective on this research field.

         <title>Detection and Characterization of Hydride Ligands in Copper Complexes by Hard X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal complexes, particularly copper hydrides, play an important role in various catalytic processes and molecular inorganic chemistry. This study employs synchrotron hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to gain insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydrides as potential catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The potential of high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (HERFD&#8208;XANES) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission (VtC&#8208;XES) is demonstrated with measurement on Stryker's reagent (Cu6H6) and [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;H)(dpmppe)2](PF6)2 (Cu3H), alongside a non&#8208;hydride copper compound (Cu&#8208;I). The XANES analysis reveals that coordination geometries strongly influence the spectra, providing only indirect details about hydride coordination. The VtC&#8208;XES analysis exhibits a distinct signal around 8975 eV, offering a diagnostic tool to identify hydride ligands. Theoretical calculations support and extend these findings by comparing hydride&#8208;containing complexes with their hydride&#8208;free counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthetic Access to Stable Isotope Labelled Pseudouridine Phosphoramidites for RNA NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the efficient synthetic access to 13C/15N&#8208;labelled pseudouridine phosphoramidites, which were incorporated into a binary H/ACA box guide RNA/product complex comprising 77 nucleotides (nts) in total and into a 75 nt E. coli tRNAGly. The stable isotope (SI) labelled pseudouridines were produced via a highly efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis. 13C/15N labelled uracils were produced via chemical synthesis and enzymatically converted to 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate pseudouridine (&#936;MP) by using YeiN, a &#936;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate C&#8208;glycosidase. Removal of the 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate group yielded the desired pseudouridine nucleoside (&#936;), which was transformed into a phosphoramidite building suitable for RNA solid phase synthesis. A &#936; &#8208;building block carrying both a 13C and a 15N label was incorporated into a product RNA and the complex formation with a 63 nt H/ACA box RNA could be observed via NMR. Furthermore, the SI labelled pseudouridine building block was used to determine imino proton bulk water exchange rates of a 75 nt E. coli tRNAGly CCmnm5U, identifying the T&#936;C&#8208;loop 5&#8208;methyluridine as a modifier of the exchange rates. The efficient synthetic access to SI labelled &#936; building blocks will allow the solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic studies of &#936; containing RNAs and will facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis of &#936;&#8208;modified nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkably High Separation of Neodymium from Praseodymium by Selective Dissolution from their Oxide Mixture using an Ionic Liquid Containing a&#946;&#8208;Diketone</title>

A simple, effective, direct, and environmentally benign but unprecedented high mutual separation efficiency for Nd and Pr from their oxide mixture with &#946;Nd/Pr&gt;500 by selective dissolution in water equilibrated C4mim.NTf2 ionic liquid containing TTA.







Abstract
A simple, efficient, direct and economical method for the mutual separation of Nd and Pr was developed by the selective dissolution of Nd2O3 from their oxide mixtures in an ionic liquid containing 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) resulting in an unprecedented separation factor (&#946;Nd/Pr)&gt;500, which is 277&#8197;times more than the thus far reported &#946;Nd/Pr values. The proposed mechanism was supported by DFT computations.

         <title>Pathway Selection in Temporal Evolution of Supramolecular Polymers of Ionic &#960;&#8208;systems: Amphiphilic Organic Solvent Dictates the Fate of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding solvent&#8208;solute interactions is essential to designing and synthesising soft materials with tailor&#8208;made functions. Although the interaction of the solute with the solvent mixture is more complex than the single solvent medium, solvent mixtures are exciting to unfold several unforeseen phenomena in supramolecular chemistry. Here we report two unforeseen pathways observed during the hierarchical assembly of cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in a water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixtures. When the aqueous supramolecular polymers (SPs) of cPDIs are injected into AOS, initially kinetically trapped short SPs are formed, which gradually transform into thermodynamically stable high aspect ratio SP networks. Using various experimental and theoretical investigations, we found that this temporal evolution follows two distinct pathways depending on the nature of the water&#8208;AOS interactions. If the AOS is isopropanol (IPA), water is released from cPDIs into bulk IPA due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which further decreases the monomer concentration of cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;1). In the case of dioxane AOS, cPDIs monomer concentration further increases as water is retained among cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;2) due to relatively weak interactions between dioxane and water. Interestingly, these two pathways are accelerated by external stimuli such as heat and mechanical agitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Cycles: Saponification&#8208;Enhanced NMR Fingerprint Matching for the Identification and Stereochemical Evaluation of Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides from Natural Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We previously described NMR based fingerprint matching with peptide backbone resonances as a fast and reliable structural dereplication approach for Pseudomonas cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs). In combination with total synthesis of a small library of configurational CLiP congeners this also allows unambiguous determination of stereochemistry, facilitating structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and enabling three&#8208;dimensional structure determination. However, the on&#8208;resin macrocycle formation in the synthetic workflow brings considerable burden and limits universal applicability. This drawback is here removed altogether by also transforming the native CLiP into a linearized analogue by controlled saponification of the ester bond. This eliminates the need for macrocycle formation, limiting the synthesis effort to linear peptide analogues. NMR fingerprints of such linear peptide analogues display a sufficiently distinctive chemical shift fingerprint to act as effective discriminators. The approach is developed using viscosin group CLiPs and subsequently demonstrated on putisolvin, leading to a structural revision, and tanniamide from Pseudomonas ekonensis COR58, a newly isolated lipododecapeptide that defines a new group characterized by a ten&#8208;residue large macrocycle, the largest to date in the Pseudomonas CLiP portfolio. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the saponification&#8208; enhanced approach that broadens applicability of NMR fingerprint matching for the determination of the stereochemistry of CLiPs.</dc:description>

         <title>High pressure promotes binding of the allosteric inhibitor Zn2+&#8208;cyclen in crystals of activated H&#8208;Ras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we experimentally investigate the potency of high pressure to drive a protein toward an excited state where an inhibitor targeted for this state can bind. Ras proteins are small GTPases cycling between active GTP&#8208;bound and inactive GDP&#8208;bound states. Various states of GTP&#8208;bound Ras in active conformation coexist in solution, amongst them, state 2 which binds to effectors, and state 1, weakly populated at ambient conditions, which has a low affinity for effectors. Zn2+&#8208;cyclen is an allosteric inhibitor of Ras protein, designed to bind specifically to the state 1. In H&#8208;Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp crystals soaked with Zn2+&#8208;cyclen, no binding could be observed, as expected in the state 2 conformation which is the dominant state at ambient pressure. Interestingly, Zn2+&#8208;cyclen binding is observed at 500 MPa pressure, close to the nucleotide, in Ras protein that is driven by pressure to a state 1 conformer. The unknown binding mode of Zn2+&#8208;cyclen to H&#8208;Ras can thus be fully characterized in atomic details. As a more general conjunction from our study, high pressure x&#8208;ray crystallography turns out to be a powerful method to induce transitions allowing drug binding in proteins that are in low&#8208;populated conformations at ambient conditions, enabling the design of specific inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Case&#8208;Study on the Photophysics of Chalcogen&#8208;Substituted Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully systematic analysis of the effect of chalcogen atoms on the photophysical properties (absorption and fluorescence spectra, excited state lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration) of 30 custom&#8208;made chalcogen&#8208;bearing tetrasubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described. Intersystem crossing rate constants were estimated by several independent methods and showed a dependency scaling as Z0.4 and &#950;0.2.







Abstract
Singlet dioxygen has been widely applied in different disciplines such as medicine (photodynamic therapy or blood sterilization), remediation (wastewater treatment) or industrial processes (fine chemicals synthesis). Particularly, it can be conveniently generated by energy transfer between a photosensitizer's triplet state and triplet dioxygen upon irradiation with visible light. Among the best photosensitizers, substituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines are prominent due to their excellent photophysical properties, which can be tuned by structural modifications, such as halogen&#8208; and chalcogen&#8208;atom substitution. These patterns allow for the enhancement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, commonly attributed to the heavy atom effect, which correlates with the atomic number (
) and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (
) of the introduced heteroatom. Herein, a fully systematic analysis of the effect exerted by chalcogen atoms on the photophysical characteristics (absorption and fluorescence properties, lifetimes and singlet dioxygen photogeneration), involving 30 custom&#8208;made &#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted chalcogen&#8208;bearing zinc(II) phthalocyanines is described and evaluated regarding the heavy atom effect. Besides, the intersystem crossing rate constants are estimated by several independent methods and a quantitative profile of the heavy atom is provided by using linear correlations between relative intersystem crossing rates and relative atomic numbers. Good linear trends for both intersystem crossing rates (S1&#8208;T1 and T1&#8208;S0) were obtained, with a dependency on the atomic number and the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant scaling as 
 and 
, respectively The trend shows to be independent of the solvent and temperature.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships for Potential Inversion From Electron Acceptors Based on Thiophene&#8208;Fused Triptycene Quinones, 1,4&#8208;Diketones and Their Malononitrile Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The products of two isomeric thiophene/triptycene para&#8208;quinones with malononitrile provide insights into modulating potential inversion in 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane type electron&#8208;acceptors. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding influences both the product distribution of the reaction to make the quinones, and the NMR chemical shift of the bridgehead hydrogens involved.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of a series of 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane (TCAQ) inspired electron acceptors based on thiophene&#8208;fused quinone and triptycene motifs is presented. This has yielded insights into structure&#8208;property relationships for establishing and modulating simultaneous two&#8208;electron reduction processes in TCAQ analogues. These new compounds were synthesised using a Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation between triptycene and thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarbonyl chloride. Isomeric para&#8208;quinones featuring a [c]&#8208;fused thiophene on one side and a &#946;,&#946;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;fused triptycene on the other were isolated alongside a thiophene&#8208;3,4&#8208;diketone which bears two triptycene fragments. Knoevenagel condensation of these products with malononitrile produced a quinoidal bis(dicyanomethylene), an oxo&#8208;dicyanomethylene and an acyclic bis(dicyanomethylene). This series of new electron accepting molecules has been studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography and the implications of their 3D structures on NMR and UV/vis absorbance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results have been ascertained with conclusions underpinned by computational methods.

         <title>Phosphoramide&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Effective Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphoramide&#8208;based tri&#8208; and hexacarboxylic acids L1 and L2 have been used as ligands for metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Whereas Zn&#8722;L1 and Cu&#8722;L1, with pseudo&#8208;3D network structures with strong hydrogen bonds between 2D layers, show high thermal stability and porosity, Zn&#8722;L2, with a typical 3D network structure, exhibits high stability and excellent gas&#8208;adsorption properties for H2, CO2, and CH4 without open metal sites.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective and facile synthetic routes to organic ligands, along with porous materials that exhibit exceptional gas&#8208;storage properties, promise significant industrial applications. Here, a two&#8208;step synthesis of novel organophosphorus ligands without metal catalysts is reported. These ligands serve as versatile linkers for the construction of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating various metal ions, including zinc and copper. One of the zinc&#8208;based MOFs demonstrates remarkable gas&#8208;storage properties, with a hydrogen (H2) capacity exceeding 2.5&#8197;wt% at 77&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa as well as a carbon dioxide (CO2) capacity exceeding 20&#8197;wt% at 298&#8197;K and 100&#8197;kPa. Furthermore, this zinc&#8208;based MOF can be synthesized through a solvothermal process on the gram scale that yields high&#8208;quality single crystals.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering Using 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy and 2D materials: a perfect combination. Since graphene's SERS effect observation, 2D layered materials have been developed as active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). This perspective highlights the key concepts behind SERS spectroscopy and provides new insights into a new research field that combines the design of SERS 2D substrates using Raman spectroscopy and imaging.







Abstract
The use of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a technique for detecting small amounts of (bio)chemical analytes has become increasingly popular in various fields. While gold and silver nanostructures have been extensively studied as SERS substrates, the availability of other types of substrates is currently expanding the applications of this spectroscopic method. Recently, researchers have begun exploring two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials (e.&#8201;g., graphene&#8208;like nanostructures) as substrates for SERS analysis. These materials offer unique optical properties, a well&#8208;defined structure, and the ability to modify their surface chemistry. As a contribution to advance this field, this concept article highlights the significance of understanding the chemical mechanism that underlies the experimental Raman spectra of chemisorbed molecules onto 2D materials&#8217; surfaces. Therefore, the article discusses recent advancements in fabricating substrates using 2D layered materials and the synergic effects of using their metallic composites for SERS applications. Additionally, it provides a new perspective on using Raman imaging in developing 2D materials as analytical platforms for Raman spectroscopy, an exciting emerging research area with significant potential.

         <title>The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear double duty? When coupled with heavy alkali counter&#8208;cations, depleted uranium (from nuclear fuel production) in the form of a uranyl triperoxide is a potent material for CO2 direct air capture (DAC). In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301687), M. Nyman and co&#8208;workers show how they isolated highly reactive Cs+ and Rb+ uranyl triperoxide materials and how the reactivity of the alkali uranyl triperoxide analogues increases with increasing alkali size, through polymerization in solution and through CO2 DAC in the solid state.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nuclear double duty?&lt;/b&gt; When coupled with heavy alkali counter-cations, depleted uranium (from nuclear fuel production) in the form of a uranyl triperoxide is a potent material for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; direct air capture (DAC). In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202301687"&gt;10.1002/chem.202301687&lt;/a&gt;), M. Nyman and co-workers show how they isolated highly reactive Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uranyl triperoxide materials and how the reactivity of the alkali uranyl triperoxide analogues increases with increasing alkali size, through polymerization in solution and through CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; DAC in the solid state.

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation of Indoles Using 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Zero&#8208;Valent Magnesium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ancient Eastern legend of master swordsmiths Gan Jiang and Mo Ye recounts their creation of legendary blades through a harmonious blend of raw materials, skilled craftsmanship, and the application of intense physical energy. The depicted process mirrors this fusion of elements, as the mechanical energy applied to magnesium, akin to the smiths&#8242; hammer strikes, triggers a transformative catalytic reaction that yields chemically enriched 2&#8208;arylindoles. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Yu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304231).

         <title>A pH&#8208;Sensitive Double Chromophore Fluorescent Dye for Live&#8208;Tracking of Lipophagy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live monitoring the fate of lipid droplets (LD) within cells! To visualize and quantify lipophagy in an easily applicable, non&#8208;toxic and protein label&#8208;free approach by means of fluorescence microscopy, a unique dye called Lipo&#8208;Fluddy&#8208;1 was developed. This synthetic dye is characterized by a high lipophilicity and contains two chromophores, one of which only fluoresces at low pH. Its usefulness was demonstrated by the flow cytometry investigation of lipophagy in several cell lines.







Abstract
Lipid droplet (LD) degradation provides metabolic energy and important building blocks for various cellular processes. The two major LD degradation pathways include autophagy (lipophagy), which involves delivery of LDs to autolysosomes, and lipolysis, which is mediated by lipases. While abnormalities in LD degradation are associated with various pathological disorders, our understanding of lipophagy is still rudimentary. In this study, we describe the development of a lipophilic dye containing two fluorophores, one of which is pH&#8208;sensitive and the other pH&#8208;stable. We further demonstrate that this &#8220;Lipo&#8208;Fluddy&#8221; can be used to visualize and quantify lipophagy in living cells, in an easily applicable and protein label&#8208;free approach. After estimating the ability of compound candidates to penetrate LDs, we synthesized several BODIPY and (pH&#8208;switchable) rhodol dyes, whose fluorescence properties (incl. their photophysical compatibility) were analyzed. Of three Lipo&#8208;Fluddy dyes synthesized, one exhibited the desired properties and allowed observation of lipophagy by fluorescence microscopy. Also, this dye proved to be non&#8208;toxic and suitable for the examination of various cell lines. Moreover, a method was developed to quantify the lipophagy process using flow cytometry, which could be applied in the future in the identification of lipophagy&#8208;related genes or in the screening of potential drugs against lipophagy&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Ether Naphthotube Host&#8208;Guest Complexes and [2]Rotaxanes with Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ether naphthotube was able to complex strongly with organic dications in organic solution to give an association constant up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. Thermodynamically, the host&#8208;guest interactions are exclusively enthalpically driven and enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation phenomena have been observed. Besides, a linear free energy correlation was observed between binding strengths and the Hammett substituent constants. The host&#8208;guest system can be directly applied for the preparation of more complex interlocked molecules by simple stoppering.







Abstract
The interactions between ether naphthotube and a series of dication guests in organic solution were investigated. It was found that ether naphthotube formed stable host&#8208;guest complexes selectively with these guests in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric ratio with association constants ranging from 102 to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1, which were confirmed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectra and ITC experiments. The host&#8208;guest interactions are driven by enthalpy change as the entropic factors are unfavorable. Positive correlations between &#916;H and &#916;S have been observed in the host&#8208;guest complexes. Furthermore, the para&#8208;substitution of the guests can significantly affect the binding affinities through a combination of field/inductive and resonance effects by following a linear free energy relationship. Based on the host&#8208;guest complexes composed of ether naphthotube and organic cations, two interlocked [2]rotaxanes were prepared by cationization reaction and Huisgen cycloaddition between the cations and the stopper components. The ether naphthotube&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes are useful for creating sophisticated interlocked molecules.

         <title>High&#8208;Intensity Circular Dichroism of Head&#8208;to&#8208;tail Regioregular Poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s in the Aggregated State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circular dichroism (CD) studies on poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s bearing a chiral side chain in the aggregated conditions were carried out. Little CD was observed in a solution form, while addition of a poor solvent into the polyphenylene solution induced aggregation and a strong CD was observed, accordingly. Applying the controlled degree of polymerization (DP) of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) in the use of bidentate diphosphine Chiraphos as a ligand for the nickel catalyst, the relationship of DP with CD strength was studied to reveal to show the highest CD at the DP = 84 (gabs = ca. 2 x 10&#8211;2). It was also found that the related aggregation was observed in good solvent 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane upon standing the solution at 4 &#176;C for 3&#8211;23 days to observe gabs = ca. 10&#8211;1. Studies on the substituent effect of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) suggested that CD behaviors were dependent on the type of non&#8208;chiral substituent on the aromatic ring as well as the side&#8208;chain chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Fatigue Resistance and Autonomous Switching of pH Responsive Hydrazones by Pulses of a Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemically triggered reversible switching of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones involves rotary motion&#8208;induced configurational changes, serving as a prototype for constructing an array of molecular machines. Typically, the configurational isomerization of such switches into two distinct forms (E/Z) occurs through the alteration of the pH the medium, achieved by successive additions of acid and base stimuli. However, this process results in intermittent operation due to the concomitant accumulation of salt after each cycle, limiting switching performance to only a few cycles (5&#8208;6). In this context, we introduce a novel strategy for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of hydrazones in acetonitrile using pulses of trichloroacetic acid as a chemical fuel. The use of this transient acid enabled reversible switching of hydrazones even after 50 cycles without causing significant fatigue. To test the broad viability of the fuel, a series of ortho/para&#8208;substituted hydrazones were synthesized and their switching performance was investigated. The analysis of kinetic data showed a strong dependency of switching operations including the lifetime of transient state, on the electronic properties of substituents. Finally, a distinct color change from yellow to orange due to reversible switching of the para&#8208;methoxy substituted hydrazone was employed for the creation of rewritable messages on commercially available paper.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo/mechanical/acidic multi&#8208;stimuli responses and information encryption design of acylhydrazone derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials have received much attention for being potential candidates of smart materials. However, the occurrence of polymorphism&#8208;driven stimuli responses in crystalline materials remains interesting but rare. Herein, three polymorphs of an acylhydrazone derivative, N'&#8208;[(E)&#8208;(1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methylidene] pyridine &#8208;4&#8208;carbohydrazide (BFMP) were prepared. Form&#8208;1 undergoes a photomechanical response via E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z&#8594;E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form&#8208;1. The solid&#8208;melt&#8208;solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid&#8208;solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form&#8208;2 to form&#8208;3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form&#8208;2 and form&#8208;3 provides a structural basis for the grinding&#8208;induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acid chromic property. The combination of photochromism and acid chromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Molybdenum Sulfide Nanoflowers as Electrodes for Efficient and Scalable Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) bridge the unique advantages of batteries and capacitors and are considered promising energy storage devices for hybrid vehicles and other electronic gadgets. Lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) have attained particular interest due to their higher energy and power density than traditional supercapacitor devices. The limited voltage window and the deterioration of anode materials upsurged the demand for efficient and stable electrode materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is a promising candidate for developing efficient and durable LICs due to its wide lithiation potential and unique layer structure, enhancing charge storage efficiency. Modifying the extrinsic features, such as the dimensions and shape at the nanoscale, serves as a potential path to overcome the sluggish kinetics observed in the LICs. Herein, the MoS2 nanoflowers have been synthesized through a hydrothermal route. The developed LIC exhibited a specific capacitance of 202.4 F g&#8209;1 at 0.25 A g&#8209;1 and capacitance retention of &gt; 90% over 5,000 cycles. Using an ether electrolyte improved the voltage window (2.0 V) and enhanced the stability performance. The ex&#8208;situ material characterization after the stability test reveals that the storage mechanism in MoS2&#8208;LICs is not diffusion&#8208;controlled. Instead, &#160;fast surface redox reactions, especially intercalation/deintercalation, are more prominent for charge storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;State Structure of a Long&#8208;Loop G&#8208;quadruplex Formed within Promoters of Plasmodium falciparum B var Genes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal loop of ten nucleotides. The G&#8208;quadruplex is formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2], named UpsB&#8208;Q&#8208;1. This sequence is found within promoters of the var genes of Plasmodium falciparum, which play a key role in malaria pathogenesis and evasion of the immune system. The [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed under physiologically relevant conditions exhibits a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding. Unique equilibrium of the two closely related 3D structures originates from a North&#8208;South repuckering of deoxyribose moiety of residue T27 in the lateral loop. Besides the 12 guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in loop regions are involved in interactions at both G&#8208;quartet&#8208;loop interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Equilibrium between Quinoid/Biradical Forms Enhancing Electrochemical Amphotericity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon dibenzo annulation on Thiele&#8217;s hydrocarbon (tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethane), the quinoid form and the biradical form adopt quite different geometries, and thus are no longer resonance structures. When these two forms can interconvert rapidly due to the small energy barrier (&#916;G&#8225;), the equilibrated mixture contains both forms in a ratio that is determined by the energy difference (&#916;Go) between the two forms. For a series of tetrakis[5&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl]&#8208;substituted derivatives, the more stable quinoid form and the metastable biradical form coexist in solution as an equilibrated mixture due to small &#916;G&#8225; (&lt; 15 kcal mol&#8211;1) and &#916;Go (1&#8208;4 kcal mol&#8211;1), in which the proportion of the two forms can be regulated by temperature. Since the biradical form can undergo easy two&#8208;electron (2e) oxidation to the corresponding dications as well as easy 2e reduction to the dianions, it exhibits very high electrochemical amphotericity. This character with a record&#8208;small span for not only the first oxidation and reduction potentials but also the second those, [E1sum &#8776; E2sum = E2ox &#8208; E2red = ca. 1.4 V], is attained through thermally enhanced conversion to the biradical form from the corresponding quinoid form, the latter of which is less amphoteric due to higher Eox and lower Ered values.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single Terminal [NiII&#8208;OH] Catalyst for Direct Julia&#8208;Type Olefination and &#945;&#8208;Alkylation Involving Sulfones and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A terminal [NiII&#8208;OH] complex 1, supported by triflamide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligands, showed divergent reactivity for the reaction of sulfone with alcohol, contingent on base concentration, temperature, and time. Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols with sulfones was achieved using one equiv. of base, whereas lowering base loading to 0.5 equiv. afforded &#945;&#8208;alkylated sulfones. Besides excellent substrate scope and selectivity, biologically active stilbene derivatives DMU&#8208;212, pinosylvin, resveratrol, and piceatannol were synthesized in high yield under Julia&#8208;type olefination conditions. An extensive array of controlled experiments and DFT calculations provide valuable insight on the reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation, Characterization and Reactivity of a High&#8208;valent Mononuclear Cobalt(IV)&#8208;diazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent Fe(IV)=O intermediates of metalloenzymes have inspired numerous efforts to generate synthetic analogs to mimic and understand their substrate oxidation reactivities. However, high&#8208;valent M(IV) complexes of late transition metals are rare. We have recently reported a novel Co(IV)&#8208;dinitrate complex (1&#8208;NO3) that activates sp3&#160;C&#8208;H bonds up to 87 kcal/mol. In this work, we have shown that the nitrate ligands in&#160;1&#8208;NO3&#160;can be replaced by&#160;azide,&#160;a more basic coordinating base, resulting in the formation of a more potent Co(IV)&#8208;diazide species (1&#8208;N3) that reacts with substrates (hydrocarbons and phenols) at faster rate constants and activates stronger C&#8208;H bonds than the parent complex&#160;1&#8208;NO3. We have characterized&#160;1&#8208;N3&#160;employing a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches. Our results clearly show that the coordination of azide leads to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the higher basicity of azide, these thermodynamic parameters contribute to the higher driving forces of&#160;1&#8208;N3&#160;than&#160;1&#8208;NO3&#160;for C&#8208;H bond activation. Our discoveries are thus insightful for designing more reactive bio&#8208;inspired high&#8208;valent late transition metal complexes for activating inert aliphatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanosynthesis of Oligopeptides by Coupling Peptide Segments of Different Lengths &#8211; Elucidating the Role of Cesium Carbonate in Ball Mill Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an idea for the synthesis of oligopeptides using a solvent&#8208;free ball milling approach. Our concept is inspired by block play, in which it is possible to construct different objects using segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. We prove that by having a library of short peptides and employing the ball mill mechanosynthesis (BMMS) method, peptides can be easily coupled to form different oligopeptides with the desired functional and biological properties. Optimizing the BMMS process we found that the best yields we obtained when TBTU and cesium carbonate were used as reagents. The role of Cs2CO3 in the coupling mechanism was followed on each stage of synthesis by 1H, 13C and 133Cs NMR employing Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) techniques. It was found that cesium carbonate acts not only as a base but is also responsible for the activation of substrates and intermediates. The unique information about the BMMS mechanism is based on the analysis of 2D NMR data. The power of BMMS is proved by the example of different peptide combinations, 2+2, 3+2, 4+2, 5+2 and 4+4. The tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octapeptides obtained under this project were fully characterized by MS and NMR techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Porphyrin Cavitand Breathing&#8208;In to Constrict Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;porphyrin cages have long been exploited to bind fullerenes selectively for various applications. The major consideration for an effective binding here had been the cavity size. Herein, we structurally demonstrate that a bis&#8208;Ni&#8208;porphyrin cavitand having even a smaller cavity can host a larger fullerene by a breathing and ruffling mechanism. It has also been shown that both the electronic and steric influence at the meso&#8208; positions of the porphyrin in fact dictate the binding character. The smaller cavity of 2NiD exhibits preferential binding for C70 over C60; however, surprisingly, the larger cavities in 2HD and 2NiTD display stronger affinities for C60 over the larger fullerene. We show here that the structural elasticity infused both by the metalloporphyrins and the connecting bridges play a major role in directing the binding. These conclusions have adequately been supported by structural and spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, the suitability of one of the conjugates for photoinduced charge&#8208;separation has been investigated using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. 2NiD has a charge separation timescale of ~0.8 ps, while charge recombination occurs at a longer timescale of ~920 ps.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Reductive Recycling of Cathode Materials of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is inevitably accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries in a dialectical manner. Spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are harboring the characteristics of hazardous waste and high&#8208;value resources, so efficient recycling is of great significance. The cathode material is considered as an interesting target for repurposing. Despite some important reviews give commendable emphasis to recycling technologies, there is still a dearth of exploration of recycling mechanisms. This deficiency of awareness highlights the need for further research and development in this area. This review aims to systematically review and thoroughly discuss the reduction reaction mechanism of each method regarding different cathode materials. And systematically digest the selection of reducing agent and the effect of reduction reaction on material regeneration are systematically digested, as well as the impact of the reduction reaction on the regeneration of materials. This review emphasizes the importance of balancing efficiency, economic and environmental benefits in reuse technologies. Finally, the review proposes an outlook on the opportunities and challenges facing the reuse of key materials for next&#8208;generation spent batteries aimed at promoting the green and sustainable development of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, circular economy and ecological balance.</dc:description>

         <title>Classical versus Collective Interactions in Asymmetric Trigonal Bipyramidal Alkaline Metal&#8210;Boron Halide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collective interactions are a novel type of chemical bond formed between metals and electron&#8208;rich substituents around an electron&#8208;poor central atom. So far only a limited number of candidates for having collective interactions are reported. In this work, we extend the newly introduced concept of collective bonding to a series of neutral boron complexes with the general formula M2BX3 (M = Li, Na, and K; X = F, Cl, and Br). Our state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ab initio computations suggest that these complexes form trigonal bipyramidal structures with a D3h to C3v distortion along the C3 axis of symmetry. The BX3 unit in the complexes distorts from planar to pyramidal akin to a sp3 hybridized atom. Interestingly, the interaction of the metals with the pyramidal side of BX3, where the lone pair in a hypothetical [BX3]2&#8210; should be located, is weaker than the interactions of metals with the inverted side, i.e., the middle of three halogen atoms. The origin of this stronger interaction can be explained by the formation of collective interactions between metals and halogen atoms as we explored via energy decomposition within the context of the theory of interacting quantum atoms, IQA.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To fill the need for environmentally sensitive fluorescent unnatural amino acids able to operate in the red region of the spectrum, we have designed and synthesized Alared, a red solvatochromic and fluorogenic amino acid derived from the Nile Red chromophore. The new unnatural amino acid can be easily integrated into bioactive peptides using classical solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The fluorescence quantum yield and the emission maximum of Alared&#8208;labeled peptides vary in a broad range depending on the peptide&#8217;s environment, making Alared a powerful reporter of biomolecular interactions. Due to its red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra, Alared&#8208;labeled peptides could be followed in living cells with minimal interference from cellular autofluorescence. Using ratiometric fluorescence microscopy, we were able to track the fate of the Alared&#8208;labeled peptide agonists of the apelin G protein&#8208;coupled receptor upon receptor activation and internalization. Due to its color&#8208;shifting environmentally sensitive emission, Alared allowed for distinguishing the fractions of peptides that are specifically bound to the receptor or unspecifically bound to different cellular membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Determining Structures of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Coated Zinc Dicarboxylate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thin films of crystalline solids with substantial free volume from organic chromophores and metal secondary building units (SBUs) are promising for engineering new optoelectronic properties through control of interchromophore coupling. Zn&#8208;based SBUs are especially relevant in this case because they avoid quenching the chromophore&#8217;s luminescence. We find that layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer spin&#8208;coating using Zn acetate dihydrate and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) and biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC) linkers easily produces crystalline thin films. However, analysis of the grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) data reveals the structures of these films vary significantly with the linker, and metal&#8208;to&#8208;linker molar ratio used for fabrication. Under equimolar conditions, H2BPDC creates a type of structure like that proposed for SURMOF&#8208;2, whereas H2BDC generates a different metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework. Large excess of Zn2+ ions causes the growth of layered zinc hydroxides, irrespective of the linker used. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide structural models with minimum total energy that are consistent with the experimentally observed diffractograms. In the broader sense, this work illustrates the importance in this field of careful structural determination, e.g., by utilizing GIWAXS and DFT simulations to determine the structure of the obtained crystalline metal&#8208;organic thin films, so properties can be rationally engineered and explained.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in semi&#8208;condensed figure&#8208;eight molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron delocalization and aromaticity was comparatively evaluated in recently synthesized figure&#8208;eight molecules made of two condensed U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moieties connected either by two single bonds or by two para&#8208;phenylene groups. The selected examples include molecules that incorporate eight&#8208;membered and sixteen&#8208;membered rings, as well as a doubly [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,4)cyclophane. We probe whether some electron delocalization could occur through the stereogenic single bonds in these molecules: Is aromaticity purely (semi&#8208;)local, or possibly also global in these molecules? It was concluded that the situation can go from a purely (semi&#8208;)local character when the dihedral angle at the connecting single bonds is large, such as in biphenyl, to a predominantly (semi&#8208;)local character with a minor global contribution when the dihedral angle is small, such as in the para&#8208;phenylene connectors of the [5]helicene&#8208;bridged cyclophane.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzoselenadiazole&#8208;Functionalized H&#8208;bonded Arylamide Foldamers: Solvent&#8208;Responsive Properties and Helix Self&#8208;Assembly Directed by Chalcogen Bonding in Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a series of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers bearing benzoselenadiazole ends with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior evidenced by 1D 1H NMR and 2D NOESY spectra. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy experiments show that the absorption wavelength of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers are significantly red&#8208;shifted due to the presence of benzoselenadiazole group. In addition, the crystal structures reveal that effective intermolecular dual Se&#183;&#183;&#183;N interactions between benzoselenadiazole groups induce further assembly of the monomers. Remarkably, supramolecular linear and double helices structures are constructed under the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and intermolecular chalcogen bonding. Additionally, 2D DOSY diffusion spectra and theoretical modelling based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed to explore the persistence of intermolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;N interactions beyond the crystalline state.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Detection and Idiosyncratic Removal of Copper by Nano&#8208;particle Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CaMOF@LSB) was designed and synthesized, exhibiting dual functionality for both selective detection and removal of Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. The framework's stability, including solvent and pH variations, was established with notable thermal resilience. Colorimetric Cu2+ detection (&#8805; 5 ppm) with a high capture capacity of 484.2 mg g&#8208;1 by CaMOF@LSB places this material among the few that ensure efficient colorimetric detection and high removal capabilities of Cu2+ ions. Batch adsorption experiments revealed pH&#8208;dependent behavior and competitive interactions. Langmuir and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetics models aptly described adsorption isotherms and kinetics, respectively. Thermodynamic assessments confirmed spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Mechanistically, nanoparticle deposition contributes to the Cu2+ uptake. CaMOF@LSB also exhibited one of the best removal behaviour of Cu2+ by means of oxide formation on the surface. Regeneration of CaMOF@LSB was achieved by simple sonication in 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution. &#160;The recyclability was also tested up to 5 cycles, and it exhibited a small decrease in adsorption capacity observed across the cycles. This research presents a promising avenue for addressing heavy metal pollution using metal&#8208;organic frameworks, thereby offering potential applications in water purification and environmental pollution monitoring and remediation.</dc:description>

DFT calculations including all f&#8208;electrons of samarium allowed a detailed mechanistic analysis of the synthetically valuable reductive cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones with samarium diiodide to bicyclic products. Details of the crucial electron&#8208;transfer processes, the diastereoselectivity, the regioselectivity and the influence of HMPA as ligand were correctly predicted.







Abstract
This study analyzes the samarium diiodide&#8208;promoted cyclizations of 5&#8208;arylpentan&#8208;2&#8208;ones to dearomatized bicyclic products utilizing density functional theory. The reaction involves a single electron transfer to the carbonyl group, which occurs synchronously with the rate determining cyclization event, and a second subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. These redox reactions are accurately computed employing small core pseudo potentials explicitly involving all f&#8208;electrons of samarium. Comparison of the energies of the possible final products rules out thermodynamic control of the observed regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Kinetic control via appropriate transition states is correctly predicted, but to obtain reasonable energy levels the influence of the co&#8208;solvent hexamethylphosphortriamide has to be estimated by using a correction term. The steric effect of the bulky samarium ligands is decisive for the observed stereoselectivity. Carbonyl groups in para&#8208;position of the aryl group change the regioselectivity of the cyclization and lead to spiro compounds. The computations suggest again kinetic control of this deviating outcome. However, the standard mechanism has to be modified and the involvement of a complex activated by two SmI2 moieties is proposed in which two electrons are transferred simultaneously to form the new C&#8722;C bond. Computation of model intermediates show the feasibility of this alternative+ mechanism.

         <title>Hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 encapsulated Pd catalysts for highly selective   hydrogenation of furfural  to furfuryl alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFA) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) is regarded as attractive transformation to achieve the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass resources. However, the conventional supported catalysts are significantly restricted by their narrow pore size, ununiform dispersion and easy leaching or aggregation of catalytic sites. Herein, we designed hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;as the support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) to achieve the highly active and selective conversion of FFA to FA. Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;exhibited 96.8 % conversion of FFA with satisfactory selectivity reaching up to 92.4 % at 80 &#176;C, 0.5 MPa H2&#160;in isopropanol solvent within 6 h. More importantly, as&#8208;prepared Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;catalyst exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, as well as good universality toward a series of hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>A Magnesium Binding Site And The Anomeric Effect Regulate The Abiotic Redox Chemistry Of Nicotinamide Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox active molecule that is universally found in biology. Despite the importance and simplicity of this molecule, few reports exist that investigate which molecular features are important for the activity of this ribodinucleotide. By exploiting the nonenzymatic reduction and oxidation of NAD+ by pyruvate and methylene blue, respectively, we were able to identify key molecular features necessary for the intrinsic activity of NAD+ through kinetic analysis. Such features may explain how NAD+ could have been selected early during the emergence of life. Simpler molecules, such as nicotinamide, that lack an anomeric carbon are incapable of accepting electrons from pyruvate. The phosphate moiety inhibits activity in the absence of metal ions but facilitates activity at physiological pH and model prebiotic conditions by recruiting catalytic Mg2+. Reduction proceeds through consecutive single electron transfer events. Of the derivatives tested, including nicotinamide mononucleotide, nicotinamide riboside, 3&#8208;(aminocarbonyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropyl)pyridinium, 1&#8208;methylnicotinamide, and nicotinamide, only NAD+ and nicotinamide mononucleotide would be capable of efficiently accepting and donating electrons from and to pyruvate within a nonenzymatic electron transport chain. The data are consistent with early metabolic chemistry exploiting NAD+ or nicotinamide mononucleotide and not simpler molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of Vitamin B6&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Pyridinium Salts towards the Application in Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridoxal hydrochloride, a vitamin B6 vitamer, was synthetically converted to a series of diverse redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions, and two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory&#8208;scale redox flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10 mM in 0.1 M NaOH. In these tests, the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. Both CV analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two&#8208;electron process. To explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. Computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (ET), then proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and finally proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol. 1H NMR deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last PT step is not reversible in 0.1 M NaOH, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. The apparent reversibility observed in CV at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the PT step at the timescale of the measurement.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Grown on the Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide to Realize High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Glucose Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve glucose detection, a series of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide, HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) are successfully synthesized. We explored the dosage and the synergistic effect of bimetals on the grown of nanomaterials as well as the electrochemical sensing performance. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.







Abstract
Glucose holds significant importance in disease diagnosis as well as beverage quality monitoring. The high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical sensor plays a crucial role in the electrochemical conversion technology. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are provided with high specific surface area and redox activity that are widely used in electrochemistry. Conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) perfectly combine the structural controllability of organic materials with the long&#8208;range ordering of inorganic materials that possess the characteristic of high electron mobility. Based on the above considerations, the combination of Ni(OH)2 and Ni&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) as an electrode modification material is designed to enhance electrochemical performance. In this work, to improve glucose detection, a sequence of Ni(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;HHTP and NiM&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP (M=Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, LDH=layered double hydroxide) are successfully synthesised by doping metals into Ni&#8208;HHTP and Ni(OH)2, respectively. As a result, NiCu&#8208;LDH@Ni&#8208;HHTP showed the best excellent glucose detection sensitivity.

         <title>In Situ Detection of Nucleic Acids in Extracellular Vesicles via Membrane Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept summarizes recent advancements in detecting extracellular vesicle (EV) nucleic acids via membrane fusion. These approaches mainly are classified into 1) universal and 2) targeted membrane fusion approaches, and their mechanisms, applications in biomedical diagnostics and the challenges and opportunities are discussed.







Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry diverse biomolecules (e.&#8201;g., nucleic acids, proteins) for intercellular communication, serving as important markers for diseases. Analyzing nucleic acids derived from EVs enables non&#8208;invasive disease diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Membrane fusion, a fundamental cellular process wherein two lipid membranes merge, facilitates cell communication and cargo transport. Building on this natural phenomenon, recent years have witnessed the emergence of membrane fusion&#8208;based strategies for the detection of nucleic acids within EVs. These strategies entail the encapsulation of detection probes within either artificial or natural vesicles, followed by the induction of membrane fusion with EVs to deliver probes. This innovative approach not only enables in&#8197;situ detection of nucleic acids within EVs but also ensures the maintenance of structural integrity of EVs, thus preventing nucleic acid degradation and minimizing the interference from free nucleic acids. This concept categorizes approaches into universal and targeted membrane fusion strategies, and discusses their application potential, and challenges and future prospects.

         <title>Stabilization of the Neutral [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) Radical by Hetero&#8208;Bimetal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hetero&#8208;bimetal coordination strategy was successfully applied to stabilize a ring&#8208;expanded porphyrin radical, [25]Hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0), i.&#8201;e., [25]Rosarin, in its neutral form by a mixed BF2/Rh(CO)2 coordination in the core.







Abstract
Stabilization of hexaphyrin(1.0.1.0.1.0) (named &#8220;rosarin&#8221;) in its 25&#960; radical state is achieved using a hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination strategy. The antiaromatic BF2 complex B&#8208;1 was first synthesized, and then rhodium ion was inserted into B&#8208;1 to produce the BF2/Rh(CO)2 mixed complex Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 as a highly air&#8208;stable radical. The structures of B&#8208;1 and Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, and the antiaromatic or radical character was identified by various spectroscopy evidence and theoretical calculations. Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 exhibits excellent redox properties, enabling amphoteric aromatic&#8208;antiaromatic conversion to their 24/26&#960; states. Compared to the 24/26&#960; conjugation systems on the same skeleton, Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1 has the narrowest electrochemical and optical band gaps, with the longest absorption band at 1010&#8197;nm. The ring&#8208;current analysis reveals intense paratropic currents for B&#8208;1 and co&#8208;existing diatropic&#8208;paratropic currents for Rh&#8208;B&#8208;1. This hetero&#8208;bimetal&#8208;coordination system provides a novel platform for organic radical stabilization on porphyrinoids, showing the prospect of modulating ligand oxidation states through rational coordination design.

         <title>Facilitating Electron Transfer by Resizing Cyclocarbon Acceptor from C18 to C16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of low reorganization energy and high electron affinity makes the C16 cyclocarbon a better electron acceptor than the C18 molecule. In complexes with strong electron donors, photoinduced charge separation occurs within picoseconds.







Abstract
Recent advances in synthetic methods, combined with tip&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface chemistry, have enabled the formation of numerous cyclocarbon molecules. Here, we investigate computationally the experimentally studied C16 and C18 molecules as well as their van der Waals (vdW) complexes with several typical donor and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate a remarkable electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of cyclocarbon molecules. The vdW complexes of C16 and C18 exhibit a thermodynamically favorable photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor partner to the cyclocarbons that occurs on a picosecond time scale. The lower reorganization energy of C16 compared to C18 leads to a significant acceleration of the ET reactions.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of PdCuAg and CeO2 Nanowires Hybrid with Abundant Heterojunction Interface for Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid of PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires with structural (abundant heterojunction/interfaces and ultrathin nanowire structure) and compositional advantages were facile prepared by one&#8208;pot method, thus embracing enhanced electrocatalytic performance for ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Introducing CeO2 into Pd&#8208;based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO2 nanowires hybrid via a one&#8208;pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO2) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Introducing CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into Pd-based nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic reactions is a good way to solve the intermediate toxicity problem and improve the catalytic performance. Here we reported a simple strategy to synthesize the PdCuAg and CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires hybrid via a one-pot synthesis process under strong nanoconfined effect of specific surfactant as templates. Owing to the structural (ultrathin nanowires, abundant heterojunction/interfaces between metal and metal oxide) and compositional (Pd, Cu, Ag, CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) advantages, the hybrid showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity (6.06&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stability, accelerated reaction rate, and reduced activation energy toward electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Plasticity of a Viral Terpene Synthase, OILTS, that Shows Non&#8211;Specific Metal Cofactor Binding and Metal&#8211;dependent Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OILTS, a terpene synthase found from a giant virus, exhibits high plasticity to metal cofactors. It can use even Zn2+ known to severely decrease the activities of many terpene synthases. In addition, when Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ were used as the cofactors, the profile of enzyme product was changed. The functional plasticity may benefit the virus in adapting to diverse environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.







Abstract
OILTS is a viral class I terpene synthase found from the giant virus Orpheovirus IHUMI&#8211;LCC2. It exhibits a unique structure and demonstrates high plasticity to metal cofactors, allowing it to biosynthesize different cyclic terpene frameworks. Notably, while OILTS produces only (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8211;4&#8211;ol with the most common cofactor, Mg2+, it also biosynthesizes a different cyclic terpene, (+)&#8208;cubebol, with Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+, presenting a rare instance of cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme catalysis. This is the first report of (+)&#8208;cubebol biosynthesis, to our knowledge. In addition, OILTS can uptake Zn2+ as a cofactor, which is uncommon among ordinary terpene synthases. These findings suggest that OILTS&#8242;s functional plasticity may benefit the virus in diverse host environments, highlighting potential evolutionary implications.

         <title>Mimicking Ozonolysis via Mechanochemistry: Internal Alkynes to 1,2&#8208;Diketones using H5IO6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing periodic acid as an environmentally benign oxidizing agent, this study introduces a novel mechanochemical method that mimics ozonolysis to convert internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, showcasing effective emulation of ozone's reactivity. Notably, this oxidation occurs at room temperature in aerobic conditions, eliminating the need for toxic transition metals, hazardous oxidants, or expensive solvents. Through control experiments validating the mechanism, substantial evidence supports a concerted reaction pathway. This progress marks a significant stride toward cleaner and more efficient chemical synthesis, mitigating the environmental impact of conventional processes. Assessing the green chemistry metrics in both solvent&#8208;free and previously reported solvent&#8208;based methods, our eco&#8208;friendly protocol demonstrates an E&#8208;factor of 7.40, a 51.7% atom economy, a 45.5% atom efficiency, 100% carbon efficiency, and 11.9% reaction mass efficiency when solvents are not used.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Amino Acid and Peptide Supramolecular Architectures through Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are attracting considerable research interest, especially in the biomedical field and in materials science, thanks to their ability to self&#8208;assemble into peculiar supramolecular structures. The conformational changes induced by the presence of fluorine atoms obviously affect their functions, as well as the biological activity of the deriving peptides and proteins. Here, we will briefly describe the main effects of fluorination on the aggregation behavior of such building blocks, focusing in particular on their improved tendency to form fibrils, and gels therefrom. Our aim is to underline the promising potential of fluorination as a tool to affect the self&#8208;assembly features of amino acids, both when used alone and when inserted into polypeptide sequences. The ability of fluorine to influence physical, chemical, and structural properties of these substrates offers the possibility to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Types of Phyllobilins in a Fern &#8208; Molecular Reporters of the Evolution of Chlorophyll Breakdown in the Paleozoic Era</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breakdown of chlorophyll (Chl), as studied in angiosperms, follows the pheophorbide a oxygenase/phyllobilin (PaO/PB) pathway, furnishing linear tetrapyrroles, named phyllobilins (PBs). In an investigation with fern leaves we have discovered iso&#8208;phyllobilanones (iPBs) with an intriguingly rearranged and oxidized carbon skeleton. We report here a key second group of iPBs from the fern and on their structure analysis. Previously, these additional Chl&#8208;catabolites escaped their characterization, since they exist in aqueous media as mixtures of equilibrating isomers. However, their chemical dehydration furnished stable iPB&#8208;derivatives that allowed the delineation of the enigmatic structures and chemistry of the original natural catabolites. The structures of all fern&#8208;iPBs reflect the early core steps of a PaO/PB&#8208;type pathway and the PB&#8208;to&#8208;iPB carbon skeleton rearrangement. A striking further degradative chemical ring&#8208;cleavage was observed, proposed to consume singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hence, Chl&#8208;catabolites may play a novel active role in detoxifying cellular 1O2. The critical deviations from the PaO/PB pathway, found in the fern, reflect evolutionary developments of Chl&#8208;breakdown in the green plants in the Paleozoic era.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Triazole&#8208;Derived Mesoionic Imines with Ferrocenyl Substituents and their Metal Complexes: Directed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, Unusual C&#8208;H Activation and Ion&#8208;Pair Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein the synthesis, characterization and complexation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted MIIs (mesoionic imines) and their metal complexes. In the free MIIs, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between the imine&#8208;N and the C&#8208;H bonds of the ferrocenyl substituents both in the solid state and in solution. The influence of this hydrogen bonding is so strong that complexation of the MIIs with [IrCp*Cl2]2 yields unique six&#8208;membered iridacycles via C&#8208;H&#8208;activation of the corresponding C&#8208;H&#8208;site at the Fc&#8208;substituent and not the Ph&#8208;substituent. This result is in contrast to previous reports in which always a preferential C&#8208;H activation at the phenyl substituent is observed in competitive reactions in the presence of ferrocenyl substituents. The corresponding Ir complexes formed after in&#8208;situ halide exchange reaction exist in either [Ir&#8208;I] contact or as [Ir]+I&#8208; solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs depending on the solvent polarity. The iodide coordinated and solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs display drastically different physical properties. The TEP (Tolman&#8208;electronic&#8208;parameter) of these ligands was determined and lines up with previously reported MII&#8208;ligands. The redox properties were investigated by a combination of electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods. We show here how non&#8208;covalent interactions can have a drastic influence on the physical and chemical properties of these new class of compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triply Linked&#160;Copper(III) Dicarbacorrole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer (7) was synthesized from a new meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor (6) via an oxidative fusion reaction by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 7 adopts a flat conformation with a length as ca. 15.946 &#197; and a width as 6.903 &#197;, which can be regarded as a short carbaporphyrinoid tape. Two coordinated Cu ions keeps the +3 oxidation state in 7, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is in sharp contrast to the Osuka&#8217;s triply linked tetrapyrrolic corrole dimers, where the inner 3NH form is not stable and thus can only act as a divalent ligand. Due to the non&#8208;aromatic nature of dicarbacorrole macrocycle, the largely decreased HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of 7 are best ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between two dipyrromethene&#8208;type chromophores. To our knowledge, this is the first fully fused carbaporphyrinoid dimer with &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linkages prepared to date</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer (7) was synthesized from a new meso-meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor (6) via an oxidative fusion reaction by 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). Single crystal X-ray structure of 7 adopts a flat conformation with a length as ca. 15.946 &#197; and a width as 6.903 &#197;, which can be regarded as a short carbaporphyrinoid tape. Two coordinated Cu ions keeps the +3 oxidation state in 7, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is in sharp contrast to the Osuka&#8217;s triply linked tetrapyrrolic corrole dimers, where the inner 3NH form is not stable and thus can only act as a divalent ligand. Due to the non-aromatic nature of dicarbacorrole macrocycle, the largely decreased HOMO-LUMO gap and red-shifted absorption of 7 are best ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between two dipyrromethene-type chromophores. To our knowledge, this is the first fully fused carbaporphyrinoid dimer with &#946;-&#946;, meso-meso, &#946;-&#946; triply linkages prepared to date&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy Barrier and Gaps between Two Excited States in a Dual&#8208;Emissive Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thorough understanding of the internal conversion process between excited states is important for designing ideal multiple emissive materials. However, it is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barrier and energy gaps between the excited states of a compound. For a long time, it is dubious if what was measured is the energy gap or energy barrier between two excited states. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (2), which shows dual emission in solution. Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence measurements show that the two emission bands in hexane are corresponding to two different excited states. The ratio of the emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures. Thus, the energy barrier and energy gaps between the two excited states of 2 can be experimentally estimated.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators have the ability to convert the absorbed X&#8208;ray irradiation into ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators with excellent persistent luminescence are emerging as a new class of persistent luminescent materials recently. They have attracted great attention due to their unique "self&#8208;luminescence" characteristic and potential applications. In this review, we comb through and focus on current developments of lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PerLSs), including their persistent luminescence mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of persistent luminescent properties (e.g. emission wavelength, intensity, and duration time), as well as their promising applications (e.g. information storage, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, bio&#8208;imaging, and photodynamic therapy). We hope this review will provide valuable guidance for the future development of PerLSs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene based Cu(I) metallocycle constituting the prototype for reversibly photoswitchable (3d&lt;M&#8208;)metallocycles (i.&#8201;e. without disassembly) is presented. Its ultrafast dynamics and the yield of the respective photostationary state reveal strong similarities with archetypical azobenzene. The unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD elucidates the interplay of dynamics and solvation. Coupled with quantum chemical calculations, this interdisciplinary approach reveals a non&#8208;cooperative photoisomerization.







Abstract
The novel photoswitchable ligand 3,3&#8217;&#8208;Azobenz(metPA)2 (1) is used to prepare a [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 metallocycle (2), whose photoisomerization was characterized using static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. Optical studies demonstrate the highly quantitative and reproducible photoinduced cyclic E/Z switching without decay of the complex. Accordingly and best to our knowledge, [Cu2(1)2](BF4)2 constitutes the first reversibly photoswitchable (3d)&#8208;metallocycle based on azobenzene. The photoinduced multiexponential dynamics in the sub&#8208;picosecond to few picosecond time domain of 1 and 2 have been assessed. These ultrafast dynamics as well as the yield of the respective photostationary state (PSSZ = 65&#8201;%) resemble the behavior of archetypical azobenzene. Also, the innovative pump&#8208;probe laser technique of gas phase transient photodissociation (&#964;&#8208;PD) in a mass spectrometric ion trap was used to determine the intrinsic relaxation dynamics for the isolated complex. These results are consistent with the results from femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) in solution, emphasizing the azobenzene&#8208;like dynamics of 2. This unique combination of fs&#8208;TA and &#964;&#8208;PD enables valuable insights into the prevailing interplay of dynamics and solvation. Both analyses (in solution and gas phase) and quantum chemical calculations reveal a negligible effect of the metal coordination on the switching mechanism and electronic pathway, which suggests a non&#8208;cooperative isomerization process.

         <title>Structural Chemistry of Titanium (IV) Oxo Clusters, Part 2: Clusters Without Carboxylate or Phosphonate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review completes a series of three articles which provide a comprehensive coverage of the structural chemistry of polynuclear titanium oxo compounds. The interplay of structure&#8208;influencing coordination characteristics of the ligands and preferred arrangement of the Ti/O polyhedra in the cluster cores is worked out.







Abstract
Homometallic titanium oxo clusters (TOC) are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters. In a previous article, TOC structures with carboxylato and phosphonato ligands were reviewed and categorized. This work is now extended to clusters with other ligands. Comparison of the different cluster types shows how the interplay between condensation of the titanium polyhedra by means of bridging oxygen atoms and the coordination characteristics of the ligands influences the cluster structures and allows working out basic construction principles of the cluster core.

         <title>Bimodal Glycosyl Donors as an Emerging Approach Towards a General Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective construction of the anomeric bond has constituted one of the greatest challenges in modern organic chemistry. In recent years, examples of &#8220;bimodal&#8221; glycosyl donors have emerged, demonstrating excellent stereocontrol for both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers. This mini review explores the reactivity and scope of these donors and highlights how they can streamline complex glycan construction.







Abstract
Organic synthesis provides an accessible route to preparative scale biological glycans, although schemes to access these complex structures are often complicated by preparation of multiple monosaccharide building blocks. Bimodal glycosyl donors capable of forming both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers selectively, are an emerging tactic to reduce the required number of individual synthetic components in glycan construction. This review discusses examples of bimodal donors in the literature, and how they achieve their stereocontrol for both anomers. Notable examples include a bespoke O&#8208;2 benzyl protecting group, a strained glycal for reaction using organometallic catalysis, and a simple perbenzylated donor optimised for stereoselective glycosylation through extensive reaction tuning.

         <title>Parametric Analysis of Donor Activation for Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a semi&#8208;automated assay to assign TA (activation temperature) and TD (decomposition temperature) to glycosyl donors, we established correlations to the assigned temperatures to both structural effects (protecting groups and monosaccharide core) and other experimental parameters (reagent concentrations).







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of complex oligosaccharides relies on efficient and highly reproducible glycosylation reactions. The outcome of a glycosylation is contingent upon several environmental factors, such as temperature, acidity, the presence of residual moisture, as well as the steric, electronic, and conformational aspects of the reactants. Each glycosylation proceeds rapidly and with a high yield within a rather narrow temperature range. For better control over glycosylations and to ensure fast and reliable reactions, a systematic analysis of 18 glycosyl donors revealed the effect of reagent concentration, water content, protecting groups, and structure of the glycosyl donors on the activation temperature. With these insights, we parametrize the first step of the glycosylation reaction to be executed reliably and efficiently.

         <title>Perfluoroalkylation of Triarylamines by EDA Complexes and Ulterior Sensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;Electrocyclization to Perfluoroalkylated Endo&#8208;Carbazoles. Mechanistic and Photophysical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the chemoselective perfluoroalkylation of triarylamines (TAA) is accomplished by visible light activation of a halogen&#8208;bonding complex between TAA and perfluoroalkyl iodides RF&#8722;I. The resulting perfluoroalkylated triarylamines, TAA&#8208;RF, undergo stereospecific unprecedented 6&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization under photosensitized reaction in acetone to endo&#8208;carbazoles exclusively in quantitative yields.







Abstract
Blue LEDs&#8208;irradiation of a mixture of N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and perfluoroalkyl iodides (RF&#8722;I) &#8211; Electron Donor Acceptor (EDA)&#8208;complex &#8211; in the presence of triphenylamines (TPAs) in an aqueous solvent mixture afforded mono&#8208;perfluoroalkylated triphenylamines (RF&#8722;TPA) in good yields. These RF&#8722;TPA were further subjected to acetone&#8208;sensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization at 315&#8197;nm&#8208;irradiation affording exclusively perfluoroalkylated endo&#8208;carbazole derivatives (RF&#8722;CBz) in quantitative yields. Mechanistic studies and photophysical properties of products are studied.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bis&#8208;Norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not only the production, but especially the storage of renewable energy is crucial for a sustainable society. A major challenge in the field of molecular solar thermal energy storage is designing visible light&#8208;absorbing photoswitches with long energy storage half&#8208;lives. Five novel visible light&#8208;absorbing norbornadiene dimers were prepared, with half&#8208;lives up to 23.0&#8197;hours, and high energy densities up to 379.3&#8197;kJ/kg.







Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair represents a promising system for application in molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). Often, the NBD derivatives have very limited overlap with the solar spectrum, and substitution to redshift the absorption leads to a decrease in the gravimetric energy density. Dimeric systems mitigate this factor because two switches can &#8216;share&#8217; a substituent. Here, we present five new NBD dimers with red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. One dimer features the most red&#8208;shifted absorption onset (539&#8197;nm) and a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption maximum (404&#8197;nm) for NBD systems reported so far, without compromising thermal half&#8208;life. Promising properties for high&#8208;performance MOST applications are demonstrated, such as high absorption onsets reaching 539&#8197;nm, and energy densities of 379&#8197;kJ/kg, while still maintaining long half&#8208;lives of the metastable isomer, up to 23&#8197;hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Synthesis of Cobalt Polynitrides: Unveiling Intriguing Crystal Structures and Nitridation Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridation behaviour of cobalt nitride unfolds along a progressive path under high&#8208;pressure conditions, as investigated using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, combined with synchrotron XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and density funtional theory. Our observations reveal a sequence of CoN6 octahedral framework transformations, including face&#8208;sharing (in CoN), edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and isolated (in CoN5) polyhedra. These changes align with the polymerization of nitrogen within the crystal.







Abstract
In this study, we conduct extensive high&#8208;pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt&#8208;nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, first&#8208;principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high&#8208;pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs&#8208;type CoN, and marcasite&#8208;type CoN2 within the pressure range of 50&#8211;90&#8197;GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co3N2, Pnma&#8208;CoN and two polynitrides, CoN3 and CoN5, within the pressure range of 90&#8211;120&#8197;GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN3 feature branched&#8208;type nitrogen trimers (N3) and CoN5 show &#960;&#8208;bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN6 polyhedral frameworks transit from face&#8208;sharing (in CoN) to edge&#8208;sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and finally to isolated (in CoN5). Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between structure evolution, bonding arrangements, and high&#8208;pressure synthesis in polynitrides, expanding the knowledge for the development of advanced energy materials

         <title>AuNP/MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 Nanocomposite for the Valorization of Nitroarene by Green Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the in&#8197;situ formation of small gold nanoparticles inside the iron carboxylate metal organic framework MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2. The resulting nanocomposite was tested in the hydrogenation of diverse nitroarenes, reaching high conversion rates in a sustainable reaction, as proven by green metrics.







Abstract
The efficiency of a catalytic process is assessed based on conversion, yield, and time effectiveness. However, these parameters are insufficient for evaluating environmentally sustainable research. As the world is urged to shift towards green catalysis, additional factors such as reaction media, raw material availability, sustainability, waste minimization and catalyst biosafety, need to be considered to accurately determine the efficacy and sustainability of the process. By combining the high porosity and versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and the activity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), efficient, cyclable and biosafe composite catalysts can be achieved. Thus, a composite based on AuNPs and the nanometric flexible porous iron(III) aminoterephthalate MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 was successfully synthesized and fully characterized. This nanocomposite was tested as catalyst in the reduction of nitroarenes, which were identified as anthropogenic water pollutants, reaching cyclable high conversion rates at short times for different nitroarenes. Both synthesis and catalytic reactions were performed using green conditions, and even further tested in a time&#8208;optimizing one&#8208;pot synthesis and catalysis experiment. The sustainability and environmental impact of the catalytic conditions were assessed by green metrics. Thus, this study provides an easily implementable synthesis, and efficient catalysis, while minimizing the environmental and health impact of the process.

         <title>Electrochemical Dehydration of Dicarboxylic Acids to Their Cyclic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical dehydrative reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. The electrochemically generated anhydrides can be directly employed for amidation reactions. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by 18O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate during electrolysis.







Abstract
An intramolecular electrochemical dehydration reaction of dicarboxylic acids to their cyclic anhydrides is presented. This electrolysis allows dicarboxylic acids as naturally abundant, inexpensive, safe, and readily available starting materials to be transformed into carboxylic anhydrides under mild reaction conditions. No conventional dehydration reagent is required. The obtained cyclic anhydrides are highly valuable reagents in organic synthesis, and in this report, we use them in&#8208;situ for acylation reactions of amines to synthesize amides. This work is part of the recent progress in electrochemical dehydration, which &#8211; in contrast to electrochemical dehydrogenative reactions for example &#8211; is an underexplored field of research. The reaction mechanism was investigated by 18O isotope labeling, revealing the formation of sulfate by electrochemical oxidation and hydrolysis of the thiocyanate&#8208;supporting electrolyte. This transformation is not a classical Kolbe electrolysis, because it is non&#8208;decarboxylative, and all carbon atoms of the carboxylic acid starting material are contained in the carboxylic anhydride. In total, 20 examples are shown with NMR yields up to 71&#8201;%.

         <title>Steric effects on single&#8208;molecule conductance in flat&#8208;lying phenanthrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A previous combined experimental and theoretical study&#160;found that the position of anchoring groups on a phenanthrene&#160;(PHE) backbone played a large role in determining&#160;the single&#8208;molecule conductance of the PHE derivative.&#160;However, a consistent 0.1 G0 feature was found across all&#160;PHE derivatives. To understand this, the previously investigated&#160;PHE derivatives were placed flat on a simulated Au&#160;substrate with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip&#160;over PHE and conductance was calculated using the non&#8208;equilibrium&#160;Green&#8217;s function technique in conjunction with&#160;density functional theory (NEGF&#8208;DFT). The location of the&#160;tip was varied to find the most conductive and most energetically&#160;favorable arrangements, which did not coincide.&#160;Furthermore, the variation in conductance found in erect&#160;junctions was not calculated to appear when PHE derivatives&#160;were lying flat, with all derivatives calculated to have&#160;conductance values around 0.1 G0.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly&#8208;Fused Ni(II)Porphyrin Conjugated Polymers with Blocked meso&#8208;positions: Impact on Electrocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative coupling reaction of two Ni(II) porphyrins meso&#8208;substituted with three and four phenyl groups, Ni(II) 5,10,15&#8208;(triphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh3P) and Ni(II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetraphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh4P) respectively, was investigated in a oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) process. Irrespective of the number of meso&#8208;substituents, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry evidences the formation of oligomeric species containing up to five porphyrin units. UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and XPS analyses of the oCVD films highlighted a strong dependence of the intermolecular coupling reaction with the substrate temperature. Specifically, higher substrate temperatures yield lowering of valence band maxima and reduction of the band gap. The formation of conjugated polymeric assemblies results in increased conductivities as compared to their sublimed counterparts. Yet, electrocatalytic measurements exhibit water oxidation onset overpotentials (308 mV for pNiPh3P and 343 mV for pNiPh4P) comparatively higher than the onset overpotential measured for the oCVD film from Ni(II) 5,15&#8208;(diphenyl)porphyrin (pNiPh2P), i.e. 283 mV. Although DFT and comparative oCVD studies suggest the formation of directly fused porphyrins involving b&#8208;b &#160;linkages when reacting tetra&#8208;meso&#8208;substituted porphyrins, the present findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (b&#8208;b/meso&#8208;meso/b&#8208;b or meso&#8208;b/b&#8208;meso) is essential for Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers to enable a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling operating mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and durable catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Patterning offers an efficient way to quantitatively enhance and enlarge material properties and functionalities, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation in various scientific domains. By precisely controlling the spatial arrangement of materials at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale, patterning enables the exploitation of inherent material properties in novel ways. In addition, it generates new properties, leading to the development of advanced devices and applications. This article highlights the significant contributions of spatially controlled patterning in chemistry, particularly in generating new functional properties and devices, discussing some representative articles. Examples include the use of unconventional patterning techniques for surface functionalization, as well as the application of spatial confinement in improving material properties and controlling crystallization processes. Furthermore, the discussion extends to creating new devices, such as optical storage media and sensors, through spatial organization of materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy that combines oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis allows the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes, a motif that is prevalent in natural products and synthetic bioactive compounds. In the first step, &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes and propargylic alcohols are transformed into &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with excellent optical purities (&gt;90% ee) via oxidative umpolung with DDQ and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. Subsequent gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation affords the isochromane products with retention of the quaternary stereocenter. A second approach explores the use of allylic alcohols as reaction partners for the oxidative coupling to furnish &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with generally lower enantiopurities. Stereoretentive cyclization to isochromane products is achieved via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation with allylic acetates as a reactive handle. A number of synthetic elaborations and a biological study on these &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes highlight the potential applicability of the presented method.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The natural product (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal secondary metabolite which displays promising anti&#8208;cancer and immunomodulatory activity. Our previous syntheses of (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton&#8217;s tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure&#8208;based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8208;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B&#8208;based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry&#8208;based Disaccharide Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear and acidic polysaccharides. They are ubiquitous molecules, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Despite being structurally simple at first glance, with a repeating backbone of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine dimers, GAGs display a highly complex structure, which predominantly results from their heterogeneous sulfation patterns. The commonly applied method for compositional analysis of all GAGs is "disaccharide analysis." In this process, GAGs are enzymatically depolymerized into disaccharides, derivatized with a fluorescent label, and then analysed through liquid chromatography. The limiting factor in the high throughput analysis of GAG disaccharides is the time&#8208;consuming liquid chromatography. To address this limitation, we here utilized trapped ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (TIM&#8208;MS) for the separation of isomeric GAG disaccharides, which reduces the measurement time from hours to a few minutes. A full set of disaccharides comprises twelve structures, with eight possessing isomers. Most disaccharides cannot be differentiated by TIM&#8208;MS in underivatized form. Therefore, we developed chemical modifications to reduce sample complexity and enhance differentiability. Quantification is performed using stable isotope labelled standards, which are easily available due to the nature of the performed modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparison of Classical and Green RPLC Methods in the Determination of pKa Values of Some Piperazine Group Antihistamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, protonation constant values and liquid chromatographic behaviors of hydrophobic cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, hydroxyzine, cinnarizine, cetirizine, meclizine, and buclizine in some water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures were examined for the first time using classical and green reverse phase liquid chromatography methods. In the isocratic study, the relationship of the retention time and mobile phase pH in water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures containing acetonitrile (45, 50, 55, 60, 65, v/v), methanol (60, 65, 70, 75, v/v) and ethanol (45, 50, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 65, v/v) were determined at 37 &#176;C.&#160; In the study, XBridge C18 and Gemini NX C18 columns suitable for the chemical properties of basic compounds were used. The obtained liquid chromatographic data were analyzed using the linear solvation energy relationship methodology and the SOLVER program. The aqueous protonation constant values of the investigated compounds were calculated using the linear relationship between the protonation constant data calculated in studied binary mixtures and some macroscopic constant values of the solvents used. The greenness of methods developed using three different solvents was evaluated with the Analytical Greenness Metric Approach, the Green Analytical Procedures Index, and the Green Solvent Selection Tool approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene Functionalized Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Fluorescent Photoswitches: Characterization of their Spectral Properties and Application in Imaging of Amyloid Beta Plaques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the synthesis and characterization of two fluorescent norbornadiene (NBD) photoswitches, each incorporating two conjugated pyrene units. Expanding on the limited repertoire of reported photoswitchable fluorescent NBDs, we explore their properties with a focus on applications in bioimaging of amyloid beta (A&#946;) plaques. While the fluorescence emission of the NBD decreases upon photoisomerization, aligning with what has been previously reported, for the first time we observed luminescence after irradiation of the quadricyclane (QC) isomer. We deduce how the observed emission is induced by photoisomerization to the excited state of the parent isomer (NBD) which is then the emitting species. Thorough characterizations including NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence, X&#8208;ray structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems. Notably, one NBD&#8208;QC system exhibits exceptional durability. Additionally, these molecules serve as effective fluorescent stains targeting A&#946; plaques in situ, with observed NBD/QC switching within the plaques. Molecular docking simulations explore NBD interactions with amyloid, unveiling novel binding modes. These insights mark a crucial advancement in the comprehension and design of future photochromic NBDs for bioimaging applications and beyond, emphasizing their potential in studying and addressing protein aggregates</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;formation of fused pentagonal structure on fjord region of polyaromatic hydrocarbons under hydrothermal conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) via Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization in water, focusing on the formation of fused pentagonal rings within heavily fused PAH frameworks. Utilizing platinum catalysts at lower temperatures (200&#8208;260&#176;C) in water, led to the successful synthesis of singly cyclized CP&#8208;PAHs. The reaction conditions facilitated the mono&#8208;cyclization of substrates such as dibenzo[g,p]chrysene and its isomers, yielding the desired products while suppressing the formation of bis&#8208;cyclized compounds. The use of Fe2O3 as an additive in conjunction with PtO2 was effective to suppress hydrogenation of the substrates and products. The products exhibited a redshift in UV&#8208;visible absorption and photoluminescence bands due to a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization for the controlled synthesis of CP&#8208;PAHs, with implications for various applications in materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence and Lifetime Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Polarity Change During Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new form of regulated cell death, ferroptosis is closely related to various diseases. Tracing ferroptosis related biological behavior is helpful to better understand this process and its related biology. Considering that ferroptosis is featured with remarkable lipid peroxidation which can easily change the membranes&#8217; compositions and structures, it is potential to detect intracellular environmental changes for direct assessment of ferroptosis. In view of the close relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ferroptosis, we designed an ER&#8208;targeted and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probe SBD&#8208;CH, which has superior photostability and can respond to polarity with high selectivity without the affection of viscosity. SBD&#8208;CH can monitor the trend of ER polarity during ferroptosis by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and analyze the distribution of polarity in ferroptosis by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). During Erastin induced ferroptosis, the polarity of ER in HT&#8208;1080 cells increased and the polarity distribution in ER was more dispersed. Our work provides an effective strategy for evaluating the process of ferroptosis by monitoring the changes of ER polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fagopyrins from Buckwheat Flowers: Structural and Stereochemical Characterization through Combined NMR/CD Spectroscopy and Theoretical Calculations.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fagopyrins are phenantroperylenequinones present in the flowers of Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) endowed with photodynamic activity. It has been reported that fagopyrin extracts actually contain a complex mixture of closely related compounds, differing only on the nature of the perylenequinone substituents. We report our systematic and detailed study on the chemical composition of fagopyrin extracts by a combination of preparative and analytical techniques. The combined use of 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy was found to be particularly suited to fully characterize all stereochemical aspects of the extracted fagopyrins. For the first time nine isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, thus giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity found in the extract.</dc:description>

MN(SiMe3)2 mediated various functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H latent nucleophiles is summarized in this minireview. These alkali metal chemistries are competitive to the existing methodology, and performs unusual organic transformations, thus opening up new vistas in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Organoalkali compounds have undergone a far&#8208;reaching transformation being a coupling partner to a mediator in unusual organic conversions which finds its spot in the field of sustainable synthesis. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has always been the priority in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization, however alternatively, in recent times this has been seriously challenged by earth&#8208;abundant alkali metals and their complexes arriving at new sustainable organometallic reagents. In this line, the importance of MN(SiMe3)2 (M=Li, Na, K &amp; Cs) reagent revived in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization over recent years in organic synthesis is showcased in this minireview. MN(SiMe3)2 reagent with higher reactivity, enhanced stability, and bespoke cation&#8208;&#960; interaction have shown eye&#8208;opening mediated processes such as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling, radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling, aminobenzylation, annulation, aroylation, and other transformations to utilize readily available petrochemical feedstocks. This article also emphasizes the unusual reactivity of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent in unreactive and robust C&#8722;X (X=O, N, F, C) bond cleavage reactions that occurred alongside the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Overall, this review encourages the community to exploit the untapped potential of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent and also inspires them to take up this subject to even greater heights.

         <title>Naphthalene diimide&#8211;Annulated Heterocyclic Acenes: Synthesis, Electrochemical and Semiconductor Properties and their Multifaceted Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic naphthalene diimide (NDI) acenes and NDI hydroazaacenes possess unique and intriguing properties. This review explores the diverse range of synthetic routes as well as their versatile applications in areas such as sensors, semiconductors, optical and redox&#8211;switchable materials as well as in biology.







Abstract
Acenes and Naphthalene Diimides (NDIs) stand as distinguished classes of organic compounds, each possessing unique and intriguing properties that have garnered significant attention across various scientific disciplines. Acenes, characterized by linearly fused aromatic rings, have captivated researchers due to their diverse electronic structures and promising applications in materials science. On the other hand, NDIs, known for their distinctive electron&#8211;accepting properties, exhibit remarkable versatility in fields ranging from organic electronics, supramolecular to spin chemistry. In this review, we navigate through the fascinating realms of both acenes and NDIs before converging our focus on the highly diverse and distinctive subgroup of NDI&#8211;annulated heterocyclic acenes. This potentially important subgroup, has emerged as a subject of intense investigation, encapsulating their fascinating synthesis, optical and electrochemical characteristics, and multifaceted applications that span the realms of chemistry, physics, and biology. Through the exploration of their synthetic strategies, unique properties, and diverse applications, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the pivotal role played by NDI&#8208;based heterocyclic acenes in contemporary multidisciplinary research and technological innovation.

         <title>Interfacial Bonding Induced Charge Transfer in Two&#8208;Dimensional Amorphous MoO3&#8208;x/Graphdiyne Oxide Non&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructures for Dominant SERS Enhancement</title>

         <dc:description>
2D amorphous non&#8208;van der Waals MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO heterostructures obtained by supercritical CO2 exhibit excellent Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering performance in detecting methylene blue (10&#8722;14&#8197;M) with the enhancement factor of 2.55&#215;1011 due to the interfacial bonding induced charge transfer.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown to be an effective substrate for Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. However, the enhancement factor (EF) tends to be relatively weak compared to that of noble metals and does not allow for trace detection of molecules. In this work, we report the successful preparation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous non&#8208;van der Waals heterostructures MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO nanomaterials using supercritical CO2. Due to the synergistic effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the charge transfer effect, it exhibits excellent SERS performance in the detection of methylene blue (MB) molecules, with a detection limit as low as 10&#8722;14&#8197;M while the enhancement factor (EF) can reach an impressive 2.55&#215;1011. More importantly, the chemical bond bridging at the MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO heterostructures interface can accelerate the electron transfer between the interfaces, and the large number of defective surface structures on the heterostructures surface facilitates the chemisorption of MB molecules. And the charge recombination lifetime can be proved by a ~1.7&#8208;fold increase during their interfacial electron&#8208;transfer process for MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO@MB mixture, achieving highly sensitive SERS detection.

         <title>7Li NMR Spectroscopy: a Tool for Determining Dimerization Constants and Averaged Dimerization Constants of the Monomer/Dimer Equilibrium of Hierarchical Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7Li NMR is a perfect tool for the evaluation of supramolecular aggregates. In case of titanium(IV) based hierarchical helicates dimerization as well as averaged dimerization constants are determined and the expansion and compression of molecular switches is followed. Thus, 7Li NMR helps to understand phenomena far beyond the simple observation of a heteroatom resonance in solution or in the solid.







Abstract
7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool to study hierarchically assembled helicates of the form Li[Li3L6Ti2]. Internally bound and external lithium ions can be well distinguished by solution&#8208; or solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and dimerization constants of the monomer/dimer equilibrium can be easily determined in solution. Averaged dimerization constants can be estimated in case of statistical mixtures of helicates formed from mixtures of ligands.

While coordination of [Ru(cym)] to ubiquitin at Met1 caused a large compaction of the native&#8208;like protein, [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts had negligible effects, as also observed for myoglobin.







Abstract
Modern approaches in metallodrug research focus on compounds that bind protein targets rather than DNA. However, the identification of protein targets and binding sites is challenging. Using intact mass spectrometry and proteomics, we investigated the binding of the antimetastatic agent RAPTA&#8208;C to the model proteins ubiquitin, cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin. Binding to cytochrome c and lysozyme was negligible. However, ubiquitin bound up to three Ru moieties, two of which were localized at Met1 and His68 as [Ru(cym)], and [Ru(cym)] or [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts, respectively. Myoglobin bound up to four [Ru(cym)(PTA)] moieties and five sites were identified at His24, His36, His64, His81/82 and His113. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding (CIU) studies via ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry allowed measuring protein folding as a function of collisional activation. CIU of protein&#8211;RAPTA&#8208;C adducts showed binding of [Ru(cym)] to Met1 caused a significant compaction of ubiquitin, likely from N&#8208;terminal S&#8722;Ru&#8722;N chelation, while binding of [Ru(cym)(PTA)] to His residues of ubiquitin or myoglobin induced a smaller effect. Interestingly, the folded state of ubiquitin formed by His functionalization was more stable than Met1 metalation. The data suggests that selective metalation of amino acids at different positions on the protein impacts the conformation and potentially the biological activity of anticancer compounds.

         <title>Development of Biocompatible Cu(I)&#8208;Microdevices for Bioorthogonal Uncaging and Click Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the development of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I) catalysts and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. Polymeric devices featuring a range of tridentate ligands and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. We also present a preliminary exploration of their use for in&#8197;situ PROTAC synthesis through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed bioorthogonal reactions emerged a decade ago as a novel strategy to implement spatiotemporal control over enzymatic functions and pharmacological interventions. The use of this methodology in experimental therapy is driven by the ambition of improving the tolerability and PK properties of clinically&#8208;used therapeutic agents. The preclinical potential of bioorthogonal catalysis has been validated in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo with the in&#8197;situ generation of a broad range of drugs, including cytotoxic agents, anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and anxiolytics. In this article, we report our investigations towards the preparation of solid&#8208;supported Cu(I)&#8208;microdevices and their application in bioorthogonal uncaging and click reactions. A range of ligand&#8208;functionalized polymeric devices and off&#8208;on Cu(I)&#8208;sensitive sensors were developed and tested under conditions compatible with life. Last, we present a preliminary exploration of their use for the synthesis of PROTACs through CuAAC assembly of two heterofunctional mating units.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Analogues of Wittig Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) analogues of Wittig hydrocarbon, i.&#8201;e. [(NHC)2(Stil)] have been reported as crystalline solids. One&#8208;electron oxidations of [(NHC)2(Stil)] afford radical cations [(NHC)2(Stil)]&#8901;+, which can be further oxidized into the dications [(NHC)2(Stil)]2+.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) analogues of Wittig hydrocarbon, [(NHC)(Stil)(NHC)] (3a&#8208;c) (NHC = SIPr (1a) = C[N(Dipp)CH2]2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr (1b) = C[N(Dipp)CH]2; Me&#8208;IPr (1c) = C[N(Dipp)CMe]2 and Stil = C6H4CHCHC6H4) have been reported as crystalline solids. 3a&#8208;c are prepared by two&#8208;electron reductions of the corresponding bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;imidazoli(ni)um bromides [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)](Br)2 (2a&#8208;c) with KC8 in &gt;94&#8201;% yields. 2a&#8208;c are accessible by the nickel catalyzed direct C&#8722;C coupling of NHCs (1a&#8208;c) with (E)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;dibromostilbene. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3a,b yields the corresponding radical cations [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)]B(C6F5)4 4a,b. All compounds have been characterized by UV&#8208;Vis/NMR/EPR spectroscopy as well as 2a, 3a, and 3b by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of representative systems have been analyzed by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel continuous process is proposed for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetra(ethylene glycol), PEG4&#8208;MCSi, which is a precursor to the useful building block PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate, PEG4&#8208;MCS. The system at the core of this work is a set of cascaded continuously stirred tank reactors (portrayed aesthetically in the illustration) containing the reaction mixtures. The core features of this work are listed. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Pan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304319).

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of ferroelectric molecular crystals is described: the methoxyphenyl acetophenone azines, (MeO&#8722;Ph, Y)&#8208;azines with Y=F (1), Cl (2), Br (3), or I (4). The crystals of 1&#8211;4 not only exhibit the desired polar stacking of beloamphiphile monolayers (PBAMs), but the results exceed expectations. Crystals 1&#8211;4 feature planar biphenyl moieties enhancing PBAM stability and NLO performance. Avoiding interlayer halogen bonding allows perfect polar stacking of PBAMs of fluoroazine 1. Chloroazine 2 presents a unique case of a kryptoracemate due to conformational helicity. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Glaser and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400182).

         <title>Selective B(3)&#8208;H activation without auxiliary reagents affording multinuclear Ir(III) complexes with (o&#8208;carboranyl)dithioester ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method was developed to link two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties to form a series of carboranyl dithioester bridging ligands via in situ substitution of haloalkanes by tetraphenylphosphonium carboranyldithiocarboxylates. Based on these ligands, direct B&#8208;H activation without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was successfully achieved with half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) substrate [Cp*IrCl2]2 to yield corresponding bimetallic or trimetallic complexes. Single crystal structure analyses of the B&#8208;H activated complexes and corresponding SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation in these complexes.</dc:description>

The structural analyses disclose the presence of multivalent Fe centres with different spin states in complex 12+ whereas all the Fe centres share a conserved oxidation state in complex 22+. The DC magnetic study revealed antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent metal centres and ferrimagnetic behaviour in 12+. On the other hand, ferromagnetic interactions were observed in complex 22+ due to nearly orthogonal orientation of the interacting orbitals and poor spatial overlap as observed in BS&#8208;DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>The Application of Porous Organic Polymers as Metal Free Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light photocatalysis is an important tool in organic synthesis, enabling the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates. Current precious metal&#8208;based photocatalysts face limitations like cost and toxicity, fueling the search for alternatives like porous organic polymers (POPs). This review examines POPs&#8217; role as photocatalysts in organic synthesis, discussing representative materials, mechanisms, comparisons with other photocatalysts, and future prospects.







Abstract
Concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on our environment highlight the urgent need for new sustainable technologies. Visible light photocatalysis allows the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. The more widespread adoption of the current generation of photocatalysts, particularly those using precious metals, is hampered by drawbacks such as their cost, toxicity, difficult separation, and limited recyclability. This is driving the search for alternatives, such as porous organic polymers (POPs). This new class of materials is made entirely from organic building blocks, can possess high surface area and stability, and has a controllable composition and functionality. This review focuses on the application of POPs as photocatalysts in organic synthesis. For each reaction type, a representative material is discussed, with special attention to the mechanism of the reaction. Additionally, an overview is given, comparing POPs with other classes of photocatalysts, and critical conclusions and future perspectives are provided on this important field.

         <title>Polymer Supported Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged Symmetrical Binuclear Dioxidomolybdenum(VI) Complexes and Their Homogeneous Analogues as Potential Catalysts for Efficient Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;Cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;Chromenes/Pyrans</title>

Polymer supported heterogeneous as well as homogeneous nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear dioxidomolybdenum(VI) complexes have been synthesised, characterised and used as potential catalysts for the multicomponent one pot synthesis of biologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenes/pyrans.







Abstract
Reaction of 2&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole with known intermediates (i&#8211;iii), prepared from diaminoguanidine hydrochloride with salicylaldehyde, 5&#8208;bromosalicylaldehyde or 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylaldehyde, in the presence of triethylamine (NEt3) led to the formation of benzimidazole appended new ligands, H4L1&#8208;H4L3 (I&#8211;III). The homogeneous nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear complexes, [(MoVIO2)2(L1)(H2O)2] (1), [(MoVIO2)2(L2)(H2O)2] (2) and [(MoVIO2)2(L3)(MeOH)2] (3) have been isolated by reacting these ligands with [MoVIO2(acac)2] in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 molar ratio in refluxing methanol. Using 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand to Mo precursor) molar ratio under above reaction conditions resulted in the corresponding mononuclear complexes, [MoVIO2(H2L1)(MeOH)] (4), [MoVIO2(H2L2)(H2O)] (5) and [MoVIO2(H2L3)(MeOH)] (6). The binuclear heterogeneous compounds [(MoVIO2)2(L1)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;1), [(MoVIO2)2(L2)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;2) and [(MoVIO2)2(L3)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;3) have been obtained by immobilization of 1&#8211;3 onto chloromethylated polystyrene (PS) beads. All synthesized ligands, homogeneous as well as supported compounds have been characterized by elemental analyses and various spectroscopic methods. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study of complexes 1 and 3 confirms their nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear structures while 4 is mononuclear. Heterogeneous compounds (PS&#8208;1&#8208;PS&#8208;3) have further been studied by microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive spectroscopy. These compounds (homogeneous and heterogeneous) were explored for catalytic applications to one&#8208;pot multicomponent reactions (MCRs) for efficient synthesis of biologically active 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenes/pyrans (21 examples). Optimising various reaction parameters helped in achieving as high as 97&#8201;% yields of products. Though, only half equivalent of the binuclear complexes (1&#8208;3) was required compared to mononuclear analogues (4&#8208;6) to achieve comparable yields, heterogeneous catalysts have an added advantage due to their stability and recyclability. Suitable reaction mechanism has also been proposed based on isolated intermediates.

         <title>Perfect Polar Alignment of Parallel Beloamphiphile Layers: Improved Structural Design Bias Realized in Ferroelectric Crystals of the Novel &#8220;Methoxyphenyl Series of Acetophenone Azines&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Azines are fundamentally different in that their helicity is a function of the N&#8722;N bond conformation and chirality results in the absence of chiral centers.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202400182).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Harmeet Bhoday, Nathan Knotts, and Rainer Glaser at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Joe Miner, the university mascot, is a silent and honorary co&#8208;author and personifies the spirit of the old west and the determination to succeed (our emphasis).

         <title>Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Crystalline Iodinated Eumelanin Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of eumelanin monomer by halogenation leading to triplet state population via intersystem crossing (ISC), along with the observance of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the crystalline iodinated eumelanin monomer.







Abstract
We report the room temperature phosphorescence upon iodination on a crystalline eumelanin monomer with shielded hydroxyl moieties, ethyl 5,6&#8208;dimethoxyindole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (DMICE). Ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) is observed in the iodinated (IDMICE) as well as brominated (BDMICE) analogues of the eumelanin monomer derivative in solution. The triplet quantum yields (&#966;T) and intersystem crossing rates (kISC) of the halogenated eumelanin derivatives are 
=25.4&#177;1.1&#8201;%; 
=1.95&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 
=59.1&#177;1.6&#8201;%; 
1.36&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, as monitored using transient absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations based on nuclear ensemble method reveal that computed kISC and spin&#8208;orbit coupling matrix elements for eumelanin derivatives are larger for IDMICE relative to BDMICE. The halogen and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with distinct excitonic coupling and higher ISC rate promote phosphorescence in IDMICE molecular crystals. Accessing triplet excited states and resultant photoluminescence through structural modification of eumelanin scaffolds paves way for exploring the versatility of eumelanin&#8208;inspired molecules as bio&#8208;functional materials.

         <title>Achieving Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes via Molecule Anchoring and lon&#8208;Transport pumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valine was introduced as an aqueous electrolyte additive. The functional groups within the additive molecules were utilized to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI), thereby achieving a reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode.







Abstract
The potential for scale&#8208;up application has been acknowledged by researchers for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Nonetheless, the progress of the development is significantly impeded due to the instability of the interface between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Herein, efficient and environmentally benign valine (Val) were introduced as aqueous electrolyte additive to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) via functional groups in additive molecules, thus achieving reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. The amino groups present in Val molecules have a strong ability to adsorb on the surface of zinc metal, enabling the construction of anchored molecular layer on the surface of zinc anodes. The strongly polar carboxyl groups in Val molecules can act as ion&#8208;transport pumps to capture zinc ions in the electric double layer (EDL) through coordination chemistry. Therefore, this reconstructed EEI could modulate the zinc ion flux and simultaneously suppress side reactions and dendritic growth of Zn. Consequently, a long stable cycling up to 1400&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. Additionally, Zn//V2O5 full cell with Val additive exhibit enhanced cyclability, retaining 77&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles, displaying significant potential in promoting the commercialization of ZIBs.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Structural, Optical and Magnetic Modifications in Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensibility of lanthanide coordination complexes to the crystal field strength makes them ideal candidates for switching Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behavior and piezochromic effect under applied high pressure. A complementary structure&#8208;property relationship is established with the combination of high pressure magnetometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction allowing to explain the observed structural, optical and magnetic modifications.







Abstract
Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets are fascinating objects that break magnetic performance records with observable magnetic bistability at the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen, paving the way for potential applications in high&#8208;density data storage. The switching of lanthanide SMM has been successfully achieved using several external stimuli such as redox reaction, pH titration, light irradiation or solvation/desolvation thanks to the high sensitivity of the magnetic anisotropy to any structural change in the lanthanide surrounding. Nevertheless, the use of applied high pressure as an external stimulus is largely underused, especially considering that it can be combined with high pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction to establish a complementary structure&#8208;property relationship. This Concept article summarizes the few relevant examples of investigations of lanthanide SMMs under applied high pressure, provides conclusions on the effect of such stimulus on molecular structures and magnetic anisotropy, and finally draws perspective on the future development of magnetic measurements under applied pressure.

         <title>Predisposition in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Assembly of Tetrahedral Boronate Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Latent intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) within the building blocks play a crucial role in the assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs) via Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). These intramolecular interactions emerge from induced conformational restrictions during cage assembly, ultimately dictating the reaction outcome in a relay&#8208;like fashion.







Abstract
Directional bonding strategies guide the design of complex molecular architectures, yet challenges arise due to emergent behavior. Rigid structures face geometric constraints and sensitivity to mismatches, hindering the efficient assembly of molecular organic cages (MOCs). Harnessing intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions offers a promising solution, broadening geometrical possibilities and enhancing adaptability to boost assembly yields. However, identifying these interactions remains challenging, with their full potential sometimes latent until final assembly. This study explores these challenges by synthesizing boronic acid tripods with varied oxygen positions at the tripodal feet and investigating their role in assembling tetrahedral boronate MOCs. Our results reveal substantial differences in the assembly efficiency among tripods. While the building blocks with oxygen in the benzylic position relative to the central aromatic ring form the MOCs in high yields, those with the oxygen atom directly bound to the central aromatic ring, only yield traces. Through X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT analyses, we elucidate how intramolecular interactions profoundly influence the geometry of the building blocks and cages in a relay&#8208;like fashion, highlighting the importance of considering intramolecular interactions in the rational design of (supra)molecular architectures.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidation of Polycyclic Aromatic Amines Towards Carbazoles and Phenazine&#8208;based Aza&#8208;helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical study revealed that high activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region of the free radical hybrid determine the regioselectivity of polycyclic aromatic amines (PAAs) electrochemical oxidation towards carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicenes. This work would pave the way for precise construction of heteroatom fused helical large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using direct splicing strategy from PAHs derivatives.







Abstract
Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;&#8208;conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary&#8208;, ternary&#8208;, and quaternary&#8208;fused PAAs as electro&#8208;oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K&#8208;region, Bay&#8208;region, and L&#8208;region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron&#8208;deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro&#8208;oxidative reaction of PAA.

&lt;p&gt;Experimental and theoretical study revealed that high activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) region of the free radical hybrid determine the regioselectivity of polycyclic aromatic amines (PAAs) electrochemical oxidation towards carbazole and phenazine based aza-helicenes.

&lt;p&gt;Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;-conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary-, ternary-, and quaternary-fused PAAs as electro-oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza-helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K-region, Bay-region, and L-region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron-deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro-oxidative reaction of PAA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Driving Triplet State Population in Benzothioxanthene Imide Dyes: Let's twist!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle chemical modification in the bay area of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) was used to shed light on the closely intertwined connections between spin&#8208;orbit coupling, distortion of the &#960;&#8208;system, and intersystem crossing.







Abstract
Controlling the formation of photoexcited triplet states is critical for many (photo)chemical and physical applications. Here, we demonstrate that a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) dye promotes intersystem crossing by increasing spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This manipulation was achieved through a subtle chemical modification, specifically the bay&#8208;area methylation. Consequently, this simple yet efficient approach expands the catalog of known molecular engineering strategies for synthesizing heavy atom&#8208;free, dual redox&#8208;active, yet still emissive and synthetically accessible photosensitizers.

         <title>The Utilization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives Composite in Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation methods and electrochemical applications of MOFs and their derivatives composite materials in the field of supercapacitors are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and prospects of MOFs in supercapacitor are discussed.







Abstract
Up to now, the mainstream adoption of renewable energy has brought about substantial transformations in the electricity and energy sector. This shift has garnered considerable attention within the scientific community. Supercapacitors, known for their exceptional performance metrics like good charge/discharge capability, strong power density, as well as extended cycle longevity, have gained widespread traction across various sectors, including transportation and aviation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique traits including adaptable structure, highly customizable synthetic methods, and high specific surface area, have emerged as strong candidates for electrode materials. For enhancing the performance, MOFs are commonly compounded with other conducting materials to increase capacitance. This paper provides a detailed analysis of various common preparation strategies and characteristics of MOFs. It summarizes the recent application of MOFs and their derivatives as supercapacitor electrodes alongside other carbon materials, metal compounds, and conductive polymers. Additionally, the challenges encountered by MOFs in the realm of supercapacitor applications are thoroughly discussed. Compared to previous reviews, the content of this paper is more comprehensive, offering readers a deeper understanding of the diverse applications of MOFs. Furthermore, it provides valuable suggestions and guidance for future progress and development in the field of MOFs.

         <title>Enhancing Intramolecular Ferromagnetic Coupling in Tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Based Compounds through Spin Polarization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) J&#8208;coupling between spin&#8208;polarized&#8208;donor radicals like Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF+&#8901;) and Nitronyl&#8208;Nitroxide (NN) connected by a coupler, such as in BTBN, is a key ingredient to achieve magnetoresistant response. In silico modifications of BTBN accomplish the enhancement of the FM coupling by using hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene as coupler, while preserving BTBN&#8242;s structure, providing promising candidates for a (possibly) improved magnetoresistance material.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized donor radicals based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives and nitronyl nitroxide (NN) radicals in which one&#8208;electron oxidation involves the HOMO instead of the SOMO are well known for exhibiting magnetoresistance. In particular, BTBN consists of one dibromo&#8208;TTF and one NN radical, which are linked by a phenyl coupler group. One of the key factors driving magnetoresistance is the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the oxidized &#960;&#8208;donor (TTF+&#8901;, D unit) and NN (R unit). Here, a theoretical study is carried out to assess suitable candidates with enhanced FM coupling with respect BTBN, which is thus used as a reference. The study is conducted via in silico chemical modification of the substituents of the BTBN basic functional units (D and R radicals, C coupler) to benefit from the spin polarization mechanism to boost the intramolecular FM coupling, aiming to distort the BTBN radical arrangement within the molecular crystal as little as possible, in the event the material can be synthesized. NICSiso(1) and Wiberg's Bond Order are analyzed to further assist in identifying promising potential candidates, since the decrease in aromaticity is expected to enhance the diradical character and give rise to a larger magnetic coupling value. The most favorable diradical building block to replace the BTBN moiety results from using a hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene (&#8722;(H)C=C(OH)&#8722;) as a coupler preserving BTBN original radicals, namely, NN and TTF+&#8901; units. This study aims at illustrating the feasibility of improving the intramolecular FM interaction between radical moieties, which is fully realized, as a first step towards the synthesis of new materials with (possibly) enhanced magnetoresistance properties.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction to NH3 by Enhancing N2 Activation via Interaction between Au Nanoparticles and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;101(Fe) with a large specific surface area has a strong N2 adsorption capacity, which promotes the enrichment of N2 on the surface of the catalyst, and the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the activation of N2, thereby effectively promoting the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction.

Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted much attention as a sustainable ammonia production technology, but it needs further exploration due to its slow kinetics and the existence of competitive side reactions. In this research, xAu/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) catalysts were obtained by loading gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto MIL&#8208;101(Fe) using a one&#8208;step reduction strategy. Herein, MIL&#8208;101(Fe), with high specific surface area and strong N2 adsorption capacity, is used as a support to disperse Au NPs to increase the electrochemical active surface area. Au NPs, with a high NRR activity, is introduced as the active site to promote charge transfer and intermediate formation rates. More importantly, the strong interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) enhances the electron transfer between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe), thereby enhancing the activation of N2 and achieving efficient NRR. Among the prepared catalysts, 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) has the highest NH3 yield of 46.37&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 39.38&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V (vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ FTIR reveals that the NRR mechanism of 15&#8201;%Au/MIL&#8208;101(Fe) follows the binding alternating pathway and also indicates that the interaction between Au NPs and MIL&#8208;101(Fe) strengthens the activation of the N&#8801;N bond in the rate&#8208;limiting process, thereby accelerating the NRR process.

         <title>Fingerprints of Chalcogen Bonding Revealed Through 77Se&#8208;NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oriented chemical shift tensor can reveal anisotropy in the electron density around a reporter nucleus. Here we measure the 77Se chemical shift tensor in a single crystal, which shows significant anisotropy due to participation of the selenium in a chalcogen bond. This technique suggests the presence of a potential second chalcogen bond site, which has not previously been observed in this system.







Abstract
77Se&#8208;NMR is used to characterise several chalcogen bonded complexes of derivatives of the organoselenium drug ebselen, exploring a range of electron demand. NMR titration experiments support the intuitive understanding that chalcogen bond donors bearing more electron withdrawing substituents give rise stronger chalcogen bonds. The chemical shift of the selenium nucleus is also shown to move upfield as it participates in a chalcogen bond. Solid&#8208;state NMR is used to explore chalcogen bonding in co&#8208;crystals. Due to the lack of molecular reorientation on the NMR timescale in the solid state, the shape of the chemical shift tensor can be determined using this technique. A range of co&#8208;crystals are shown to have extremely large chemical shift anisotropy, which suggests a strongly anisotropic electron density distribution around the selenium atom. A single crystal NMR experiment was conducted using one of the co&#8208;crystals, affording the absolute orientation of the chemical shift tensor within the crystal. This showed that the selenium nucleus is strongly shielded in the direction of the chalcogen bond (due to the approach of the lone pair of the Lewis base), and strongly deshielded in the perpendicular direction. The orientation of the deshielded axis is consistent with the presence of a second &#963;&#8208;hole which is not participating in a chalcogen bond, showing the profound effect of electron density anisotropy on the chemical shift.

         <title>Chiral Spiro&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalenes: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties, Conformational Issues and Charge Transfer Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;TTFs have been characterized experimentally and theoretically, and the formation of charge transfer complexes with TCNQF2 and TCNQF4 has been reported. The chiroptical investigation of the neutral systems revealed significant differences in chiroptical activity depending on the nature of chiral centres and between diastereomers.







Abstract
Within this work we have investigated spiro&#8208;based tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) obtained as mixtures of stereoisomers from racemic spiro[5.5]undeca&#8208;1,8&#8208;dien&#8208;3&#8208;one. Compared to previously described spiro&#8208;TTFs, enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric forms have been here separated by chiral HPLC and fully characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The two types of spiro&#8208;based chiral derivatives contain either one (2) or three (1) chiral centres out of each one is spiro&#8208;type. Experimental CD, supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations, shows differences in the optical activity between the 1 and 2 and their intermediates. The low optical activity of 2 and 3 (spiro alone chirality) was attributed to the presence of two conformers in the solution (ax and eq) of opposite Cotton effect whereas in the case of 1 and 5 (spiro and stereogenic centres) the spiro chirality seems to be responsible of the Cotton effect in the high energy region whereas the R and S chirality in the low energy region. Racemic and enantiopure forms have been successfully used for the synthesis of charge transfer complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) based acceptors.

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculation predict double and single M&#246;bius aromaticity in the global minimum geometries of Rh2B2 and RhB2&#8722; clusters. Heavier analogue Ir2B2 follows the same type of aromaticity, albeit being non&#8208;planar. Aromaticity of these clusters have been confirmed by various analysis.







Abstract
Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n&#8197;electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8722; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Oriented Asymmetric Catalysis: Conformational Modulation of Transition State Multivalency during a Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Assembly of a Pharmaceutically Relevant Atropisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Albeit of significative recent pharmaceutical interest, there is an almost complete absence of asymmetric methods to deliver enantioenriched, axially chiral N&#8208;aryl quinazolinediones. Posed with the challenge of establishing such a catalytic method, we developed a new class of superbasic bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts. In addition, we carried out extensive computational modeling to dissect the role of the individual elements in governing the catalyst's activity and selectivity.







Abstract
A new class of superbasic, bifunctional peptidyl guanidine catalysts is presented, which enables the organocatalytic, atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral quinazolinediones. Computational modeling unveiled the conformational modulation of the catalyst by a novel phenyl urea N&#8208;cap, that preorganizes the structure into the active, folded state. A previously unanticipated noncovalent interaction involving a difluoroacetamide acting as a hybrid mono&#8208; or bidentate hydrogen bond donor emerged as a decisive control element inducing atroposelectivity. These discoveries spurred from a scaffold&#8208;oriented project inspired from a fascinating investigational BTK inhibitor featuring two stable chiral axes and relies on a mechanistic framework that was foreign to the extant lexicon of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Utilizing Immobilized Molecular Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present &#8216;Concept&#8217; provides a comprehensive review of recent strides in continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, employing a packed&#8208;bed reactor featuring immobilized palladium complexes. Emphasis is placed on meticulously designed catalyst structures and the innovative reaction technologies employed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, accentuating their pivotal roles in the establishment of a pragmatic synthesis process.







Abstract
Immobilized Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using a packed&#8208;bed reactor, representing an efficient, automated, practical, and safe technology compared to conventional batch&#8208;type reactions. The core objective of this study is the development of an active and durable catalyst. In contrast to supported Pd nanoparticles, the attachment of Pd complexes onto solid supports through well&#8208;defined coordination sites is considered a favorable approach for preparing highly dispersed and stabilized Pd species. These species can be directly employed in various flow reactions without the need for pre&#8208;treatment. This concept paper explores recent achievements involving the application of immobilized Pd complexes as precatalysts for continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. Our focus is to elucidate the significance of the designed catalyst structures in relation to their catalytic performance under flow conditions. Additionally, we highlight various reaction systems and catalyst packing methods, emphasizing their crucial roles in establishing a practical synthesis process.

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. Antimicrobial peptides are found to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates, leading to clustering or even to the formation of fibrillar structures. Such morphological transformations are expected to impair the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly.







Abstract
Recently, the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as excellent candidates for overcoming antibiotic resistance has attracted significant attention. AMPs are short peptides active against bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. It has been shown that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. These biocondensates are crucial for viral replication as they concentrate the viral RNA with the host cell&#8216;s protein machinery required for viral protein expression. Thus, N&#8722;P biocondensates are promising targets to block or slow down viral RNA transcription and consequently virion assembly. We investigated the ability of three AMPs to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates. Using microscopy techniques, supported by biophysical characterization, we found that the AMP LL&#8211;III partitions into the condensate, leading to clustering. Instead, the AMP CrACP1 partitions into the droplets without affecting their morphology but reducing their dynamics. Conversely, GKY20 leads to the formation of fibrillar structures after partitioning. It can be expected that such morphological transformation severely impairs the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly. These results could pave the way for the development of a new class of AMP&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting biocondensates.
