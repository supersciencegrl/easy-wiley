         <title>DFT mechanistic investigation on manganese pincer complex catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper the density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to investigate the cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate catalyzed by Mn&#8208;PNN pincer complex. The whole reaction process mainly includes three stages: the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the coupling of benzaldehyde with methanol to hemiacetal and the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal to methyl benzoate. The calculated results indicated that two dehydrogenation processes are influenced by two competitive mechanisms of inner and outer spheres. Dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is the rate&#8208;determining step of the whole reaction, with the energy barrier of 22.1 kcal/mol. In addition, the regeneration of catalyst is also extremely important. Compared with direct dehydrogenation, the dehydrogenation mode assisted by formic acid is more advantageous. This work might provide theoretical insights and shed light on the design of cheap transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Sequential Catalytic Arylation&#8211;Fukuyama Cross&#8208;coupling of 1,1&#8208;Biszincioalkane Linchpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,1&#8208;Bis(iodozincio)alkanes are used as dinucleophilic linchpins in an enantioselective double cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence involving aryl iodides and then thioesters. The two catalytic C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reactions are achieved in the same pot through two distinct palladium&#8208;based catalytic systems: a first non&#8208;enantioselective one delivering configurationally labile secondary benzylzinc species from an achiral precursor, and a second enantioconvergent one that operates a highly efficient dynamic kinetic resolution of the racemic intermediates. This strategy, new in the area of asymmetric synthesis through two consecutive electrophilic substitution reactions of geminated C(sp3)&#8208;organodimetallics, provides useful methodology to access in a modular fashion acyclic a&#8208;disubstituted ketone products with very high enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization and Automation of Helical Aromatic Oligoamide Foldamer Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helically folded oligoamides of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid composed of up to 41 units were prepared using optimized manual solid phase synthesis (SPS). The high yield and purity of the final products places these SPS protocols among the most efficient known to date. Furthermore, analytical methods allowing for the clear identification and purity assessment of the products were validated, including 1H NMR, a seldom used method for such large molecules. Adaption of the SPS protocols, in particular using in situ acid chloride activation under Appel&#8217;s conditions, made it possible to efficiently implement SPS on a commercial peptide synthesizer, leading to a dramatic reduction of the laboratory work required to produce long sequences. Automation constitutes a breakthrough for the development of helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the reactivity of diazaborinines towards the activation of &#963;&#8208;bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poorly understood factors governing the small molecule activation reactions mediated by diazaborinines have been computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the activation of E&#8208;H &#963;&#8208;bonds (E = H, C, Si, N, P, O, S) has been investigated. These reactions, which proceed in a concerted manner, are exergonic and, in general, associated with relatively low activation barriers.In addition, the barrier becomes lower for the E&#8208;H bonds involving the heavier element in the same group (&#916;G&#8800;: C&gt;Si; N&gt;P; O&gt;S). This reactivity trend together with the mode of action of the diazaborinine system are quantitatively analyzed by means of the activation strain model of reactivity in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Hybrid Composed of Anisotropic Niobate Layers Modified with MoC Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hybrid composed of anisotropic niobate layers modified with MoC nanoparticles is synthesized by multistep reactions. The stepwise interlayer reactions for layered hexaniobate induce selective surface modification at the alternate interlayers and the following ultrasonication leads to the formation of double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The further liquid phase MoC deposition with the double layered nanosheets leads to the decoration of MoC nanoparticles on the surfaces of the double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The new hybrid can be regarded as a stacking of the two layers with anisotropically modified nanoparticles. The relatively high temperature in the MoC synthesis causes partial leaching of the grafted phosphonate groups, and the exposed surface of the niobate nanosheets due to the partial leaching may interact with MoC to succeed the hybridization. The hybrid after heating exhibits photocatalytic activity, indicating that this hybridization method can be useful for hybrid synthesis of semiconductor nanosheets and co&#8208;catalyst nanoparticles toward photocatalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Tetrathiafulvalene and Nickel&#8722;Bis(dithiolene) Units into Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Stable and Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) are typical conductive units widely studied in electronics, optics, and photochemistry. However, their applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion are often limited by insufficient NIR absorption and low chemical/thermal stability. Herein, we integrate TTF and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) into a covalent organic framework (COF) with stable and efficient NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance. Two isostructural COFs, namely Ni&#8208;TTF and TTF&#8208;TTF, are successfully isolated which are composed of TTF and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) units as donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) pairs or TTF units only. Both COFs show high BET surface areas and good chemical/thermal stability. Notably, compared with TTF&#8208;TTF, the periodic D&#8208;A arrangement in Ni&#8208;TTF significantly lowers the bandgap, leading to unprecedented NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanol&#8208;Supported Lanthanide Complexes for Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence at 1550 nm.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) at 1550 nm is reported from lanthanide complexes supported by Vanol; these are the first examples of coordination of Vanol to lanthanides. A change in the ligand design from a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (in Binol) to a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol (in Vanol) results in significantly improved dissymmetry factors for (Vanol)3ErNa3 (|glum| = 0.64) at 1550 nm. This is the highest reported dissymmetry factor to date in the telecom C&#8208;band region, and among the highest for any lanthanide complexes. Comparative solid&#8208;state structural analysis of (Vanol)3ErNa3 and (Binol)3ErNa3 suggests that a less distorted geometry around the metal center is in part responsible for the high chiroptical metrics of (Vanol)3ErNa3. This phenomenon was further evidenced in the analogous ytterbium complexes (Vanol)3YbNa3 that also exhibit significantly improved dissymmetry factors (|glum| = 0.21). This confirms and generalizes the same observation that was made in other visibly emitting, six&#8208;coordinate lanthanide complexes. Due to their strong CPL at 1550 nm, the reported complexes are potential candidates for applications in quantum communication technologies. More importantly, our structure&#8208;CPL activity relationship study provides guidance towards the generation of even better near infrared&#8208;CPL emitters.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) at 1550 nm is reported from lanthanide complexes supported by Vanol; these are the first examples of coordination of Vanol to lanthanides.

         <dc:description>A series of self&#8208;assembling gluconamide conjugated naphthalimide amphiphiles (GCNA) was synthesized and the self&#8208;assembly of GCNA into gel rendered an increased electron density in naphthalimide moiety with overall change in energy of 15.33x10&#8208;32 J via J&#8208;type aggregation. SEM analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction underpinning the nanofibrillar formation, and rheology confirmed the processablity and material fabrication. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA4 via cooperative intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions makes it as effective electron donor in the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The TENG based on GCNA4&#8208;polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) triboelectric pair generated an output voltage, current and power density of ~250 V, 40 &#956;A and ~622 mW/m2 respectively, which is almost 2.4 times better in performance than the amorphous GCNA4 based TENG.

         <title>Direct C&#8208;H Arylation of Dithiophene&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene: Tuneable Electronic Properties and 2D Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Networks at the Solid/Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiafulvalene is among the most well&#8208;known building blocks in molecular electronics due to its outstanding electron&#8208;donating and redox properties. Among its derivatives, dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) has attracted considerable interest in organic electronics, owing to its high field&#8208;effect mobility. Herein, we report the direct C&#8208;H arylation of DT&#8208;TTF to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups in order to evaluate their influence on the electronic properties by cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Self&#8208;assembly of the DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface. The tetrabenzoic acid derivative can attain a planar geometry on the graphite surface due to van der Waals interactions with the surface and H&#8208;bonding with neighbouring molecules. This study demonstrates a simple method for the synthesis of arylated DT&#8208;TTF derivatives for the construction of novel p&#8208;extended electroactive frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Co2+ Doped Biotinylated Carbon Dot: A Theranostic Agent for Target Specific Killing of Cancer Cells via Hypoxia Induced Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional cancer treatments have systematic side effects that stand against its desirable therapeutic efficacy. Alternative strategies using biochemical features of cancer cells to promote apoptosis are finding notable significance. One such important biochemical feature of malignant cells is hypoxia, alteration of which can lead to cell death. Hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF&#8208;1a) has the key role in hypoxia generation. Herein, we synthesized biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) that specifically diagnose and selectively killed cancer cells with 3&#8208;3.1&#8208;fold higher efficiency over non&#8208;cancer cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay in CoCDb treated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells confirmed the increased expression of HIF&#8208;1a that was responsible for efficient killing of cancer cells. In 2D cells and 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis that make CoCDb a potential theranostic agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Linkage Chemistry to Interlayer Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing methodology: Emerging strategies, such as linkage transformation strategy, bond protection strategy, and interlayer interaction engineering, have recently been developed to regulate the stability of 2D imine&#8208;linked COFs. This provides a facile solution to the instability of imine&#8208;linked COFs while simultaneously conserving their structural crystallinity and functionality.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (imine&#8208;COFs) represent the most sought&#8208;after class of COFs due to their broad monomer scope and ease of synthesis. Owing to the reversible nature of imine linkages, however, the chemical stability of most imine&#8208;COFs is still far from adequate. In this context, emerging strategies, ranging from linkage chemistry to interlayer interaction, have been employed to construct stable imine&#8208;COFs for their applications in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. This Concept article summarizes the latest advances aimed at tuning the structural stability of imine&#8208;COFs. Furthermore, this Concept provides a prospective for the precise design of stable imine&#8208;COFs based on the characteristics of structure, physical properties, and chemical functions, as well as the mechanism of structure locking and stabilization during crystal growth.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Oxidation by a Tungsten Dependent Aldehyde Oxidoreductase from Aromatoleum Aromaticum</title>

A bacterial W&#8208;dependent enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase catalyses the oxidation of a broad range of aldehyde to their carboxylic acids driven by electrochemistry at low applied potentials.







Abstract
In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes operate at significantly lower redox potentials, and in some cases they can carry out reversible redox transformations of their substrates and products. Still, the electrochemical properties of W enzymes have received much less attention than their Mo relatives. Herein we analyse the tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) from the mesophilic bacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum which has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode. This generates a functional system that electrochemically oxidises a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two&#8208;electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient catalytic process.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes operate at significantly lower redox potentials, and in some cases they can carry out reversible redox transformations of their substrates and products. Still, the electrochemical properties of W enzymes have received much less attention than their Mo relatives. Herein we analyse the tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) from the mesophilic bacterium &lt;i&gt;Aromatoleum aromaticum&lt;/i&gt; which has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode. This generates a functional system that electrochemically oxidises a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two-electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient catalytic process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. Ultrafast 2D NMR experiments acquired in&#8208;line yield useful quantitative information in just 40&#8197;s.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. The reaction mixture exiting the flow reactor is flown through the NMR spectrometer and directly analyzed. In the case of simple substrates, suitable information can be obtained through 1D 1H spectra, but for molecules of higher complexity the use of 2D experiments is key to address signal overlaps and assignment issues. Here we show the usefulness of ultrafast 2D COSY experiments acquired in 70&#8197;s or less, for the in&#8208;line monitoring of photochemical reactions, and the possibility to obtain reliable quantitative information. This is a powerful framework to, for example, efficiently screen reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the chemistry of perfluoroalkylindium compounds is rather unexplored, here, we report on the syntheses and full characterization of a variety of salts featuring the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate anion, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;. The reaction of InCl3 with LiC2F5 selectively yields [Li(thf)n][In(C2F5)4], which is used as starting material for the syntheses of various [In(C2F5)4]&#8722; salts.







Abstract
In the rising field of organoindium chemistry little is known about the perfluoroorganyl&#8208;substituted indium compounds. The increasing use of indium reagents is explained by their high stability and tolerance towards water and functional groups. Here we report on the synthesis of the novel tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;, and its characterization in salts with the cations [Li(thf)3]+, Cs+, [PPh4]+ and [H14O6]2+ (thf=tetrahydrofuran). To the best of our knowledge, these salts constitute the first perfluoroalkylindates and, in general, the first isolated perfluoroalkylindium compounds which are fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>A Simple Four&#8208;Step Synthesis of the Potato Alkaloid Demissidine from the Common Sapogenin Tigogenin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;step synthesis of demissidine from tigogenin acetate was developed. The key&#8208;step of the synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate.







Abstract
A simple synthesis method of solanidane alkaloids from common steroidal sapogenins was developed. Previously described multi&#8208;step transformations of tigogenin to demissidine (8&#8211;12&#8197;steps) were shortened to four steps only. The key&#8208;step of the present synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate. Different approaches to this reaction, i.&#8201;e., a classical one via enolate, and a chemoselective umpolung transformation, were thoroughly investigated. The epimerization step is unnecessary if the starting sapogenin has the same configuration at C25 as the target alkaloid because the configuration at C25 (either R or S) remains intact throughout the synthesis. Thus, the related solanidane alkaloids, 12&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;25&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine and 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine, were synthesized in the three&#8208;step procedure with retention of configuration at this stereogenic center from rockogenin (25R&#8208;5&#945;&#8208;sapogenin) or sarsasapogenin (25S&#8208;5&#946;&#8208;sapogenin), respectively.

         <title>[ReH3(PPh3)4] &#8211; A Key Compound in the Rhenium Hydride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>

A key to rhenium hydride chemistry: The preparation of crystalline [ReH3(PPh3)4] allows for the preparation of defined rhenium(III) polyhydrido complexes through ligand exchange procedures with more basic phosphines. Azavinylidene complexes of the type [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] are the final products of reactions with nitriles. Potential proton or hydride donors react with [ReH3(PPh3)4] in toluene to give the pentahydride [ReH5(PPh3)3].







Abstract
The chemistry of the rhenium trihydrido complex [ReH3(PPh3)4] (1) has been reinvestigated. An improved synthesis and the solid&#8208;state structure of the compound as well as several reactions are reported. The solid&#8208;state structure of 1 is similar to that of [TcH3(PPh3)4] having a capped&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere. The PPh3 ligands surround the Re atom in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal mode with a short apical Re&#8722;P bond (2.300(2)&#8197;&#197;) and three longer basal bonds (2.429(2)&#8211;2.449(2)&#8197;&#197;). Reactions of 1 with monodentate phosphines such as PMe3 or PBu3 give the mono&#8208;substituted complexes [ReH3(PPh3)3(PMe3)] (2) and [ReH3(PPh3)3(PBu3)] (3) under retention of the apical PPh3 ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh3 ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh3&gt;PMe3&gt;PBu3. Treatment of [ReH3(PPh3)4] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH4(NCCH3)(PPh3)3]+ (4), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] (5). They are formed by an insertion of the nitrile into a Re&#8722;H bond. The solid&#8208;state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)CH3)] (5&#8201;a) was determined showing a linear Re&#8722;N&#8722;C unit with rhenium&#8722;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8722;carbon double bonds, while the N=CH&#8722;C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;. Two previously unknown polymorphs of [ReH5(PPh3)3] were isolated from reactions of 1 with HOC6H3(CH3)2 and thiourea after prolonged heating in toluene and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Reactions of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with monodentate phosphines such as PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or PBu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; give the mono-substituted complexes [ReH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and [ReH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PBu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) under retention of the apical PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;PBu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Treatment of [ReH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NCCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NC(H)R)] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). They are formed by an insertion of the nitrile into a Re&#8722;H bond. The solid-state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NC(H)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) was determined showing a linear Re&#8722;N&#8722;C unit with rhenium&#8722;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8722;carbon double bonds, while the N=CH&#8722;C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;.

         <title>Electrochemical and Structural Characterization of Soft Landed Tungsten&#8208;Substituted Lindqvist Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion soft&#8208;landing enables accurate characterization of compound features using high&#8208;quality separation power. Using a quadrupole mass filter, ions are mass&#8208;selected and deposited onto a surface maintaining structural integrity. Doped and undoped polyoxovandates synthesized using solvothermal conditions are accurately characterized using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry.







Abstract
Lindqvist polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten&#8208;substituted POV&#8208;alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms. Soft landing of mass&#8208;selected ions was used to purify heterometal POV&#8208;alkoxides that cannot be readily separated using conventional approaches. The soft landed POV&#8208;alkoxides are characterized using infrared reflection&#8208;absorption spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The redox properties of the isolated ions are examined using an in&#8197;situ electrochemical cell which enables traditional in vacuo electrochemical measurements inside of an ion soft landing instrument. Although the overall cluster core retains redox activity after tungsten doping, vanadium&#8208;based redox couples (VV/VIV) are shifted substantially, indicating a pronounced effect of a heteroatom on the electronic structure of the core.

         <title>An Innovative Bi12SiO20 Multistage Cubic Nanospheres Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Bi//Zn Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 architecture is prepared by a simple calcination method and used as a cathode for high&#8208;performance Bi//Zn battery. The battery fabricated by the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20 cathode and Zn foil anode shows superior energy density (247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling durability (100&#8201;% capacity retention after 5000 cycles).







Abstract
Alkaline Bi//Zn batteries with superb safety, low cost, and high power density are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. However, their developments are severely limited by the Bi&#8208;based cathode as the unsatisfying capacity and cycle life. Herein, an innovative multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 (MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20) is successfully synthesized by a simple calcination method, which shows excellent energy storage performances of superior specific capacity (294&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate capability (134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 12&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). When coupled with Zn anode a superior MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 375&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Additionally, the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn battery shows excellent cycle life, which reserves more than 100&#8201;% of its original capacity after 5000 cycles. Such performance is higher than previously reported Bi//Zn battery and most other Zn batteries. This is the first example of using Bi12SiO20 as cathode for RAZBs, which may provide highly promising material towards better Bi//Zn battery.

         <title>Green Synthesis and Analytical Characterization of Core&#8208;Shell Copper Sub&#8208;Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green procedure for the preparation of Cu particles is here described, exploiting the stabilizing efficacy of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to obtain Cu@PVP core&#8208;shell particles. A simple washing and immobilization protocol allows modifying a polymer matrix without altering its physicochemical properties. Composite thin films show a controlled ionic release with promising antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
This study demonstrates a simple and reproducible approach to synthesize green core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles stabilized by poly(n&#8208;vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Cu@PVP colloids were here prepared using copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor and glucose as reducing agent. The presence of PVP in the synthetic medium eliminates the need for an inert atmosphere during the process, thus simplifying the whole method. Both the morphology and the spectroscopic properties of Cu@PVP colloids were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and infrared, UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Size distributions and average shell thickness were obtained by statistical analysis on TEM micrographs, and spectroscopies demonstrated the formation of a PVP layer around the copper core. The produced colloids were employed in composite thin films for potential antimicrobial application, in association with a highly&#8208;recyclable polymer: polycarbonate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;(1&#8208;methylethylidene)bis(phenol)).

         <title>Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid&#8208;State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transport in a series of thymine&#8208;thymine mismatched DNA hairpins is fine&#8208;tuned. Surprisingly, the solid&#8208;state charge transport enhancement exhibits a semi&#8208;quantitative linear relationship with the integrity changes of DNA base pair stacking, which is modulated by the Hg ion chelation and DNA sequence. Such a deep mechanistic understanding will guide the design of future DNA&#8208;based electronics and bio/chemical sensors.







Abstract
Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid&#8208;state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill&#8208;defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive&#8208;linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid&#8208;state current&#8208;voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion&#8208;induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B&#8208;form.

     alt="Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid-State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The charge transport in a series of thymine-thymine mismatched DNA hairpins&lt;/b&gt; is fine-tuned. Surprisingly, the solid-state charge transport enhancement exhibits a semi-quantitative linear relationship with the integrity changes of DNA base pair stacking, which is modulated by the Hg ion chelation and DNA sequence. Such a deep mechanistic understanding will guide the design of future DNA-based electronics and bio/chemical sensors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid-state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill-defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well-defined self-assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive-linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid-state current-voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion-induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B-form.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of Nitrous Oxide by Light Alcohols Catalysed by a Low&#8208;Valent Ruthenium Diazadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low valent diruthenium dihydride complex catalyses the reduction of nitrous oxide with primary alcohols or hydrogen. Light alcohols (methanol, ethanol) or benzylic alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O.The reaction proceeds under mild conditions achieving TON of up to 480 and TOF of 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Decomposition of the environmentally harmful gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is usually performed thermally or catalytically. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is currently the most promising technology for N2O mitigation, a multicomponent heterogeneous catalytic system that employs reducing agents such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or a combination thereof. This study reports the first homogenous catalyst that performs the reduction of nitrous oxide employing readily available and cheap light alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol derivatives. During the reaction, these alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O, later entering the reaction as substrate. The reaction is catalysed by the low&#8208;valent dinuclear ruthenium complex [Ru2H(&#956;&#8208;H)(Me2dad)(dbcot)2] that carries a diazabutadiene, Me2dad, and two rigid dienes, dbcot, as ligands. The reduction of nitrous oxide proceeds with low catalyst loadings under relatively mild conditions (65&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, 1.4&#8197;bar N2O) achieving turnover numbers of up to 480 and turnover frequencies of up to 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Gold Teflates Revisited: From the Lewis Superacid [Au(OTeF5)3] to the Anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route to the gold(III) pentafluoroorthotellurates [Au(OTeF5)3] and [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; based on commercially available gold chlorides is presented. The former was classified as a Lewis superacid, with an enhanced Lewis acidity yet better manageability compared to AuF3, underlining the potential of the &#8722;OTeF5 group to also stabilize highly reactive transition&#8208;metal compounds.







Abstract
A new synthetic access to the Lewis acid [Au(OTeF5)3] and the preparation of the related, unprecedented anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; with inorganic or organic cations starting from commercially available and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle gold chlorides are presented. In this first extensive study of the Lewis acidity of a transition&#8208;metal teflate complex by using different experimental and quantum chemical methods, [Au(OTeF5)3] was classified as a Lewis superacid. The solid&#8208;state structure of the triphenylphosphine oxide adduct [Au(OPPh3)(OTeF5)3] was determined, representing the first structural characterization of an adduct of this highly reactive [Au(OTeF5)3]. Therein, the coordination environment around the gold center slightly deviates from the typical square planar geometry. The [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; anion shows a similar coordination motif.

Abstract
Thia&#8208;Michael additions (1,4&#8208;additions of a thiol to a Michael acceptor) are generally catalyzed by an external Br&#248;nsted or Lewis base. A spontaneous (uncatalyzed) Michael addition of thiols to &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acrylates is described, as well as its application to the very efficient preparation of a thermoset. A thorough mechanistic investigation, based on an experimental kinetic study and on DFT calculations, is presented for the addition of arene&#8208; and alkanethiols to tert&#8208;butyl trifluoromethyl acrylate in polar aprotic solvents, unveiling a probable solvent&#8208;assisted proton transfer in the rate&#8208;determining step and a considerable lowering of the energy barrier induced by the CF3 group.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity Switch During Alkene Reductions: Diastereodivergent Syntheses of Molecular Fossils via MHAT or Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a diastereoselective and robust strategy we prepared a set of 16 molecular fossils (MF) and confirmed the presence of 6 of them in a 120&#8208;million&#8208;year&#8208;old geological sample. Unlike structural fossils, MF came from soft tissues, and during their (dia)catagenesis they suffer framework and stereochemical modifications exposing their geological history. Such changes and concentration differences helped us to prove an ancient oil migration event.







Abstract
Sixteen geosterane derivatives were synthesized in up to 57&#8201;% overall yields in four steps harnessing the olefin cross&#8208;metathesis (OCM) and Metal hydride H atom transfer (MHAT) or homogeneous hydrogenation reactions as key steps. Drawing on this strategy, the diastereomeric ratio (d.&#8201;r.) reached up to 24&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the thermodynamic isomer and 7&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the other isomer in the hydrogenation step. In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2&#8208;(3&#945;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan) acetate, methyl 2&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate, and methyl 6&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)hexanoate, as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120&#8197;million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those carboxylic acids derived from forerunner geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.

In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2-(3&#945;-5&#945;H-cholestan) acetate, methyl 2-(3&#946;-5&#945;H-cholestan)acetate, and methyl 6-(3&#946;-5&#945;H-cholestan)hexanoate, as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120&#8197;million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those carboxylic acids derived from forerunner geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mediated Mechanoredox Borylation and Arylation Reactions by Ball Milling</title>

Upon mechanical agitation, piezoelectric metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to promote mechanoredox reactions, enabling both borylation and arylation reactions between aryl diazonium salts and bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes with high efficiencies.







Abstract
Herein, metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were synthesized, and their piezoelectric properties were characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy. Under mechanical agitation, the highly polarized UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to reduce aryl diazonium salts, forming the aryl radical species, which further react with bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes to generate the desired products with broad substrate scope. For all substrates, it was found that the reactions mediated by UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which exhibited better piezoelectric property, were more efficient than those promoted by UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, it was shown that the convenient regeneration of spent catalysts can be reused for promoting mechanoredox reactions without loss of activities by taking advantage of the unmatched repairability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical pathway was involved in these transformations.

Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives with cyclic ketimines attached to a neutral functional group is reported. This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities. Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the 5&#8208;aminopyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones was performed, with no decrease in the yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Tuning Directed Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Conversion of Pyrrole&#8208;Based Styryl Coumarin Dual&#8208;Color Photoconverters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning photoconverter: We have studied the effects of N&#8208;substitution of styryl coumarin pyrrole dyes on their photophysical and photoconversion properties. This study led to an improved version of a dual&#8208;emission photoconverter based on the directed photooxidation&#8208;induced conversion mechanism, which was successfully used in bioimaging with sequential photoconversion of single cells.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;emissive photoconvertible fluorophores (DPCFs) are powerful tools to unambiguously track labeled cells in bioimaging. We recently introduced a new rational mechanism called directed photooxidation&#8208;induced conversion (DPIC) enabling efficient DPCFs to be obtained by conjugating a coumarin to aromatic singlet&#8208;oxygen reactive moieties (ASORMs). Pyrrole was found to be a suitable ASORM as it provided a high hypsochromic shift along with a fast and efficient conversion. By synthesizing various pyrrole&#8208;based styryl coumarin dyes, we showed that the photoconversion properties, including the quantum yield of photoconversion and the chemical yield of conversion can be tuned by chemical modification of the pyrrole. These modifications led to an improved dual emissive converter, SCP&#8722;Boc, which displayed a high brightness and an enhanced photoconversion yield of 63&#8201;%. SCP&#8722;Boc was successfully used to sequentially photoconvert cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

Development of epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. The best inhibitor irreversibly inactivates the &#946;5 subunit of the P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome and contains a hexanoyl group at P4, a D&#8208;amino acid at P3 and a fluorinated aromatic L&#8208;amino acid at P1. This compound represents a novel, potent and selective antimalarial drug lead.







Abstract
Here, we present remarkable epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000&#8208;fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic&#8208;stage P.&#8197;falciparum over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D&#8208;amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from P.&#8197;falciparum cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171&#8208;fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a P. berghei mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6&#8197;days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti&#8208;malarial drugs.

         <title>The Prominence of Facilitator&#160;&#960;&#8208;Holes: The Classic N&#8592;N Pnictogen Bonding in Nitrobenzene&#8208;Ammonia Dimer with its Structural Elucidation and Experimental Characterization at Low Temperatures</title>

A direct correlation between the magnitude of potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen in &#8208;NO2 moiety and the strength of the pnictogen bond hosted by nitrogen is obtained by infrared spectroscopy of matrix isolated heterodimers of nitromethane and nitrobenzene with ammonia. The pivotal role of &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen as a facilitator of pnictogen bonds is demonstrated.







Abstract
The nitrogen of nitro group is a paradigmatic pnictogen due the presence of a&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole and a number of studies have been performed recently on prototypical nitromethane (NM). Homodimers and heterodimers of NM are sustained by&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bonds hosted by nitrogen. To understand the effect of substitution on this &#960;&#8208;hole and thus the pnictogen bond, heterodimers of nitrobenzene (NB; phenyl substitution in place of methyl) with ammonia (AM) have been probed, as a test case, using matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and&#160;ab initio&#160;computations. Of the four structures optimized on the potential energy surface the energetically dominant global minimum, stabilized by &#960;&#8208;hole driven O=N&#8592;N pnictogen bonding with co&#8208;operative N&#8722;H&#8592;O hydrogen bonding, was experimentally identified at low temperatures. A comparison of the pnictogen bonding of NB&#8208;AM dimers with NM counterpart (NM&#8208;AM dimers) divulged the dominance of electrostatic origin of pnictogen bonding in both the class of dimers. The reduced strength of pnictogen bonding in NB&#8208;AM dimers in comparison to NM&#8208;AM dimers was discerned, which has been established to be a consequence of the reduced electrostatic potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole of NB relative to that in NM. The strength of&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bond was directly correlated with the binding energy and the infrared shifts in the signature vibrational bands of the NB, NM and AM submolecules due to dimerization under matrix isolated conditions at low temperatures.

         <title>A Widely Applicable and Versatile Method for the Ring&#8208;Opening 1,3&#8208;Carbocarbonation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>

1,3&#8208;Carbocarbonation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) was achieved by employing Grignard reagents under copper catalysis, followed by the addition of carbon electrophiles. This method allowed the installation of both saturated and unsaturated carbon residues at both the electrophilic and nucleophilic sites.







Abstract
A 1,3&#8208;carbocarbonation of 2&#8208;substituted cyclopropane 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates introduces various saturated or unsaturated carbon residues at the 1&#8208; and 3&#8208; position of the former three&#8208;membered ring. Under copper catalysis, ring&#8208;opening attack with a Grignard reagent proceeded smoothly; the intermediate was converted to the final product by reaction with appropriate carbon&#8208;based electrophiles under basic conditions. As nucleophiles, Grignard reagents derived from sp3&#8208;, sp2&#8208;, and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon residues were successfully employed, whereas various aliphatic bromides and EBX derivatives (for sp moieties) served as electrophiles.

With the increase of x, the liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x changed from lamellar structure to columnar structure. The polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric effect, with 25&#8197;mA current under UV irradiation.







Abstract
A series of side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x, where x is the molar ratio of cyanostilbene (CN&#8208;DBE) to poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) repeating unit, was synthesized based on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between P4VP and CN&#8208;DBE. Their luminescent property, liquid crystalline structure and photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property were elucidated using photoluminescence spectra, X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal imaging and thermoelectric experiments. With the increase of x, the supramolecular system can be changed from lamellar structure to hexagonal columnar structure. Moreover, the P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photothermal effect. The temperature of P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)0.6 can rise to 130&#8201;&#176;C within 10&#8197;s under the irradiation of ultraviolet lamp. In addition, the supramolecular system possesses unique photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric conversion ability, and 25&#8197;mA current can be detected in the circuit coupled with the thermoelectric module. This work broadens the potential applications of hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer, and provides a simple and facile strategy to prepare liquid crystalline polymers with photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property.

The reduction of {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5&#8197;equivalents of KC8 generates the cyclic tetra&#8208;tin tetra&#8208;boryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion. This system is non&#8208;aromatic as determined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift Calculations, with the principal resonance structures shown to involve a Sn=Sn double bond and 1,2&#8208;localized negative charges.







Abstract
The reduction of the boryl&#8208;substituted SnII bromide {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5&#8197;equivalents of potassium graphite leads to the generation of the cyclic tetratin tetraboryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion. This system is non&#8208;aromatic as determined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift Calculations (NICS(0)=&#8722;0.28, NICS(1)=&#8722;3.17), with the primary contributing resonance structures shown by Natural Resonance Theory (NRT) to involve a Sn=Sn double bond and 1,2&#8208;localized negative charges. Abstraction of the K+ cations or oxidation leads to contraction or cleavage of the Sn4 unit, respectively, while protonation generates the neutral dihydride 1,2&#8208;Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4H2 (a heavier homologue of cyclobutene) in a manner consistent with the predicted charge distribution in the [Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4]2&#8722; dianion.

         <title>An Aluminium Imide as a Transfer Agent for the [NR]2&#8722; Function via Metathesis Chemistry</title>

Reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with oxygen&#8208;containing substrates are probed with a view to developing its use as a transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8722; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] fragments to give organo&#8208;azide, &#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;imine products, driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with a range of oxygen&#8208;containing substrates have been probed with a view to developing its use as a novel main group transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8722; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] units driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation. N2O reacts rapidly to generate the organoazide DippN3 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), while CO2 (under dilute reaction conditions) yields the corresponding isocyanate, DippNCO. Mechanistic studies, using both experimental and quantum chemical techniques, identify a carbamate complex K2[(NON)Al&#8208;{&#954;2&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;N(Dipp)CO2}]2 (formed via [2+2] cycloaddition) as an intermediate in the formation of DippNCO, and also in an alternative reaction leading to the generation of the amino&#8722;dicarboxylate complex K2[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8722;(O,O&#8242;)&#8722;(O2C)2N&#8208;(Dipp)}] (via the take&#8208;up of a second equivalent of CO2). In the case of benzaldehyde, a similar [2+2] cycloaddition process generates the metallacyclic hemi&#8208;aminal complex, Kn[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;(N(Dipp)C(Ph)(H)O}]n. Extrusion of the imine, PhC(H)NDipp, via cyclo&#8208;reversion is disfavoured thermally, due to the high energy of the putative aluminium oxide co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(O)]2. However, addition of CO2 allows the imine to be released, driven by the formation of the thermodynamically more stable aluminium carbonate co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(&#954;2&#8722;(O,O&#8242;)&#8722;CO3)]2.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Ir(III) dihydride complex catalyzed 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols was realized, affording the corresponding less easily accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively in high yields from readily available starting materials. The reaction pathway involves a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and the dihydride in Ir(III) dihydride complex acts as the hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of iridium center.







Abstract
The allylic alcohol structural motif is prevalent in many important molecules and valuable building blocks. The rearrangement reaction is one of the most important transformations, however there are only a few reports for the 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols. Herein, a 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols catalyzed by an Ir(III) dihydride complex is described. This reaction could provide the corresponding less accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively from readily available E/Z mixtures of the substrates. Furthermore, a tandem alkene isomerization followed by 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of homoallylic alcohols was also realized. In addition, this rearrangement reaction could be used to synthesize the natural product Navenone B. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the reaction pathway involved a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and that the dihydride in the iridium catalyst acts as a hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of the iridium center.

         <title>Balancing Attraction and Repulsion: The Influence of London Dispersion in [10]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Fullerene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular assembly between substituted [10]cycloparaphenylene (s[10]CPP) and fullerenes was studied to investigate the subtle interplay of steric repulsion, conformation and attractive London dispersion interactions. For this, [10]CPP and a tert&#8208;butyl ester&#8208;substituted analogue were employed as host molecules whose fluorescence is quenched upon addition of C60 as well as alkyl malonyl ester&#8208;substituted fullerenes.







Abstract
Herein we present a systematic study of the influence of different alkyl chains in malonyl ester fullerene adducts with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP]) and a tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) ester&#8208;substituted [10]CPP analogue. The association constants between the nanoring hosts and the fullerene guests were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments. The trends in association were rationalized by an interplay of repulsion arising from an extended volume and London dispersion as an attractive counterpart.

Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to reactions that can proceed in biological systems without interfering with biological processes. It has enabled the study of biomolecules in their native environment and has facilitated advanced imaging and diagnostic applications. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203942), M.&#8197;M.&#8197;A. Mitry, F. Greco and H.&#8197;M.&#8197;I. Osborn critically appraise the suitability of bioorthogonal reactions for in vivo applications. Areas of focus are chemical reactions and the targeting mechanisms used to deliver the bioorthogonal reactions&#8217; components.

Molecular interactions are a combination of different attractive and repulsive forces. We have studied the delicate balance within a supramolecular [10]cycloparaphenylene&#8211;fullerene complex&#8212;both functionalized with alkyl esters&#8212;to evaluate the attractive and repulsive interplay between the substituents on the components. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A. Wegner and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300268).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 can be converted into hydrocarbon fuel through renewable electricity. This review introduces three strategies that can effectively combine CO2 reduction with organic conversion. Through the selection of substrates and the design of catalysts, the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;N bonds can be precisely controlled, which can expand the product range and use renewable power more effectively.

Coupling CO2 reduction and organic conversion can create a win&#8208;win situation, and this can not only obtain high&#8208;value chemicals with high selectivity, but also reduce reaction overpotential and improve energy efficiency. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of different coupling systems, and propose opinions for further development of this direction.







Abstract
The electrochemical process of coupling electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and organic conversion reaction can effectively reduce the reaction overpotential and obtain value&#8208;added chemicals. Moreover, because of the diversity of substrates and the designability of coupling forms, more and more attention has been paid to this field. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of coupling electrolysis in recent years, (1) co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and organics at the cathode to obtain specific products with high selectivity, (2) replacing traditional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other valuable oxidation reactions to improve energy utilization efficiency and economic benefits of CO2 conversion, (3) in an electrolytic cell without membrane, the cathode and anode jointly transform CO2 and organics to redox products. We hope that the examples and insights on coupling electrolysis introduced in this review can inspire researchers to further explore and innovate in this direction.

         <title>In Vivo Applications of Bioorthogonal Reactions: Chemistry and Targeting Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry in the in vivo settings. In this review, we discuss the latest trends in the in vivo applications of bioorthogonal reactions. The advances in bioorthogonal reactions that are considered for in&#8197;vivo applications, and the targeting methods used to deliver the biorthogonal components to the desired site of action, are discussed along with the pretargeting approach for radiolabelling.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry involves selective biocompatible reactions between functional groups that are not normally present in biology. It has been used to probe biomolecules in living systems, and has advanced biomedical strategies such as diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, the challenges and opportunities encountered when translating in vitro bioorthogonal approaches to in vivo settings are presented, with a focus on methods to deliver the bioorthogonal reaction components. These methods include&#8197;metabolic bioengineering, active targeting, passive targeting, and simultaneously used strategies. The suitability of bioorthogonal ligation reactions and bond cleavage reactions for in vivo applications is critically appraised, and practical considerations such as the optimum scheduling regimen in pretargeting approaches are discussed. Finally, we present our own perspectives for this area and identify what, in our view, are the key challenges that must be overcome to maximise the impact of these approaches.

In this review, the challenges and opportunities encountered when translating &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; bioorthogonal approaches to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; settings are presented, with a focus on methods to deliver the bioorthogonal reaction components. These methods include&#8197;metabolic bioengineering, active targeting, passive targeting, and simultaneously used strategies. The suitability of bioorthogonal ligation reactions and bond cleavage reactions for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; applications is critically appraised, and practical considerations such as the optimum scheduling regimen in pretargeting approaches are discussed. Finally, we present our own perspectives for this area and identify what, in our view, are the key challenges that must be overcome to maximise the impact of these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free Engineering toward Efficient Zinc Storage: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free engineering strategies in each assembly components are summarized to homogenize Zn2+ diffusion and electric field at the Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based energy storage has lately gained popularity due to natural abundance, operational safety, high energy density. Unfortunately, dendrite growth is a common and intractable issue faced in existing zinc&#8208;ion batteries to shorten cycle lifespan/stability. This review summarizes recent progress in assembly component (e.&#8201;g., anode, electrolyte, separator) engineering for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;ion batteries. First, diversiform strategies of Zn surface modification and Zn host design are presented to shield the fundamental adverse effect aroused by uneven zinc deposition on the anode. Then, subtle deployments of electrolyte constituents are illustrated to optimize the Zn2+ solvation structure for ultimate dendrite control and Coulombic efficiency elevation in aqueous systems and beyond (e.&#8201;g., eutectic electrolytes). Furthermore, rational manipulation of advanced separators and the upgrade of zinc metal&#8208;free Zn2+&#8208;storage devices are briefly discussed to explore the dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;storage. Finally, challenges and perspectives are proposed to offer research inspirations toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.

         <title>CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures: importance of dual binding site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 adsorption and activation on Cu single atom catalysts and Cu nanoclusters supported on the (110) surface of rutile and on the (101) surface of anatase TiO2 has been investigated by means of first principles electronic structure calculations. The role of oxide reduction associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies has been considered. Five main messages emerge from this study. (1) CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures is surface sensitive, as the rutile and anatase surfaces can exhibit different behaviours; (2) the surface morphology is essential since CO2 is activated only when the molecule can simultaneously bind to at least two active sites, such as a Cu atom on one side and an oxide ion on the other site; (3) Cu atoms on TiO2 are in +I oxidation state and can bind and activate CO2 via charge transfer from the oxide; (4) on supported Cu clusters CO2 activation occurs mostly at the metal/oxide interface; (5) the presence of O vacancy sites facilitates the spontaneous dissociation of CO2 to CO, or increases the electron density of the metal catalyst, two effects that can influence the mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol or other chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Anionic Ligands on Photoreactivity in Mo(VI) Dioxo Complexes of the Form MoO2X2(NN)
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study into the light&#8208;initiated C&#8722;H activation reactivity by MoO2X2(bpy) elucidates the critical role of a bpy&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. With stronger donating anionic ancillary ligands, the first excited state involves a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer from the anionic ancillary ligand (X), which initiated radical decomposition instead of C&#8722;H activation via the metal oxo motif.







Abstract
The photoreactivity of d0 metal dioxo complexes in activating C&#8722;H bonds has been recently studied.[1&#8211;3] We have previously reported that MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) is an effective platform for light initiated C&#8722;H activation with unique product selectivity for the overall functionalization.[1] Herein we expand on these studies and report the synthesis and photoreactivity of several new Mo(VI) dioxo complexes with the general formula MoO2(X)2(NN); where X=F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, CH3&#8722;, PhO&#8722;, tBuO&#8722; and NN=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;tBu). Among these compounds, MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) and MoO2Br2(bpy&#8208;tBu) are able to participate in bimolecular photoreactivity with several substrates containing C&#8722;H bonds of various types such as allyls, benzyls, aldehydes (RCHO) and alkanes. MoO2(CH3)2bpy and MoO2(PhO)2bpy do not participate in bimolecular photoreactions and instead they undergo photodecompositions. Computational studies indicate that the nature of the HOMO and LUMO is critical in supporting photoreactivity, with access to an LMCT (bpy&#8594;Mo) being necessary for tractable hydrocarbon functionalization.

         <title>Reactivity of Silylene with Gallium&#8208; and Boron Trihalide at Reductive Conditions Resulting in Unforeseen Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galliumhalosilanes: Synthesis of a first compound comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms. Where one gallium presents between two silylene and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. The oxidation state of the gallium and silicon atoms remains the same even after the reduction. Further reaction of silylene with boron halide leads to the formation of silylene&#8208;boron adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot reaction of gallium and boron halides with potassium graphite in the presence of benzamidinate stabilized silylene LSi&#8208;R, (L=PhC(NtBu)2). The reaction of LSiCl with an equivalent amount of GaI3 in the presence of KC8 leads to the direct substitution of one chloride group by gallium diiodide simultaneously additional coordination of silylene resulted in L(Cl)Si&#8594;GaI2&#8208;Si(L)&#8594;GaI3 (1). In compound 1, the structure comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms where one gallium presents between two silylenes and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. In this Lewis acid&#8208;base reaction the oxidation states of the starting materials remain unchanged. The same is valid in the silylene boron adduct formation of L(tBu)Si&#8208;BPhCl2 (2) and L(tBu)Si&#8208;BBr3 (3). This new route provides access to galliumhalosilanes challenging to synthesize by any other method.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Decorated Nonaromatic Amine Emitters Towards Efficient Triplet Exciton Utilization in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possessed powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, sulfur atom is particularly attractive for boosting triplet exciton utilization in electroluminescence. Here, the sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine compounds served as thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emitters for highly efficient OLED applications are highlighted.







Abstract
Purely organic compounds served as promising materials for organic electronics have intrigued extensive research focuses owing to their unique photophysical and electronic properties. In the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the utilization of triplet excitons is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance devices. In contrast to the traditional aromatic amine&#8208;based counterparts, sulfur atom with a high&#8208;level outer orbit simultaneously provides powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and striking spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect to facilitate the utilization of theoretically spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons, demonstrating great prospect in constructing highly emissive purely organic emitters for OLED applications. Herein, we summarize the currently developed sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine&#8208;based emitters exhibiting attractive photoelectronic characteristics, and gain insight into the understanding of molecular design and photophysical processes of these emitters, providing new perspectives for enriching the existing luminescent material systems and designing high&#8208;performance emitters.

         <title>Metal Complex Molecular Junctions as Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular junctions, which are composed of metal electrode&#8208;molecule&#8208;metal electrode structures, are attractive components of thermoelectric devices. In this Concept article, we discuss recent thermoelectric studies on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential utility of functional metal complex junctions for thermoelectric devices is also described.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule junctions and self&#8208;assembled monolayer junctions are attractive architectures for thermoelectric devices. However, given the poor thermoelectric performance of organic molecules investigated so far, molecules characterized by high conductance and Seebeck coefficient values are desired to be explored. Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8208;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.

         <title>Significant Control on Zero&#8208;Field Quantum Tunneling of Magnetization in Dysprosium Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets via Orientation of the Anilato Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bridging ligand orientation in a dinuclear Dy(III) complex provides different coordination geometry. The geometry with higher axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) around DyIII centre gives higher energy barrier (Ueff) than the low order symmetric geometry [triangular dodecahedron geometry (pseudo D2d)] due to the large difference in their transverse anisotropy.







Abstract
Tuning the bridging fashion of anilato ligand in dinuclear DyIII complexes, reveals a sizable effect on the slow relaxation of magnetization. Combined experimental and theoretical studies divulge that the geometry with high order axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) reduces the transverse crystal fields corresponding to QTM (quantum tunneling of magnetization) resulting in a significant increase in energy barrier (Ueff=518&#8197;cm&#8722;1) through the Orbach relaxation process whereas the geometry with lower symmetry (triangular dodecahedron, pseudo D2d) enhances the transverse crystal fields that accelerate the ground state QTM process.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bridging ligand orientation&lt;/b&gt; in a dinuclear Dy(III) complex provides different coordination geometry. The geometry with higher axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) around Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centre gives higher energy barrier (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) than the low order symmetric geometry [triangular dodecahedron geometry (pseudo &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt;)] due to the large difference in their transverse anisotropy.

         <title>Differently N&#8208;Capped Analogues of Fmoc&#8208;FF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues were collected and analyzed in their morphological, mechanical, and functional features, highlighting the effects caused by the Fmoc&#8208; modification.







Abstract
Short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been recently envisioned as excellent building blocks for the formulation of hydrogels with appealing properties. Due to its simplicity and capability to gel under physiological conditions, Fmoc&#8208;FF (N&#945;&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;diphenylalanine), remains one of the most studied low molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators. Since its first identification in 2006, a plethora of its analogues were synthetized and investigated for the fabrication of novel supramolecular materials. Here we report a description of the Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues in which the aromatic Fmoc group is replaced with other substituents. These analogues are distinguished into five different classes including derivatives: i) customized with solid phase peptide synthesis protecting groups; ii) containing non&#8208;aromatic groups, iii) containing aromatic groups, iv) derivatized with metal complexes and v) containing stimuli&#8208;responsive groups. The morphological, mechanical, and functional effects caused by this modification on the resulting material are also pointed out.

         <title>Sparkling Organic Phosphorescence from Fluorinated Tetrathia[7]helicenes: Synthesis and Photophysical, Electrochemical and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putting a green spin on [7]TH: Fluorination of the tetrathia[7]helicene backbone disclosed important functionalization&#8208;related structure&#8208;electronic alterations crucial in the design of novel chiral derivatives. [7]THs also show brilliant green phosphorescence resulting from enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) due to an S&#8208;atom effect and distortion annulation.







Abstract
Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial beacuse most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine&#8208;containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes, highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared in high yields through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550&#8197;nm, and the studies suggest an efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet nonplanar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements, while DFT calculations enable a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations to be defined.

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform mechanochemical method for the partial reduction of TiO2 and Nb2O5 to the corresponding black oxides using NaH and LiH as reducing agents was developed. As shown by EPR spectroscopy, unpaired electrons were generated, and the obtained oxides exhibit better photocatalytic activity than the pristine oxides.







Abstract
Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. This study reports the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ into the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.

         <title>A Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8722;H Olefination Strategy and Its Application Towards Global Proteome Profiling of &#916;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that empowers activity&#8208;based proteome profiling of &#916;8&#8208;THC, a psychoactive natural product from Cannabis sativa, through a late&#8208;stage arene olefination method is described. This olefination method is capable of converting non&#8208;covalent acting compounds, such as &#916;8&#8208;THC, into activity&#8208;based probes after silyl deprotection. Its ability to interrogate protein interaction landscape of &#916;8&#8208;THC is then compared with AfBPP.







Abstract
Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such reliance on innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture restricted its applications to covalent acting compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8722;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H olefination with an arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#916;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4&#8201;db, a &#916;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with AfBP 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#916;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8722;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the synthesis, characterization and basic physiochemical properties of two novel heteroatom&#8208;doped PAHs (BTF and BTT). The studies on their singlet fission (SF) show that the efficiency of BTT is higher than that of BTF by two times while the triplet generation time of BTT becomes slower compared with BTF, indicating that the introduction of sulfur atom has a significant influence on the SF process.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8211;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2&#8197;times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.

Our approach relies on the highly enantioselective syn&#8208;specific Shi&#8208;epoxidation of both olefin isomers and a stereoconverging epoxide hydrosilylation featuring a directional isomerization step via a configurationally labile radical intermediate that is reduced by a syn&#8208;selective intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer from a Ti&#8211;H bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarity and Dielectric Property Control Triggered by a Coordinated Solvent Molecule Exchange in Luminescent Mononuclear Aluminium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of molecule&#8208;based multifunctional switchable materials, exhibiting a switch of polarity and dielectric property, are extremely limited. Herein, we demonstrated solvent&#8208;vapour&#8208;induced reversible molecular rearrangements between non&#8208;polar crystals [Al(sap)(acac)(sol)] (H2sap = 2&#8208;salicylideneaminophenol, acac = acetylacetonate, sol = MeOH (1), EtOH (2)) and polar crystal [Al(sap)(acac)(DMSO)] (3). This crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal structural transformation was accompanied by a switch of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric properties, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, reflecting the SHG&#8208;active polar Cc space group of 3. This is the first reported example of dielectric properties and polarity switching in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit the strong green emission in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Sidechain&#8208;Backbone Tetrel Bonding Interactions Provide a General Mechanism for trans&#8208;Peptoid Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amide bonds impedes de novo design of folded peptoids (poly&#8208;N&#8208;substituted glycines) with precise secondary structures and affects peptoid&#8208;biomolecule binding affinity. Herein, from X&#8208;ray, NMR and DFT studies of azapeptoids, we have discovered a tetrel bonding interaction that stabilizes trans&#8208;peptoids. We show that peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain adopt trans&#8208;amide geometries due to the presence of a nX/&#960;Ar &#8594; &#963;*C&#945;&#8210;N tetrel bonding interaction between the sidechain &#945;&#8208;heteroatom lone pair (nX) or &#960;&#8208;electrons (&#960;Ar) and the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8210;N bond. Further, CD spectroscopic studies of oligo&#8208;proline host&#8208;guest model peptides showed that azapeptoid residues stabilize polyproline II helical conformation. These data indicate that the sidechain&#8208;backbone tetrel bonding could be leveraged to design peptoids with precise secondary structures for a wide range of biological and material applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyst C70 was introduced for the facile construction of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines under mild conditions, yielding a diverse library of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Low catalyst loading, gram scale synthesis, and broad substrate scope (48 examples) demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol and encourage its future application as a photoredox catalyst in organic transformations.







Abstract
Herein, fullerene (C70) is introduced as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#934;&#9653;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical by energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism. The superoxide radical acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process. Azomethine ylide further participates in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Modifications of acyl carrier protein&#8208;bound glycosylated polyketides in pactamycin biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol&#8208;containing natural product produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum. Recent studies showed that the aminocyclopentitol unit is derived from N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine, which is attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound polyketide by a glycosyltransferase enzyme, PtmJ. Here, we report a series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications of the sugar moiety of the glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. In vitro reconstitution of PtmS (an AMP&#8208;ligase), PtmI (an ACP), PtmJ, PtmN (an oxidoreductase), PtmA (an aminotransferase), and PtmB (a putative carbamoyltransferase) showed that the N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine moiety of the glycosylated polyketide is first oxidized by PtmN and then transaminated by PtmA to give ACP&#8208;bound 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl polyketide. The amino group is then coupled with carbamoyl phosphate by PtmB to give a urea functionality.

Recent studies showed that the aminocyclopentitol unit is derived from N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which is attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound polyketide by a glycosyltransferase enzyme, PtmJ. Here, we report a series of post-glycosylation modifications of the sugar moiety of the glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. In vitro reconstitution of PtmS (an AMP-ligase), PtmI (an ACP), PtmJ, PtmN (an oxidoreductase), PtmA (an aminotransferase), and PtmB (a putative carbamoyltransferase) showed that the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine moiety of the glycosylated polyketide is first oxidized by PtmN and then transaminated by PtmA to give ACP-bound 3-amino-3-deoxy-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl polyketide. The amino group is then coupled with carbamoyl phosphate by PtmB to give a urea functionality. We also show that PtmG is a deacetylase that hydrolyses the C-2 N-acetyl group to give a free amine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Yellow Arsenic towards Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbenes (CAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were reacted with yellow arsenic. Several products [(CAAC&#8208;n)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;As2)] (n = 1 (1), 4 (2)), [(CAAC&#8208;2)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;As4)] (3) and [(CAAC3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208; As8)] (6) were isolated due to the differing steric properties of CAAC&#8208;1&#8208;4. The products contain As2, As4 or As8 units and represent the first examples of CAACs&#8208;substituted products of yellow arsenic. The reactivity of As4 was compared with the reactivities of P4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, which led to a series of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives such as ([(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;P4)] (4) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8)] (7)) and the [(CAAC3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;AsP3)] (5). The products were characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods and DFT computations were performed to clarify their formation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Esterase specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Esterases enzymes regulate the body&#8217;s homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase's active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe,&#160;PM&#8208;OAc,&#160;to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH~ 8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM&#8208;OAc)&#160;binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image&#8208;based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Heterobiaryls through Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral heterobiaryls have wide applications in chiral ligands, catalysts, and bioactive compounds, which have aroused great interest in the chemistry community. This review provides a summary of the recent atroposelective synthesis strategies of heterobiaryls via ring&#8208;formation approaches involving transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which have aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic heterobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarize the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through ring formation approaches, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also discussed.

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin (FePEG5kTPP) formed an 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with a face&#8208;to&#8208;face cyclodextrin dimer in aqueous solution. The O2 adduct of the ferrous complex shows similar O2 binding affinity with natural hemoglobin and a long circulation time in blood, leading to the simple supramolecular complex that can be used as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur is described. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is much greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.

         <title>Fine Tuning of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts for the Synthesis of Tropane Alkaloid Skeletons
</title>

         <dc:description>
CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell quantum dots proved to be efficient photocatalysts for a two steps [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons, whereas InP&#8208;ZnS quantum dots stopped after the first step, affording a clean allylation reaction.







Abstract
Several types of Quantum Dots (QDs) (CdS, CdSe and InP, as well as core&#8208;shell QDs such as type I InP&#8208;ZnS, quasi type&#8208;II CdSe&#8208;CdS and inverted type&#8208;I CdS&#8208;CdSe) were considered for generating &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl free radicals. The feasibility of the oxidation of the N&#8208;aryl amines and the generation of the desired radical was evidenced experimentally by quenching of the photoluminescence of the QDs and by testing a vinylation reaction using an alkenylsulfone radical trap. The QDs were tested in a radical [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons and that requires the completion of two consecutive catalytic cycles. Several QDs such as CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell proved to be efficient photocatalysts for this reaction. Interestingly, the addition of a second shorter chain ligand to the QDs appeared to be essential to complete the second catalytic cycle and to obtain the desired bicyclic tropane derivatives. Finally, the scope of the [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction was explored for the best performing QDs and isolated yields that compare well with classical iridium photocatalysis were obtained.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational Screening of New Candidate Reactions with High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of a QM&#8208;augmented&#8208;GNN, trained on a recently generated computational dataset, a vast chemical space of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions is screened for bioorthogonal potential, i.&#8201;e., a balance between speed and selectivity. A broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity is identified as a potential starting point for future experimental development of new bioorthogonal click reactions.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05&#8201;% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within &#8764;2&#8211;3&#8197;kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.

         <title>Factors Influencing the Chemoselectivity of Pd(OAc)2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Reactions Involving 1,6&#8208;Enynes as a Substrate and PhI(OAc)2 as a Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions.







Abstract
It is well documented in the literature that 1,6&#8208;enynes are cyclized using PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst to yield cyclopropyl ketones. In contrast, it has been reported that when 1,6&#8208;enynes are substituted by a hydroxy group at the &#945;&#8208;position to the alkyne, the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction is altered, and polycyclic oxa&#8208;heterocycles are formed. This suggests that the hydroxy substituent plays a crucial role in changing the mechanism of the reaction. The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06&#8208;D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations. This study demonstrates that the electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions. In addition, it was found that (1) the hypervalent iodine reagent PIDA serves not only as an oxidant for the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), but also as a nucleophile that drives the acetoxypalladation step of the reaction, (2) the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) by the iodonium ion [PhIOAc]+ occurs via an interesting mechanism involving coordination of [PhIOAc]+ to the Pd(II) centre, followed by a twist in the hypervalent iodine, and (3) Pd &#960;&#8208;complexes are not very susceptible to oxidation. (4) A Pd(II) complex can be six coordinate if the Pd centre is partially oxidized.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Solid&#8208;State Na&#8208;Ion Conductor for Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy hexagonal&#8208;prismatic Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was successfully synthesized with a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. It demonstrates an excellent electrochemical stability and a superior compatibility with sodium. Solid&#8208;state batteries based on this material deliver almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) hold great promise for their merits in low&#8208;cost, high energy density, and safety. However, developing solid electrolyte (SE) materials for SSBs with high performance is still a great challenge. In this study, high&#8208;entropy Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was synthesized at comparatively low sintering temperature of 950&#8201;&#176;C with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. More importantly, the Na symmetric cells using high&#8208;entropy SE show a high critical current density of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outstanding rate performance with fairly flat potential profiles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and steady cycling over 700&#8197;h under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Na3V2(PO4)3||high&#8208;entropy SE||Na batteries are further assembled manifesting a desirable cycling stability with almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles and high Columbic efficiency over 99.9&#8201;%. The findings present opportunities for the design of high&#8208;entropy Na&#8208;ion conductors toward the development of SSBs.

         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphonium functionalization of a conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) with a stilbene core improved its spectrum of activity to include ESKAPE pathogens and mycobacteria while crucially retaining the membrane&#8208;perturbing mode of action characteristic of COEs. The efficacy of the lead compound in&#8197;vivo highlights the potential of the COE molecular platform for designing more effective antibiotics.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis enables an oxygen&#8208;sensitive energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalysed [2+2] photocycloaddition in water and under aerobic conditions. Micellar effects suppress undesired quenching of triplet states by molecular oxygen through low oxygen solubility and compartmentalization of the micellar reaction mixture. Additionally, activation of the substrates towards sensitization by hydrogen bonding in the Stern layer is proposed, allowing efficient triplet energy transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]2+.







Abstract
Micellar photocatalysis has been used to overcome oxygen quenching and enable a [2+2] photocycloaddition through triplet&#8208;energy transfer in water under aerobic conditions. The cheap and commercially available self&#8208;assembling sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were found to increase the oxygen tolerance of a typically oxygen&#8208;sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the use of the micellar solution was found to activate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds to energy transfer and allow [2+2] photocycloadditions to take place.

     alt="Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micellar photocatalysis&lt;/b&gt; enables an oxygen-sensitive energy-transfer-catalysed [2+2] photocycloaddition in water and under aerobic conditions. Micellar effects suppress undesired quenching of triplet states by molecular oxygen through low oxygen solubility and compartmentalization of the micellar reaction mixture. Additionally, activation of the substrates towards sensitization by hydrogen bonding in the Stern layer is proposed, allowing efficient triplet energy transfer from [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micellar photocatalysis has been used to overcome oxygen quenching and enable a [2+2] photocycloaddition through triplet-energy transfer in water under aerobic conditions. The cheap and commercially available self-assembling sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were found to increase the oxygen tolerance of a typically oxygen-sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the use of the micellar solution was found to activate &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds to energy transfer and allow [2+2] photocycloadditions to take place. Our preliminary studies of micellar effects on energy-transfer-based reactions demonstrate the reaction between &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes in a mixture of SDS, water and [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Use of Conglomerate Mixed Crystals to Deracemize a Stable Racemic&#8208;Compound&#8208;Forming System</title>

Deracemization of a solid solution: The deracemization of a racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming system by using the possibility of syncrystallization, that is the formation of solid solution, with a chemically related conglomerate&#8208;forming system has been demonstrated. Based on phase diagram study, three model compounds crystallizing as racemic compounds were deracemized this way giving the evidence of the concept.







Abstract
Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror&#8208;related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence for this possibility is given in three examples by using temperature&#8208;cycling&#8208;induced deracemization.

Acid test for Tyr and Trp: S&#8208;Acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) enables the residue&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfenylation of Tyr or Trp under appropriately selected acidic reaction conditions. The dicationic intermediate derived from the Cys(Acm)(O) selectively reacts with Tyr, whereas the S&#8208;chlorocysteine allows Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation. The one&#8208;pot sequence of stapling and lipidation of peptides was achieved.







Abstract
A tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208; or tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides 1 in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range, satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties was fabricated by using anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode. The H2O molecules in the organohydrogel are fixed in the 3D polyacrylamide network through the hydrogen bond interaction of ethylene glycol and ionic hydration of LiCl, thus greatly limiting their crystallization or evaporation at extreme temperatures. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300123).

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical assay for probing the cleavage of surface&#8208;confined APP peptide substrates by BACE1 was developed based on specific chemical labeling of terminal tyrosine.







Abstract
Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite is modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag (ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is captured in microplate surface by the conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode (SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1 to 200&#8197;pM with a detection limit of 0.8&#8197;pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.

         <dc:description>
The energy storage cycle of the molecular solar thermal (MOST) system has been investigated. In particular, upon irradiation, the energy&#8208;lean 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene is converted into its energy&#8208;rich quadricyclane isomer. The energy&#8208;releasing back reaction can be triggered thermally by means of a suitable catalyst surface. The differences in the energy landscapes is visualized by sea level and mountains. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Papp and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203739). Cover design by F. Hemauer.

         <title>Photoluminescent Properties and Mechanism of Novel Cyanine&#8208;Borondifluoride Curcuminoid Hybrids as Red&#8208;to&#8208;Near Infrared and Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeting Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been constructed by rational structural hybridization of cyanine and borondifluoride curcuminoid. The peculiar asymmetrical layout of the three key fragments endows these long&#8208;wavelength dyes with ideal photophysical properties and ER self&#8208;targeting capability. The photoluminescent mechanism, revealed by quantum chemical calculations, will greatly facilitate future exploration of cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized NIR dyes. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;R. Peterson, F. Feng, Q. Sun, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300315).

         <title>Organophosphorus Extractants: A Critical Choice for Actinides/Lanthanides Separation in Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of actinides from lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is a vital step of nuclear fuel cycle process. As one class of mature industrial extractants, the organophosphorus extractants have been widely used for the extraction and separation of actinides and lanthanides in spent fuel reprocessing due to their strong extraction ability and low&#8208;cost acquisition. In this concept, the application scope of tributyl phosphate (TBP), bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP), octyl(phenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO), trialkyl phosphine oxide (TRPO), and purified Cyanex 301 (bis(2,4,4&#8208;trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid, HA301) are introduced, and their extraction mechanism, as well as structure&#8208;function relationships for separation of actinides over lanthanides are also discussed. Furthermore, the design criteria, extraction properties and mechanism of several typical newly developed organophosphorus extractants (CMPO&#8208;modified calixarene/pillarene, phenanthroline&#8208;derived organophosphorus extractants, and phosphate&#8208;modified carborane) based on pre&#8208;organized skeletons are briefly reviewed. Finally, we summarize and emphasize the important role played by those organophosphorus extractants and look forward to their potential applications in separation of actinides over lanthanides in future advanced nuclear fuel cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>From chemotherapy to phototherapy &#8208; changing the therapeutic action of a metallo&#8208;intercalating RuII&#8208;ReI luminescent system by switching its sub&#8208;cellular location.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a new heterodinuclear ReIRuII metallointercalator containing RuII(dppz) and ReI(dppn) moieties is reported. Cell&#8208;free studies reveal that the complex has similar photophysical properties to its homoleptic M(dppz) analogue and it also binds to DNA with a similar affinity. However, the newly reported complex has very different in&#8208;cell properties to its parent. In complete contrast to the homoleptic system, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex is not intrinsically cytotoxic but displays appreciable phototoxic, despite both complexes displaying very similar quantum yields for singlet oxygen sensitization. Optical microscopy suggests that the reason for these contrasting biological effects is that whereas the homoleptic complex localises in the nuclei of cells, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex preferentially accumulates in mitochondria. These observations illustrate how even small structural changes in metal based therapeutic leads can modulate their mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretching the Bisalkyne Raman Spectral Palette Reveals a New Electrophilic Covalent Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small heteroaryl&#8208;diyne (Het&#8208;DY) tags with distinct vibrational frequencies, and physiologically relevant cLog P were designed for multiplexed bioorthogonal Raman imaging. Pd&#8208;Cu catalyzed coupling, combined with the use of Lei ligand, was shown to improve overall yields of the desired heterocoupled Het&#8208;Dy tags, minimizing the production of homocoupled side&#8208;products. Spectral data were in agreement with the trends predicted by DFT calculations and systematic introduction of electron&#8208;rich/poor rings stretched the frequency limit of aryl&#8208;capped diynes (2209&#8208;2243 cm&#8208;1). The improved Log P of these Het&#8208;Dy tags was evident from their diffuse distribution in cellular uptake studies and functionalizing tags with organelle markers allowed the acquisition of location&#8208;specific biological images. LC&#8208;MS&#8208; and NMR&#8208;based assays showed that some heteroaryl&#8208;capped internal alkynes are potential nucleophile traps with structure&#8208;dependent reactivity. These biocompatible Het&#8208;Dy tags, equipped with covalent reactivity, open up new avenues for Raman bioorthogonal imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#181;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X = CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn = CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2 M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depend on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8208;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et &#8594; CH2Ph replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination vs. Insertion: On the Interaction of 5d&#8208;Transition Metal Carbonyl Clusters with Silver(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The title silver(I) complex salts [Ag{Re2(CO)10}{Re(CO)5}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgRe4; ORF = &#8208;OC(CF3)3) and [Ag{Ir4(CO)12}2]+&#173;[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgIr8) form upon reaction of Ag+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and the transition metal carbonyls (TMCs) Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 respectively. The solid&#8208;state structure of the AgRe4 cluster shows an unexpected asymmetric coordination motif, wherein the silver(I) cation has inserted into the Re&#8208;Re bond of one Re2(CO)10 moiety, while the other dirhenium carbonyl coordinates only over one metal atom towards the silver(I) cation. The AgIr8 cluster is formed by the edge&#8208;on coordination of two Ir4 tetrahedra and the silver cation in a D2 symmetric fashion with a torsion angle of 46.5&#176;. The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths between the silver atom and the nearby metal atoms in all cases, whereas only the non&#8208;inserted Re2(CO)10 moiety shows additional bond paths between the carbonyl ligands and the silver cation. In addition, the insertion of the Ag+ cation into the Re&#8208;Re bond in Re2(CO)10 removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered TMC donors W(CO)6 &lt; Re2(CO)10 &lt; Os3(CO)12 &lt; Ir4(CO)12. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;&#8208;donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag+&#8592;[TMC].</dc:description>

In addition, the insertion of the Ag+ cation into the Re-Re bond in Re2(CO)10 removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA-NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered TMC donors W(CO)6 &amp;lt; Re2(CO)10 &amp;lt; Os3(CO)12 &amp;lt; Ir4(CO)12. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;-donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag+&#8592;[TMC].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Efficient Light&#8208;mediated Protocol for the Direct Amide Bond Formation via a Novel Carboxylic Acid Photoactivation Mode by Pyridine&#8211;CBr4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct amide bond formation between a carboxylic acid and an amine still constitutes a challenging reaction for both academia and industry. We demonstrate herein that several pairs of amines (halogen bond acceptors) and organohalogen sources may be used for the photochemical amidation reaction under either UVA or sunlight irradiation. Our studies led to the identification of pyridine&#8211;CBr4 as an efficient agent to perform synthesis of amides under LED 370 nm irradiation, avoiding super&#8208;stoichiometric quantities. An extended substrate scope was demonstrated, showing that the widely used amino and carboxyl protecting groups are compatible with this photochemical protocol, while a number of industrially interesting products and bioactive compounds were synthesized. Direct infusion&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry studies suggest an unprecedented type of carboxylic acid activation mode upon irradiation, involving the generation of a symmetric anhydride, an active ester with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and a mixed anhydride with hypobromous acid.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A precise investigation of NbO has been carried out by advanced electron microscopy combined with powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). The structure of pristine NbO has been determined as Pm&#8208;3m space group (SG) with a=4.211 &#197; and the positions of Nb and O at the 3c and 3d Wyckoff positions, respectively, which is consistent with previous report based on powder XRD data. Electron beams induced a structural transition, which was investigated and explained by combining electron diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution imaging. The results revealed that the electron beam stimulated both Nb and O atom&#8208;migrations within each fcc sublattice, and that the final structure was SG Fm&#8208;3m with a=4.29 &#197;, Nb and O at the 4a and 4b with 75% occupancy and same chemical composition. Antiphase planar defects were discovered in the pristine NbO and related to the structural transformation. Theoretical calculations performed by density functional theory (DFT) supported the experimental conclusions.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Screening of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial for renewable energy technologies. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) methods and microkinetic simulations, we systematically investigated the ORR catalytic performance of a series of 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks M3(HADQ)2 (HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline). It shows that all 2D M3(HADQ)2 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh and Pd) monolayers are metallic, due to &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystal orbitals centered on the central metals and ligand N atoms. The catalytic activity of M3(HADQ)2 depends on the binding strength between ORR intermediates and metal species, and can be tuned via changing the central metals. Among these candidates, Rh3(HADQ)2 and Co3(HADQ)2 show superior ORR performance to Pt (111) with high half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.99 and 0.93 V, respectively. Moreover, the screened two catalysts have excellent intermediate&#8208;tolerance ability for dynamic coverage of oxygenated species on the active sites. Our work provides a new path towards developing efficient ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of the Reaction of Elemental Sulfur and Polysulfides with Cyanide and Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of elemental sulfur (S8) and polysulfides with nucleophiles are relevant to organic synthesis, materials science and biochemistry, but the mechanisms by which they operate are still unknown due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // &#969;B97X&#8208;D/ aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, we studied the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. All plausible pathways including nucleophilic decomposition, unimolecular decomposition, scrambling reactions, and attack on thiosulfoxides, have been considered to provide the first comprehensive mechanistic picture for this class of reactions. Overall, intramolecular cyclization is identified as the most favorable decomposition pathway for long polysulfides. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition, nucleophilic attack, and scrambling pathways can be expected.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new mononuclear cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S5)] (3) has been synthesized using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R = Ph, 2a; 2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H4, 2b), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)2Co2]2+ (1). Compound 3 features a low spin, diamagnetic, Co(III) centre with a coordinated pentasulfido (S52&#8315;) chain and has no precedence in the literature. Compound 3 is highly stable towards reduction with a potential of &#8208;1.36 V (vs. Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe) and gives back 1 upon chemical/electrochemical reduction. Reaction of 3 with phosphines yields back 1 and phosphine sulfides, while protonation of the coordinated S52&#8315; chain in 3 leads to the formation of 1, elemental sulfur and H2S. Finally, transfer of the coordinated S52&#8315; chain in 3 to selected organic compounds, such as MeI, PhCH2Br and PhCOCl, for the generation of organopolysulfido compounds has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of 16&#8201;chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable NHCs was synthesized in good yields with excellent enantiomeric purities (up &gt;99.75&#8201;:&#8201;0.25&#8197;er). The chiral BIAN&#8208;based Ru&#8208;complexes Ru&#8208;4&#8201;g was the most efficient to catalyse the AROCM of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;norbornenes (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Successfully converted into its corresponding Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex Z&#8208;Ru&#8208;5, the latter demonstrated high efficiency in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes in &gt;98&#8201;% Z&#8208;selectivity and the highest enantioselectivities reported so far (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).







Abstract
A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral atropBIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).

Successfully converted into its corresponding &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective catechodithiolate complex &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Ru-5&lt;/b&gt;, the latter demonstrated high efficiency in &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective AROCM of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-norbornenes affording valuable &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclopentanes in &amp;gt;98&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity and the highest enantioselectivities reported so far (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N-Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring-opening-cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;atrop&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;BIAN-NHC Ru-catalyst (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er) was then converted to a &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selective AROCM of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-norbornenes affording valuable &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclopentanes with excellent &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity (&amp;gt;98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correlation of Experimental and Calculated Reaction Enthalpies with Ligand Donor Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calorimetric studies on the formation of [(YPhos)AuCl] complexes confirmed the high binding strength of these ligands. The reaction enthalpies are shown to be easily obtained by calculations and correlate with the phosphine donor properties thus representing an interesting problem&#8208;specific descriptor for ligands in gold catalysis.







Abstract
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) have recently proven to be strongly donating ligands that enable high catalyst activities in gold(I)&#8208;mediated transformations. We now report on a calorimetric study dealing with the [Au(YPhos)Cl] system and assess YPhos&#8208;Au bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy&#8208;to&#8208;obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis and Characterization of Indenone Azine&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Accepting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be more accepting: Indenone azines, in which two indene units are cross&#8208;conjugated by an exocyclic azine (C=N&#8722;N=C) moiety, have been synthesized in a stereocontrolled manner. The azine moiety makes indenone azines planar structure and gives enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character, thus making them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks.







Abstract
Indenone azines, in which the exocyclic C=C bond in dibenzopentafulvalene is replaced by an azine moiety (C=N&#8722;N=C), have been synthesized as novel electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds. Structural modulation at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions of indenone azines enabled stereoselective syntheses of diastereomers in which the configurations of the two C=N bonds are E,E or Z,Z. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that all the indenone azines exhibit high coplanarity in contrast to the twisted frameworks of dibenzopentafulvalene derivatives, resulting in the formation of densely &#960;&#8208;stacked structures. Electrochemical measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed the electron&#8208;accepting character of indenone azines comparable to isoindigo dyes. In particular, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives impart enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and significantly red&#8208;shifted photoabsorption. This study demonstrates that indenone azines represent a promising candidate as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks for optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Copper Activation Enabling Reversible Aqueous Cu&#8722;ZnS Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries have been proposed: ZnS is gradually activated by copper to form CuS under electric field during cycling. The formed CuS undergoes a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S for energy storage. The introduction of sphalerite activation in the field of mining and metallurgy provides an idea for the design of materials design for aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries (AMSBs) have attracted research interest due to their high capacity, environmentally friendly qualities, and the accessibility of raw materials. However, the design strategies for metal&#8208;sulfide cathode have rarely been reported. Here, the copper&#8208;activated sphalerite in which Zn2+ is substituted by Cu2+ through ion exchange has been introduced for the first time as cathode for aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries. After sphalerite transformed to CuS, a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S storage mechanism has been proposed. At 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density, the capacity can reach 532.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. When cycled once at a current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial reversible capacity can reach 461&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the assembled Zn//ZnS hybrid ion cell delivers an energy of up to 460&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is better than for many AMSBs.

         <title>Interface Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells through Potassium Citrate Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of potassium citrate (PC) passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficiency and stability are key factors determining the final cost of electricity that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generate. To date, effective strategy to progress in achieving efficient and stable PSCs is still a difficult problem that researchers continue to explore. This study reports a useful way to improve the quality of SnO2 film by introducing potassium citrate (PC) into SnO2 nanoparticles solution. PC passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2. The resultant photovoltaic (PV) device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.79&#8201;%. The introduction of PC interface also significantly suppress the degradation of PSCs, by which 87.6&#8201;% of initial PCE is maintained after 2850&#8197;h storage in ambient environment. Moreover, the devices retained 95.5&#8201;% of initial PCE under 1&#8208;sun continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

&#8220;This study tests the hypothesis that local interactions in the non&#8208;heme FeII centers of PHF8 and EFE control the differences in dioxygen and 2OG binding modes to generate off&#8208;line or in&#8208;line FeIII&#8722;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediates.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202300138).

         <title>Construction of Pd&#8208;Co&#8208;doped CdS heterojunctions as efficient platforms in photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present the structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of CdS semiconducting nanostructures, doped with palladium&#8208; and cobalt&#8208;based species. XRD analysis, corroborated by Raman and XPS, demonstrated the growth of CdS crystallites in the hexagonal structure, whereas solvothermal conversion of neat precursor metal salts resulted in the formation of metallic Pd and cobalt oxide, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy imaging certified the dendritic structure of hybrids, especially in the case where CdS was grown in the presence of either palladium&#8208; or cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles. XPS surface analysis revealed that a major fraction of metallic Pd nanoparticles was converted to PdO during the in situ growth of CdS nanoparticles. The oxidation of Pd nanoparticles could be ascribed to chemisorption of oxygen phases onto the metal surface. The presence of cocatalyst nanoparticles resulted in an appreciable shift of the absorption edge of the ternary hybrids by about 50 nm. The optimized hybrid was found to photodegrade Orange G dye almost quantitatively within 2 h, by simulated solar light irradiation. Scavenging experiments revealed that hydroxy radicals were the main transient intermediate, leading to the oxidative degradation of the dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Differences in Ambident Reactivity between the Cyanate, Thiocyanate Ions, and their P&#8208; and As&#8208;Containing Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the cyanate and thiocyanate anions belong to the most known textbook examples of ambident nucleophiles, the electronic factors that determine their markedly differing reactivities are still unclear. Their recently discovered P&#8208; and As&#8208;containing [PCX]&#8211; and [AsCX]&#8211;analogues (X: O, S, Se), whose ambident nature is practically unexplored, may serve as ideal basis for comparison to clarify these differences. Herein we present comprehensive theoretical investigations on the nucleophilic behaviours of the whole set of so far known [ECX]&#8211;(E: N, P, As, X: O, S, Se) anions, aiming for a systematic understanding of the reactivity patterns and deciphering the factors that govern the nucleophilic substitutions. Our results indicate that the SN2 reactions of the O&#8208;containing [ECO]&#8211; ions are thermodynamically preferred at the E pnictogen centres, while the kinetic contributions are only substantial for the N&#8208;containing [NCX]&#8211;anions. The ambident reactivities of the congeners that contain N or O significantly differ from those with P, As, S, or Se heteroatoms, in line with the inert s&#8208;orbital effect, characteristic for the heavier elements. By analysing the electronic structures and bonding patterns of the anions and relevant transition state structures, we offer clear explanations for the differing reactivities of the whole set of [ECX]&#8211;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effects toward Dual&#8208;State Emissive Bright Red and Near&#8208;infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission effect (REE) was discovered and resulted in a novel dye family of hydrostyryl pyridinium derivatives in our recent work. Herein, REE effect was employed to design red and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;state emissive fluorophore family of SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s which were further easily synthesized by couple an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) onto nitro(hydroxyl)styryl (S&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) through a C=C double bond as &#960;&#8208;bridge. The deprotonation of phenolic hydroxyl group promoted by nitro group and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) in the other side of &#960;&#8208;bridge triggered resonance and resulting in significantly red&#8208;shifted emission. All the resultant SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s showed excellent dual&#8208;state emission behaviors. Remarkably, hydrostyryl quinolinium (SQ&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) is one of the smallest NIR emitters molecular skeleton (&#955;em = 725 nm, MW&lt;400) and showed dual&#8208;state emission characteristics and obvious viscosity&#8208;depended fluorescent behaviors. In addition to constructing electron donor&#8208;accepter structure and prolonging &#960;&#8208;bridge, REE effected promised a reliable strategy toward novel fluorophores with small size, long emissive wavelength, and dual&#8208;emission characteristics, and importantly, feasible industrial manufactures and applications due to their easy and low&#8208;cost synthesis strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>BAr2&#8208;bridged Azafulvene Dimers with Tunable Energy Levels for Photostable Near&#8208;infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes with strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are potentially useful in medical applications such as tumor imaging and photothermal therapy. In this work, we synthesized new NIR dyes combining BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer acceptors with diarylaminothienyl donors in a donor&#8722;acceptor&#8722;donor configuration. Surprisingly, we found that in these molecules the BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene acceptor adopts a 5&#8208;membered, rather than 6&#8208;membered ring structure. The influence of the aryl substituents on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye compounds was assessed from electrochemical and optical measurements. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents (Ar = C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) lowered the HOMO energy while preserving the small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, resulting in promising NIR dye molecules that combine strong absorption bands centered around 900 nm with good photostability.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.g. Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation via neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure activity relationships (ASARs).</dc:description>

         <title>Excited state processes in supramolecular complexes of cyclic dibenzopyrrolopyrroles isomers with C60 fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach to modulating the properties of carbon nanorings by incorporating pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units is of particular interest due to the combined effect of heteroatom and antiaromatic character on electronic properties. The inclusion of units other than phenylene leads to the formation of stereoisomers. In this work, we computationally study how the spatial orientation of monomeric units in the ring affects the properties of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles and their complexes with C60 fullerene. For [4]PP and [4]DHPP, the most symmetrical AAAA isomer is the most stable and forms stronger interactions with fullerene than the isomers where one or two monomeric units are flipped, mostly due to less Pauli repulsion. p&#8208;Electron delocalization in the monomeric unit is crucial for directing the electron transfer (from or to nanoring). The energy of charge transfer excited states depends on the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, which varies from one stereoisomer to another only for [4]DHPP&#8835;C60 with aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units. The rates of electron transfer and charge recombination reactions are relatively weakly dependent of the spatial isomerism of nanorings.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Approach for the Synthesis of Site&#8208;Specific Thioether Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioconjugation methodologies have become a central part of therapeutic development. Conjugation of thiol&#8208;containing compounds is now simple with this ionic liquid&#8208;mediated reaction which is site&#8208;specific toward thiol and preserves the stereochemistry. Additionally, Cysteine&#8208;free peptides can be functionalized using the developed technique.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.

By the Bi: The bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+, stabilized by an [SbF6]&#8722; counteranion, has been synthesized, isolated and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). A detailed comparison with [BiMe2(SbF6)] highlights the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity.

Abstract
The molecular compound [BiDipp2(SbF6)], containing the bulky, donor&#8208;free bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+ has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Using its methyl analog [BiMe2(SbF6)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity was investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and modified Gutmann&#8208;Beckett methods) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards [PF6]&#8722; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively. The first examples of compounds featuring bismuth&#8208;bound isocyanides have been isolated and fully characterized.

         <title>Molecular Shape, Electronic Factors, and the Ferroelectric Nematic Phase: Investigating the Impact of Structural Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular shape and its effects: The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens is reported comparing the effect of having a lateral alkoxy chain in the central phenyl ring versus the chain being attached to the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. Rather than the molecule being required to show a tapered shape, it is the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations that is key.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to the central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited an N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of the ferroelectric nematic&#8208;nematic transition temperature, T
, exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically on the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour was found when the transition temperatures of the NF phase were compared which are higher for the NT3F.m series. This may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of the NT3F.m series compared to the NT3.m series. Therefore, it is suggested that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent cages allow for the detection of the persistent organic pollutant chlordecone in water at environmental concentrations. The reported method is inexpensive, easy to carry out, and of general use for generating many measurements on contaminated water samples. This provides an affordable tool to tackle the major environmental and public health issues associated with chlordecone contamination.







Abstract
Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. This study reports on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted the choice of hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, were optimized to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed the development of a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Based on its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane, concentration, CLD concentrations were estimated over five orders of magnitude (10&#8722;2&#8211;103&#8197;&#956;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.

The reported method is inexpensive, easy to carry out, and of general use for generating many measurements on contaminated water samples. This provides an affordable tool to tackle the major environmental and public health issues associated with chlordecone contamination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non-expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone-free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. This study reports on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted the choice of hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, were optimized to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed the development of a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Based on its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane, concentration, CLD concentrations were estimated over five orders of magnitude (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;&#956;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Synthesis of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective electrophilic activation of amides and enols/ketones has been achieved using either Hendrickson reagent in combination with triflic anhydride or triflic acid, which provides an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of polysubstituted indoles with flexible substituent patterns from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides or their enol&#8208;keto tautomeric mixture.







Abstract
A facile and efficient synthesis of polysubstituted indoles from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides, or their tautomeric mixture via electrophilic activation strategy is described. The salient feature of this methodology is the use of either combined Hendrickson reagent and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) or triflic acid (TfOH) to control the chemoselectivity in the intramolecular cyclodehydration to provide a predictable approach to these valuable indoles with flexible substituent patterns. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions, simple execution, high chemoselectivity, excellent yields, and wide range of synthetic potential of products make this protocol much attractive for academic research and practical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Open&#8208;Close Motion of a Chiral Molecular Plier to Modulate Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered configuration change (azobenzene) of one end of a molecular plier induces an interlocking motion at the other end (porphyrin unit) of the plier accompanied by a pivotal motion around the BINOL axis. E to Z isomerization decreases the distance between two porphyrin units which could be used for selective binding of pyridine&#8208;appended guests. Guest complexation with the plier increases the isomerization efficiency of azobenzene and decreases the thermal back isomerization rate.







Abstract
A chiral molecular plier's design, synthesis, characterisation and operations are presented. The molecular plier encompasses three units: a BINOL unit which acts as a pivot as well as a chiral inducer, an azobenzene unit, which acts as a photo&#8208;switchable component and two zinc porphyrin, acting as a reporter. E to Z isomerisation persuaded by irradiating with 370&#8197;nm light alters the dihedral angle of the pivot BINOL unit, which adjusts the distance between two porphyrin units. The plier can be switched to its initial state by exposure to 456&#8197;nm light or heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C. NMR, CD and molecular modelling supported the reversible switching and change in dihedral angle and distance between reporter moiety, which was further exploited for binding with several ditopic guests. The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, R,R&#8208;isomer formed a stronger complex than S,S&#8208;isomer, Z&#8208;isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the E&#8208;isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.

         <title>An Umpolung Approach to Acyclic 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Amides via Photoredox&#8208;Generated Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis is used to generate carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts. Addition to a range of electron&#8208;poor olefins gives the 1,4&#8208;amido&#8208;carbonyl products in good yields. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, and a transition metal or organic photocatalyst can be employed.







Abstract
A method for the generation and reaction of carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts, followed by reaction with electron&#8208;poor olefins, is described. The oxamate salt acts as a reductive quencher in the photoredox catalytic cycle, allowing mild and mass&#8208;efficient formation of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products; a challenging transformation in the context of functionalized amide formation. Increased understanding has been obtained by the use of ab initio calculations, in support of experimental observations. Furthermore, steps have been taken towards an environmentally&#8208;friendly protocol, by utilizing sodium as a cheap and low mass counterion, and demonstrating successful reactions using a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and a sustainable, non&#8208;toxic solvent system.

         <title>A Cyclodextrin Polymer as Supramolecular Matrix for Scalable Green Photooxygenation of Hydrophobic Substrates in Homogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic endoperoxides were synthesized as O2 releasing agents in organic solvent upon irradiation of a photocatalyst in the presence of the precursors in mM concentration. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both reactants in a cyclodextrin polymer allowed to successfully perform the photocatalyzed oxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment. Controlled release of O2 could be achieved upon thermolysis.







Abstract
In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2 in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.

         <title>A Highly Active Cobalt Catalyst for the General and Selective Hydrogenation of Aromatic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active cobalt catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;heterocycles was identified. The key is a simple three component catalyst synthesis permitting to optimize the ratio between N&#8208;doped carbon for embedding and the metal species to be embedded.







Abstract
Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. This study introduces a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying this catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.

The key is a simple three component catalyst synthesis permitting to optimize the ratio between N-doped carbon for embedding and the metal species to be embedded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. This study introduces a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying this catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N-, O- and S-heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Strategy for Sequence&#8208;Dependent and Thermo/pH Dual&#8208;Responsive Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of monomer sequence for desired properties is challenging. This study investigates the effect of monomer distribution of double hydrophilic copolymers (DHCs) with electron&#8208;rich units on cluster triggered emission (CTE) capacity. By means of combining latent monomer strategy, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and selective hydrolysis technology, the random, pseudo di&#8208;block and the gradient DHCs consisting of pH&#8208;responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA) segments and thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) segments were successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. Moreover, the gradient DHCs showed a tremendously increased luminescent intensity due to the distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction compared to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported the direct correlation between luminescent intensity and sequence structure of non&#8208;conjugated polymer. Meanwhile, thermo and pH dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence could be easily performed. This work demonstrates a novel and facile method to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;bonding for the stimuli&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Boronic Acid Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functional RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronate esters formed by reaction of an oligonucleotide carrying a 5'&#8208;boronic acid moiety with the 3'&#8208;terminal cis&#8208;diol of another have been shown previously to assist assembly of fragmented DNAzymes. Here we demonstrate that boronate esters replacing the natural phosphodiester linkage at selected sites of two functional RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the Mango aptamer, allow assembly of functional structures. The hairpin ribozyme, a small naturally occurring RNA that supports the reversible cleavage of appropriate RNA substrates, is very sensitive to fragmentation. Splitting the ribozyme at four different sites led to a significant decrease or even loss of cleavage and ligation activity. Ribozymes assembled from fragments capable of boronate ester formation showed restoration of cleavage activity in some but not all cases, dependent on the split site. Ligation proved to be more challenging, no supportive effect of the boronate ester was observed. Split variants of the Mango aptamer also showed a dramatic loss of functionality, which however, was restored when 5'&#8208;boronic acid modified fragments were used for assembly. These studies show for the first time that boronate esters as internucleoside linkages can act as surrogates of natural phosphodiesters in functional RNA molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Stabilized Thiyl Radicals Design Inspired by Elemental Periodic Extension Notion for Ligand&#8208;based Alkene Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by alkene addition to the Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes via carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation/cleavage reactions along with a periodic extension catalysis notion, a comparative study of the electronic structures, mechanisms, and reactivities for ethylene addition to the Os and Tc tris(thiolate) complexes was performed by DFT and high&#8208;level ab initio quantum calculations. The oxidized Os and Tc complexes were revealed to exhibit sufficient radical characters on the ligands to support their reaction with ethylene, whereas neutral Tc complex featuring little thiyl radical character renders no reactivity toward ethylene. Differential reactivities of these tris(thiolate) complexes was deemed to derive from the synergy of the thiyl radical character, the electronegativity, the row, and the charge. Extending from Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes to their Os and Tc counterparts can help us to get insightful rationales that would promote further research on alkene addition to metal&#8208;stabilized thiyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Selective and Quantitative Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Diagnostic Method for Adrenaline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a neurotransmitter/hormone that is an important target in diagnostics. Development of&#160;an effective method for detecting it in the presence of other neurotransmitters is a challenging task. The electrochemical and fluorescent techniques commonly used have low selectivity in distinguishing among catecholamines. Herein, we report a small molecule organic probe with an activated furfural moiety to exploit the nucleophilicity of epinephrine to generate a bright&#8208;colored donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct. Among nine common&#160;neurotransmitters or their&#160;analogues, only epinephrine was found to generate a unique&#160;colour change&#160;discernible with the naked eye, whereas the other ones remain unaffected. Under various in&#8208;field detection conditions, including solution, droplet, and paper strip&#8208;based detection, the&#160;colour change&#160;were also&#160;noticeable. The low detection limit of 1.37 nM and a limit of quantitation of 4.37 nM were achieved with simple UV&#8208;vis methods in addition to the sub&#8208;ppm level sensing under visual conditions with naked eyes. The probe could be used for practical colorimetric measurements as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care tool without any complex and expensive machinery, making this approach accessible to all. In addition, using a simple smartphone, the determination of epinephrine concentrations is possible using machine&#8208;learning techniques.</dc:description>

Preparation of spherical polymeric particles via surfactant&#8208;free RAFT emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) with reversible swelling behavior upon UV/Vis light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) assembled by monodisperse colloidal particles have attracted enormous interest recently due to their tremendous applications in smart devices. Their structural colors can be determined by particle sizes. However, the lack of a reliable way to tune the sizes in&#8197;situ limits their development. Herein, we present an efficient route to solve this problem through the fabrication of spherical polymeric particles with light&#8208;triggered reversible swelling behavior via surfactant&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Amphiphilic macro&#8208;RAFT agents containing azobenzene groups were synthesized and subsequently employed to mediate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Uniform submicron spheres were obtained by modulating solid contents and other parameters. Benefiting from the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties, the particle sizes expanded and contracted upon alternative ultraviolet/visible&#8208;light irradiation accordingly. This strategy will be a supplement to the emulsion PISA and especially give aid to the progress of the RPC materials.

         <title>Chemistry, Chemo&#8208;Ecology, and Biological Activities of Uncommon and Structurally Diverse Sesquiterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, of which sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core.

Abstract
A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids wasproposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch &lt;i&gt;Hexabranchus sanguineus&lt;/i&gt; yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene-2,3&#8242;-pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical-nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane-type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids wasproposed and discussed, and a chemo-ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed. In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-formamidogorgon-11-ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;M.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Non Expected Alternative Ni(0) Species in the Ni&#8208;Catalytic Aldehyde and Alcohol Arylation Reactions Facilitated by a 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
As in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, in the alcohol arylation reaction catalysed by a system combining nickel and a 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand, the presence of a Ni(0) intermediate is under debate by Density Functional Theory calculations.







Abstract
For decades there were many attempts to dispense with stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents for the synthesis of secondary alcohols. In 2021, the synthetic results of Newman and collaborators pioneered a synthesis still with metals, but not as reactants. Instead, they serverd as catalytic engines. Here we present a description by means of Density Functional Theory calculations of how this process can occur, and an attempt is made to shed light on the mechanism that facilitates the attainment of secondary alcohols, emphasizing the eternal cross&#8208;coupling debate of whether the catalytically active species is Ni(0) or they are really taking shortcuts following the course of Ni(II). Effective Orbital analyses give a clear picture. Furthermore, this paper provides insight not only into the nature of the ligands of the metal catalyst but also the role of the base.

         <title>Control of Selectivity in Homogeneous Catalysis through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity directing mission of noncovalent interactions (hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen and tetrel bonds, as well as agostic and &#960;&#8208;interactions) in homogeneous catalysis is highlighted. The origin of the selectivity in noncovalent catalysis has been investigated through experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
The regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, stereo&#8208; or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi&#8208;steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst&#8208;substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.

         <title>Progress in Predicting Ionic Cocrystal Formation: The Case of Ammonium Nitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cocrystal design strategies are rapidly evolving to enhance predictive capabilities and improve the efficiency of coformer screening. However, many of the molecular descriptors associated with successful cocrystallization are ambiguous for salts, complicating coformer selection when designing ionic cocrystals. Herein, a study of ammonium nitrate ionic cocrystals reveals packing coefficient as a promising indicator for coformer success.







Abstract
In contrast to the mature predictive frameworks applied to neutral cocrystals, ionic cocrystals, those including an ion pair, are difficult to design. Furthermore, they are generally excluded categorically from studies which correlate specific molecular properties to cocrystal formation, leaving the prospective ionic cocrystal engineer with few clear avenues to success. Herein ammonium nitrate, an energetic oxidizing salt, is targeted for cocrystallization in a potential coformer group selected based on likely interactions with the nitrate ion as revealed in the Cambridge Structural Database; six novel ionic cocrystals were discovered. Molecular descriptors previously identified as being related to neutral cocrystal formation were examined across the screening group but showed no relationship with ionic cocrystal formation. High packing coefficient is shown to be a constant among the successful coformers in the set and is utilized to directly target two more successful coformers, bypassing the need for a large screening group.

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions&#8208;Assisted Polymorphism and Unique Mechanofluorochromism in 9,10&#8208;Bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated DSA derivative with two crystalline polymorphs and a nanocrystal were developed to explore the tricolor luminescence switching properties. One of the polymorphs exhibits rarely seen F&#8230;F interactions in its crystalline arrangement. On solvent fuming, the ground polymorphic crystals restored to a much more blue&#8208;shifted thermodynamically stable state, nearly identical to the nanocrystals developed at aggregating conditions.







Abstract
A fluorinated distyrylanthracene (DSA) derivative, 9, 10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene abbreviated as 4FDSA with two crystalline polymorphs (4FDSA&#8208;G (green emission) and 4FDSA&#8208;O (orange emission)), showing remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission and mechanofluorochromic characteristics, was developed. One of the polymorphs in its crystalline arrangement exhibits the hardly seen F&#8230;F interactions. It questions the conventional belief of the non&#8208;polarisable nature of fluorine atoms in forming the halogen bond. The twisted molecular conformation facilitated by the various supramolecular interactions resulted in the formation of another intensely emissive bluer nanocrystal (4FDSA&#8208;NC) at aggregating conditions. Even though, the both polymorphs show distinct tricolor luminescence switching on the action of mechanical force, fumigation of ground crystals with solvent vapor resulted in the formation of a more thermodynamically favorable 4FDSA&#8208;NC form. The work demonstrates the effect of supramolecular interactions assisted conformational changes in tuning the unique mechanofluorochromic characteristics of the polymorphic crystals.

         <title>Dioxygen Binding Is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non&#8208;heme FeII and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Oxygenases: A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover shows the oxygen diffusion channel in class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE). PHF8 catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3&#8197;K9me2 histone substrate, and EFE catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially have an off&#8208;line 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) conformation, upon oxygen binding, PHF8 forms an in&#8208;line superoxo complex, whereas EFE uses the off&#8208;line superoxo complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z. Christov and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300138).

     alt="Dioxygen Binding Is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non-heme FeII and 2-Oxoglutarate Oxygenases: A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene-Forming Enzyme"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cover shows the oxygen diffusion channel&lt;/b&gt; in class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE). PHF8 catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3&#8197;K9me2 histone substrate, and EFE catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially have an &lt;i&gt;off-line&lt;/i&gt; 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) conformation, upon oxygen binding, PHF8 forms an &lt;i&gt;in-line&lt;/i&gt; superoxo complex, whereas EFE uses the &lt;i&gt;off-line&lt;/i&gt; superoxo complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z. Christov and co-workers. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202300138"&gt;10.1002/chem.202300138&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Bonding in Low&#8208;Coordinated Organoarsenic and Organoantimony Compounds: A Threshold Photoelectron Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl and methylene compounds of arsenic and antimony are studied by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate their relative stability. While for As both HAs=CH2, As&#8208;CH3 and the methylene compound As=CH2 are identified in the spectrum, the only Sb compound observed is Sb&#8208;CH3. Thus, there is a step in the main group 15 between As and Sb, regarding the relative stability of the methyl compounds. Ionization energies, vibrational frequencies and spin&#8208;orbit splittings are determined for the methyl compound from photoion mass&#8208;selected photoelectron spectra. Although the spectroscopic results for organoantimony resemble those for the previously investigated bismuth compounds, EPR spectroscopic experiments indicate for Sb(CH3)3 a far lower tendency for methyl transfer compared to Bi(CH3)3. The present study concludes investigations on low&#8208;valent organopnictogen compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: The Role of the Nanohoop Size.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of p&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a huge impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and the study of the first example of cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8209;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole [5]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8209;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole [4]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. Particularly, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22 &#215; 10&#8209;5vs 1.04 &#215; 10&#8209;5 cm&#178;.V&#8208;1.s&#8208;1). However, the study of the other OFET characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for a good organization of the molecules in thin films whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Minimizing Product Inhibition in DNA Self&#8208;Replication: Insights for Prebiotic Replication from the Role of the Enzyme in Lesion&#8208;Induced DNA Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life as such reported&#160;systems are strongly hindered by product inhibition. Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self&#8208;replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction, lesion&#8208;induced DNA amplification (LIDA), can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved. To identify the unknown factors that lead LIDA to overcome product inhibition&#160;we have employed isothermal titration calorimetry&#160;and global fitting of time&#8208;dependent ligation data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We find that incorporating the abasic lesion into one of the four primers substantially decreases the stability difference between the product and intermediate complexes compared with complexes without the abasic group. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase this stability gap is further reduced by two orders of magnitude revealing that&#160;the ligase also helps overcome product inhibition. Kinetic simulations reveal&#160;that the intermediate complex stability and the magnitude of the ligation rate constant significantly impact the rate of self&#8208;replication, suggesting that catalysts that both facilitate ligation and stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to efficient nonenzymatic replication.</dc:description>

         <title>Unique Tubular BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunction with Efficient Separation of Charge Carriers for Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The industrial ammonia synthesis process consumes a lot of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. As a sustainable approach for ammonia synthesis, photocatalytic nitrogen reduction employing water as the reducing agent has a lot of potential. A simple surfactant&#8208;assisted solvothermal method is used to synthesize g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes with flower&#8208;like spherical BiOBr grown inside and outside (BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4, BC). The hollow tubular structure realizes the full use of visible light by the multi&#8208;scattering effect of light. Large surface areas and more active sites for N2 adsorption and activation are present in the distinctive spatially dispersed hierarchical structures. Particularly, the quick separation and transfer of electrons and holes are facilitated by the sandwich tubular heterojunctions and tight contact interface of BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. The maximal NH3 generation rate of the BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 composite catalysts can reach 255.04 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, and it is 13.9 and 5.8 times that of pure BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides a novel method for designing and constructing unique heterojunctions for efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;negative homotropic allostery of a triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft with two guest binding sites was confirmed. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes showed that the trisporphyrin accommodated two guest molecules within the cleft via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. In solution,&#160;1H NMR and Job plots showed 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the binding constants and cooperativities. The guest binding of the trisporphyrin showed negative cooperativity and noncooperativity depending on the structures of the guest molecules. The correlations between the interaction parameters (&#945;) and Hill constants were determined. ITC experiments showed that the host&#8208;guest complexation of trisporphyrin with electron&#8208;deficient guests incurred an enthalpy penalty in the successive guest binding process. DFT calculations revealed that the first guest binding reduced the electron density of the central porphyrin plane, which led to an energetic penalty that weakened the successive binding process.</dc:description>

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the binding constants and cooperativities. The guest binding of the trisporphyrin showed negative cooperativity and noncooperativity depending on the structures of the guest molecules. The correlations between the interaction parameters (&#945;) and Hill constants were determined. ITC experiments showed that the host-guest complexation of trisporphyrin with electron-deficient guests incurred an enthalpy penalty in the successive guest binding process. DFT calculations revealed that the first guest binding reduced the electron density of the central porphyrin plane, which led to an energetic penalty that weakened the successive binding process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoluminescent Properties and Mechanism of Novel Cyanine&#8208;Borondifluoride Curcuminoid Hybrids as Red&#8208;to&#8208;Near Infrared and Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeting Dyes</title>

Seeing red: A series of cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been obtained as novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with ER self&#8208;targeting capability. Their photoluminescent properties and mechanism have been revealed.







Abstract
Synthesis&#8208;oriented design led us to the discovery of a series of novel cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes that overcome the intrinsic low synthetic yields of symmetrical cyanine&#8208;difluoroboronate (BF2)&#8208;hybridized NIR dyes. The hybridization endows NCR dyes with high molar extinction coefficients, efficient red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission, and enlarged Stokes shifts. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the asymmetrical layout of the three key electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating fragments results in a special pattern of partial charge separation and inconsistent degrees of charge delocalization on their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. While the nature of the hemicyanine fragment exerts significant influence on the excitation modes of NCR dyes, the borondifluoride hemicurcuminoid fragment is the major contributor to the enlarged Stokes shifts. Cell imaging experiments illustrated that a subtle change in the N&#8208;heterocycle of the hemicyanine fragment has a remarkable effect on the subcellular localization of NCR dyes. Unlike other previously reported cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized dyes, which mainly target mitochondria, the benzothiazole and indole&#8208;based NCR dyes accumulate in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets of HeLa cells, whereas the benzoxazole and quinoline&#8208;based NCR dyes stain the ER specifically.

         <title>A Novel Electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for Ultrasensitive Detection of Chloramphenicol: Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 was designed and synthesized for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM was achieved by Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 and its loading mechanism was investigated in theory and experiment.







Abstract
Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, the first electrode using highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol is proposed. The design of electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol is demonstrated by loading Pd onto HCMOFs. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM (64.6&#8197;pg/mL) was observed for these materials, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than the other reported materials for chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24&#8197;h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation determined the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2, revealing PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, which combine high conductivity and high catalytic activity, is of great advantage for ultrasensitive detection.

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;Perylene Charge Transfer Compounds; Sensitizers for Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Up&#8208;conversion</title>

BODIPY heterochromophores, unsymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions are prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC).







Abstract
BODIPY heterochromophores, asymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions were prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses show that the torsion angle between BODIPY and perylene units lie between 73.54 and 74.51, though they are not orthogonal. Both compounds show intense, charge transfer absorption and emission profiles, confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy and consistent with DFT calculations. The emission quantum yield was solvent dependent but the emission profile remained characteristic of CT transition across all solvents explored. Both BODIPY derivatives were found to be effective sensitizers of TTA&#8208;UC with perylene annihilator in dioxane and DMSO. Intense anti&#8208;Stokes emission was observed, and visible by eye from these solvents. Conversely, no TTA&#8208;UC was observed from the other solvents explored, including from non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene and hexane that yielded brightest fluorescence from the BODIPY derivatives. In dioxane, the power density plots obtained were strongly consistent with TTA&#8208;UC and the power density threshold, the Ith value (the photon flux at which 50&#8201;% of &#934;TTAUC is achieved), for B2PI was observed to be 2.5x lower than of B2P under optimal conditions, an effect ascribed to the combined influence of spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) and heavy metal on the triplet state formation for B2PI.

         <title>Mechanism and Origins of Site&#8208;Selectivity of Template&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Insertion of Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not so simple: Modern computational chemistry (DFT on reaction coordinates, extensive conformational searches, multiple means of treating entropy) has been used to probe the mechanism of a complex organometallic reaction &#8211; template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline &#8211; providing a deep dive into the origins of site selectivity and demonstrating that previous simple models are not sufficient.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline was interrogated by using computational quantum chemistry. An energetically viable mechanism for this complex multistep transformation was elucidated, with attention paid throughout to conformational flexibility and alternative ligand binding modes. The selectivity was found to correlate with distortion from a tetrahedral geometry for the carbon atom involved in C&#8722;H insertion, a parameter that can be applied to future template design.

         <title>Synthesis, Stepwise Bromination, and Functionalization of Picene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MCI building block: picene diimide (PiDI) was successfully synthesized. The PiDI derivative PiDI&#8208;CN4 exhibited excellent OFET performance with optimal electron mobility of 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Materials Synthesis and Processing Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diimides are indispensable candidates for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors in organic optoelectronic devices. Developing new PAH diimide building blocks are of remarkable significance for material diversity and further advance in organic semiconductors. In this contribution, 4,5,8,9&#8208;picene diimide (PiDI) was designed and synthesized. Controllable stepwise bromination of PiDI were accomplished to afford 13&#8208;monobromo&#8208;, 13,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;, 2,13,14&#8208;tribromo&#8208; and 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI. Moreover, cyanation of 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI gave the corresponding tetracyanated PiDI, which can be utilized as n&#8208;type semiconductor with OFET electron mobility up 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This result demonstrates the potential of PiDI as a building block for constructing new high&#8208;performance electronic&#8208;transporting materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials Synthesis and Processing Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diimides are indispensable candidates for n-type organic semiconductors in organic optoelectronic devices. Developing new PAH diimide building blocks are of remarkable significance for material diversity and further advance in organic semiconductors. In this contribution, 4,5,8,9-picene diimide (&lt;b&gt;PiDI&lt;/b&gt;) was designed and synthesized. Controllable stepwise bromination of &lt;b&gt;PiDI&lt;/b&gt; were accomplished to afford 13-monobromo-, 13,14-dibromo-, 2,13,14-tribromo- and 2,11,13,14-tetrabromo-PiDI. Moreover, cyanation of 2,11,13,14-tetrabromo-PiDI gave the corresponding tetracyanated PiDI, which can be utilized as n-type semiconductor with OFET electron mobility up 0.073&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This result demonstrates the potential of &lt;b&gt;PiDI&lt;/b&gt; as a building block for constructing new high-performance electronic-transporting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;triggered Disassembly of Organic Cationic Nanorods Produces a Cysteine Protease Mimic (Miravet et&#8197;al.)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triggered disassembly of nanorods produces an effective enzyme mimic, a process related to complex biological systems as cyclic AMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase. An insoluble cysteine protease mimic precursor is incorporated into soluble cationic rods in the presence of cationic surfactants. Reduction of the disulfide unit provokes rod disassembly and generation of a cysteine protease mimic, producing an extraordinary acceleration of PNPA hydrolysis.







Abstract
The emergence of catalytic activity associated with a disassembly process is reported, reminiscent of complex biological systems. A cystine derivative with pendant imidazole groups self&#8208;assembles into cationic nanorods in the presence of the cationic surfactants cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Disulfide reduction triggers nanorod disassembly and the generation of a simple cysteine protease mimic, which shows a dramatically improved catalytic efficiency in the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA).

         <title>An Intelligent Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy Based on Endogenous miRNA&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoplatform**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laser&#8208;free photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality for deep&#8208;seated tumor, yet is constrained by the low efficiency due to the limited stimulation strategies. Herein, a novel miRNA&#8208;responsive laser&#8208;free PDT was developed through metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;mediated chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) nanoplatform. The photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;loaded MOFs were functionalized with hairpin nucleic acids for sensitive responsiveness of tumor biomarker miRNA through catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), which enabled the amplified assembly of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mimicking hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzyme on MOFs. Simultaneously, the on&#8208;MOF assembled DNAzymes efficiently catalyzed chemiluminescence reaction to stimulate adjacent Ce6 in the presence of luminol and H2O2, thus allowing the CRET&#8208;mediated Ce6 luminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for self&#8208;illuminating PDT. The CRET nanoplatform achieved significant malignant cell apoptosis and tumor inhibition effects without external laser irradiation. It is envisioned that the microRNA&#8208;amplified CRET nanoplatform might be a selective and highly efficient antitumor nanomedicine for precise theranostic.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing demand for renewable energy, alkali metal&#8208;ion (lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion) batteries play more and more important roles in the field of static storage and electrical vehicle industry. Novel anode materials with high reversible capacity, safety and long&#8208;term cycling stability are desiderated to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries with high electrochemical performance. Antimony oxides (SbxOy) show electrochemical reaction activity with all of lithium, sodium and potassium, and are expected to be promising anode materials for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage due to their high theoretical capacities, appropriate operating potential and excellent safety properties. This review is devoted to overview the research progress on reaction mechanism and improvements in electrochemical performance of antimony oxides for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage, and look forward to their further prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidized Bridged Carbenoids as Viable Intermediates in a Fe(III) Catalyzed C&#8211;H Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe catalyzed carbene insertion reactions present an efficient route for direct C&#8211;H functionalization. The use of Fe(III) in place of the widely used Fe(II) presents several benefits. However, the mechanistic understanding of Fe(III) severely lags behind Fe(II) complexes. One of the major unsolved issues relates to the formation of bridged versus terminal metallocarbenes. Even though the oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes have been isolated and found to be thermodynamically more stable, they are generally considered a dead end for the catalytic cycle. In the current report, the formation and the subsequent reactions of the bridged carbenoid complexes for an Fe(TPP)Cl catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H insertion are investigated. Using DFT calculations, it is observed that both mono and bis oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes can participate in the catalytic cycle. Importantly, for the first time, a mechanistic pathway showing that these bridged species are not a dead end in Fe catalysis is presented. Their existence in other reactions might be more prevalent than what is currently believed. The current study will have important implications in utilizing Fe(III) complexes for other insertion reactions, especially for heme containing enzymes which necessarily need to be carried out under anaerobic/reducing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite for&#160;high&#8208;performance potassium ion battery anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnS&#160;has acquired increasing attention for high&#8208;performance PIBs anode because of its remarkable theoretical capacity, and redox reversibility for conversion reaction. However, the larger volume variation and delayed reaction kinetics for the ZnS&#160;in the discharge/charge&#160;processes lead to pulverization and severe capacity degradation.&#160;Herein, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIB) anode, ZnS@C composite exhibits good rate performance and long life (stable reversible capacity of 107.8 mAh/g over 2000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 5 A/g and high reversible capacity of 310 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer. This method of synthesizing trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite provides an important strategy for obtaining potassium ion batteries anode with long cycle.</dc:description>

In this work, we prepare a kind of highly efficient wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL free&#8208;standing films by responsive chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission mesogen. Firstly, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene monomer (MPy) is designed and synthesized.

Finally, this wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL film with both fluorescence and CPL modes is successfully applied in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. This work provides a simple way to construct CPL apparatus with adjustable luminescence wavelength and high glum.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic approach to two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron extended [1,4]thiaborins anellated with two benzothiophene units was developed. Obtained boracycles exhibit different electronic properties of the central thiaborin ring reflected in their different aromatic characters, boron Lewis acidity and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic behavior. Thiaborins were converted to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes. Their emission spectra exhibit two distinct bands resulting from 1LE and 1CT transitions. Strong near infrared phosphorescence in Zeonex thin films at 77 K indicates efficient intersystem crossing and formation of triplet states. Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates the electron transfer to a 1CT state followed by a transition to the 3LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of spiro thiaborin&#8208;BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5 h with only 0.05% mol catalyst load.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2)&#8208;Cyclization reactions of unsaturated phosphonites with aldehydes and thioketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By exploiting the unique reactivity of ethynyl&#8208;phosphonites we obtain novel P(V)&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles via (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or cycloaliphatic thioketones in satisfactory to excellent yields. Whereas reactions with thioketones to yield 1,3&#8208;thiaphospholes&#8208;3&#8208;oxides occur smoothly at room temperature with equimolar amounts of the starting materials in absence of any catalyst, the analogous conversions with aldehydes to generate 3&#8208;oxides of 1,3&#8208;oxaphospholes require addition of triethylamine as a base. We postulate a step&#8208;wise (3+2)&#8208;cyclization mechanism for the formation of the 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole ring based on DFT quantum chemical calculations. With this study, we introduce new cyclization reactions originating from unsaturated phosphonites as central synthetic building blocks to yield previously inaccessible stable phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles with unexplored potential for the molecular sciences.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Regioselective di&#8208;functionalization of a cyclodextrin allows hydrophobic domains to be directed in a geometrically controlled manner. This controlled orientation ultimately gives access to an original hierarchical assembly in the solid state.

         <title>Redox reporter &#8211; ligand competition to support signaling in the cocaine&#8208;binding electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) biosensors have demonstrated capabilities in monitoring molecules directly in undiluted complex matrices and in the body with the hopes of addressing personalized medicine challenges. This sensing platform relies on an electrode&#8208;bound, redox&#8208;reporter&#8208;modified aptamer. The electrochemical signal is thought to originate from the aptamer undergoing a binding&#8208;induced conformational change capable of moving the redox reporter closer to the electrode surface. While this is the generally accepted mechanism, it is notable that there is limited evidence demonstrating conformational change or distance&#8208;dependent change in electron transfer rates in E&#8208;AB sensors. In response, we investigate here the signal transduction of the well&#8208;studied cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer with different analytical methods and found that this sensor relies on a redox&#8208;reporter &#8211; ligand competition mechanism rather than a ligand&#8208;induced structure formation mechanism. Our results show that the covalently bound redox reporter, methylene blue, binds at or near the ligand binding site on the aptamer resulting in a folded conformation of the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer. Addition of ligand then competes with the redox reporter for binding, altering its electron transfer rate. While we show this for the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer, given the prevalence of methylene blue in E&#8208;AB sensors, a similar competition&#8208;based may occur in other systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Artificial Photosynthetic Models in Water Using &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Conjugated Phthalocyanines as Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two water&#8208;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four permethylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#160;(&#946;&#8208;CD)&#160;moieties at the &#945; positions&#160;have been utilized as building blocks for the construction of artificial photosynthetic models in water. The hydrophilic and bulky &#946;&#8208;CD moieties not only can increase the water solubility of the phthalocyanine core and prevent its stacking in water but can also bind with a tetrasulfonated zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnTPPS) and/or sodium 2&#8208;anthraquinonesulfonate (AQ) in water through host&#8208;guest interactions. The binding interactions of these species have been studied spectroscopically, while the photoinduced processes of the resulting complexes have been investigated using&#160;steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. In the ternary complexes,&#160;the ZnTPPS units serve as light&#8208;harvesting antennas to capture the light energy and transfer it to the&#160;phthalocyanine core via efficient excitation energy transfer.&#160;The excited phthalocyanine is&#160;subsequently&#160;quenched&#160;by the electron&#8208;deficient&#160;AQ&#160;units&#160;through electron transfer.&#160;Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy provides clear evidence for the singlet&#8208;singlet energy transferfrom the photo&#8208;excited ZnTPPS to&#160;the&#160;phthalocyanine&#160;core with a rate constant (kENT)&#160;in the order of&#160;109&#160;s&#8208;1.&#160;Thepopulation of phthalocyanine radical cations indicates the occurrence of electron transfer from the excited phthalocyanine to the AQ moieties, forming a charge&#8208;separated state.</dc:description>

In the ternary complexes,&#160;the ZnTPPS units serve as light-harvesting antennas to capture the light energy and transfer it to the&#160;phthalocyanine core via efficient excitation energy transfer.&#160;The excited phthalocyanine is&#160;subsequently&#160;quenched&#160;by the electron-deficient&#160;AQ&#160;units&#160;through electron transfer.&#160;Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy provides clear evidence for the singlet-singlet energy transferfrom the photo-excited ZnTPPS to&#160;the&#160;phthalocyanine&#160;core with a rate constant (kENT)&#160;in the order of&#160;109&#160;s-1.&#160;Thepopulation of phthalocyanine radical cations indicates the occurrence of electron transfer from the excited phthalocyanine to the AQ moieties, forming a charge-separated state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rationalizing the Extent of the &#8220;Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers&#8221; Effect in Supramolecular Helical Catalysts: Effect of Copper Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lower optical purities of supramolecular helical catalysts embedding a low fraction of &#8220;sergeants&#8221; is due to the aggregation of single helices through copper crosslinks.[MR1]&#160;







Abstract
Aggregation of supramolecular helices, for example through interdigitation of their alkyl side chains or through more directional supramolecular interactions, leads to hierarchical architectures with original structural and chiroptical properties. However, when a chiral monomer (the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;) is introduced as a minor component in these assemblies composed of a majority of achiral monomers (the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;), it is not clear how the aggregation changes the ability of the sergeant to induce a preferential helicity to the polymer main chain (the so&#8208;called &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect). This study reports a detailed investigation of the influence of [Cu(OAc)2&#8901;H2O] coordination on the structure and chiroptical properties of helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;assemblies composed of a catalytically&#8208;active benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, acting as the &#8220;soldier&#8221;, and an enantiopure BTA monomer derived from cyclohexylalanine, playing the role of the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;. The copper actually significantly influences the extent of the &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect since it acts as a crosslink that induces some chiral defects in the supramolecular helices. These crosslinks appear to be preserved during the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4&#8208;nitroacetophenone. The aggregation of helices through the formation of copper crosslinks is reversible since homochiral single helices are exclusively formed in the case of sergeant&#8208;rich assemblies. The fact that both main chain and side chain aggregation affects the chiroptical properties of supramolecular helices must be considered in the design of elaborated chiral materials.

         <dc:description>
We have reported discovered pentafluorophenol to be an effective catalyst for the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, which synthesizes to synthesize (spirocyclic) tetrahydro &#946; carbolines. This simple catalytic methodology uses features mild conditions to generate high yields of indole alkaloids to produce indole alkaloids in high yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This strategy demonstrates a practical approach for synthesizing to the synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine on a gram&#8208;scale, as well as the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed pentafluorophenol as an operative catalyst for synthesizing (spirocyclic) tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This straightforward catalytic protocol works under mild conditions resulting indole alkaloids in excellent yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This transformation demonstrates a practical and adaptable approach to produce a highly effective gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine and enables the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Luminescence of Chemically and Physically Mixed Europium and Terbium Phosphonates: Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescence, Near&#8208;White&#8208;Light Emission, and Selective Fe3+ Detection</title>

Color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials: Homonuclear EuP and TbP as well as chemically and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonates exhibit color&#8208;tunable luminescence even near white&#8208;light emission, among which TbP is further used for Fe3+ detection.







Abstract
Molecular lanthanide phosphonates [Ln2(H3tpmm)2(H2O)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (Ln=Eu, EuP; Ln=Tb, TbP) were synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed that EuP has a sandwich&#8208;like dinuclear structure, in which the Eu(III) center adopts a {EuO8} distorted dodecahedral geometry. XRPD patterns prove that TbP and EuP are isomorphous and isostructural. EuP and TbP are highly thermally stable approaching 450&#8201;&#176;C and exhibit red&#8208; and green&#8208;light emissions from the characteristic 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transition of the Eu3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, luminescence modulation is achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb2&#8211;xP (x=1.5, 1, 0.5), and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate materials, p&#8208;yEuP&#8201;:&#8201;zTbP (y&#8201;:&#8201;z=3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;3), with varying the excitation wavelength. Of particular note, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is also achieved for c&#8208;EuTbP, p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;TbP, and p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;3TbP when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Therefore, these dinuclear molecular lanthanide phosphonates emitting excitation wavelength and Eu3+&#8201;:&#8201;Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence might be potential candidates for color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials. On the other hand, the bright green&#8208;light emission makes TbP to be an excellent reusable luminescence sensor for selective detection of Fe3+ with Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching constant (KSV) of 9.66&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and detection limit (DL) of 0.42&#8197;&#956;M through absorption competition caused luminescence quenching effect.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;Excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dealkenylative Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, have been achieved on olefin&#8208;containing substrates in a one&#8208;pot and highly modular fashion.







Abstract
A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.

&lt;p&gt;Dealkenylative Giese-type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci-type alkylation, copper-catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, have been achieved on olefin-containing substrates in a one-pot and highly modular fashion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin-containing substrates has been developed through the one-pot formation and utilization of pro-aromatic 1,4-dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4-dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon-carbon and carbon-hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese-type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci-type alkylation, copper-catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stereospecific On&#8208;Surface Dimerization into Bishelicenes: Topochemical Ullmann Coupling of Bromohelicene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only same handedness please! On&#8208;surface Ullmann C&#8722;C coupling of bromohelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically only to homochiral combinations into bis(helicene).







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface dimerization into bis(hexahelicene) on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry. C&#8722;C Ullmann coupling of (rac)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;hexahelicene leads to formation of the (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;diastereomers of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(hexahelicene), whilst formation of the (M,P)&#8208;diastereomer is not observed. Upon cooling, the bis(hexahelicene) aggregates into an ordered two&#8208;dimensional lattice with partly randomly distributed enantiomers. The highly specific diastereomeric coupling is explained by the surface alignment of educt in combination with the strong steric overcrowding in a possible surface&#8208;confined (M,P)&#8208;product.

         <title>Controlling Morphologies of Redox&#8208;responsive Polymeric Nanocarriers for a Smart Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;responsive nanocarriers using disulfides or thiols have received considerable attention owing to the higher levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells than those in extracellular fluids. Nevertheless, the normal&#8208;to&#8208;cancer&#8208;cell selectivity of these nanocarriers has not yet been clarified. Nanocarriers exhibit different cytotoxicities depending on the morphologies they adopt under the redox&#8208;active conditions typically existing in cancerous cells. Therefore, not only GSH levels but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and other complex cancerous cell conditions must be considered for the development of smart drug delivery systems. In this article, we describe the structural design of redox&#8208;responsive polymers that exhibit different morphological changes in environments akin to cancerous cells (e.g., GSH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;abundant conditions). In addition, we propose a molecular design for the spatiotemporal control of nanocarrier morphology depending on the levels of both GSH and ROS upon photoirradiation to increase the cytotoxicity difference between normal and cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Properties of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Influenced by the Tether Length of Reagents with Two Reactive Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is an effective method for controlling a local band gap, resulting in photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, SWNTs were functionalized using a series of bromoalkanes and dibromoalkanes to evaluate the effects of their length on the nanotube PL properties. When bromoalkanes (CnH2n+1Br) or dibromoalkanes (CnH2nBr2) with tether lengths of six or more were utilized for six different semiconducting SWNTs, the obtained SWNT adducts exhibited two new PL peaks, whereas dibromoalkanes with tether lengths of 3&#8211;5 (CnH2nBr2: n = 3&#8211;5) produced single peaks. Combined with theoretical calculations, the results suggested that the tether length of reagents changes the formation mechanism of functionalized adducts, that is, CnH2nBr2&#160;(n = 3&#8211;5) tends to result in kinetic products.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiosensitive compounds can be useful for the detection of radiations and also as prodrugs that can be activated during a radiotherapy. Herein we describe the use of benzothiazolines, which upon treatment with 137Cs produced &#947;&#8208;irradiation in water give rise to fluorescent benzothiazoles and concomitant release of amines or carboxylic acids. In a proof of concept study, we showed that benzothiazolines may be used as new cleavable linkers that can be triggered upon irradiation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Our quantum chemical analyses elucidate how the replacement of O in the amide bonds of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;5&#8208;tricarboxamides (OBTAs) for the larger chalcogens S and Se enhances the intermolecular interactions and thereby the stability of the obtained hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers by two unexpected mechanisms: i) the SBTA and SeBTA monomers have a better geometry for self&#8208;assembly and ii) induce stronger covalent (hydrogen&#8208;bond) interactions besides enhanced dispersion interactions. In addition, we show that the cooperativity in BTA self&#8208;assembly is caused by charge separation&#160;in the &#963;&#8208;electronic system following the covalency in the hydrogen bonds.</dc:description>
