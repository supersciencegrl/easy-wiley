         <title>Design and Evaluation of Bivalent K&#8208;Ras Inhibitors That Target the CAAX Binding Site and the Acidic Surface of Farnesyltransferase and Geranylgeranyltransferase I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical inhibition of K&#8208;Ras posttranslational prenylation represents a promising strategy against aggressive cancers. A structure&#8208;based design produces piperidine&#8208;based peptidomimetics conjugated to cationic modules, effectively inhibiting FTase and GGTase I at single&#8208;digit nanomolar concentrations. This dual&#8208;targeting approach demonstrates promise for treating K&#8208;Ras&#8208;driven cancers.








Abstract
Mutant K&#8208;Ras drives cancer through its membrane localization, which requires posttranslational modification by farnesyltransferase (FTase). FTase attaches farnesyl to the K&#8208;Ras C&#8208;terminal CVIM tetrapeptide, enabling membrane binding. However, K&#8208;Ras can also undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation by geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), making FTase inhibition alone ineffective. Dual inhibition of FTase and GGTase I is necessary to fully block K&#8208;Ras localization and its cancer activity. We developed bivalent inhibitors targeting both FTase and GGTase I by binding to the CVIM (C = cysteine, V = valine, I = isoleucine, M = methionine) site and an adjacent acidic surface. A nonthiol CVIM peptidomimetic based on a piperidine scaffold showed potent FTase inhibition (Ki = 2.1&#160;nM) with less effect on GGTase I (Ki = 210&#160;nM). Adding cationic modules to this compound produced dual inhibitors with enhanced potency (Ki = 2&#8211;5&#160;nM), significantly improving upon previous agents. These bivalent inhibitors effectively reduced mutant K&#8208;Ras cancer cell viability and inhibited K&#8208;Ras farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in cells. This dual&#8208;targeting approach shows promise for treating K&#8208;Ras&#8208;driven cancers.

A structure-based design produces piperidine-based peptidomimetics conjugated to cationic modules, effectively inhibiting FTase and GGTase I at single-digit nanomolar concentrations.

         <title>Negative Cooperativity in the UHRF1 TTD&#8208;PHD Dual Domain Masks the Contributions of Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions Between Trimethyllysine and the TTD Aromatic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the comparative interaction of the UHRF1 TTD or dual domain (TTD&#8208;PHD) with a histone 3 tail containing trimethyllysine, Kme3, or its neutral isostere. We show that the TTD alone binds K9me3 via electrostatically tunable cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, whereas with the TTD&#8208;PHD, binding of R2 to the PHD dominates, demonstrating negative cooperativity and masking the electrostatic tunability of K9me3 binding.








Abstract
UHRF1 is a promising epigenetic target in oncology, but inhibitor development has proven challenging due to the interplay between its tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and plant homeodomain (PHD). The TTD binds trimethyllysine (Kme3) at position 9 while the PHD binds Arg at position 2 on histone 3. Herein, we report how the PHD influences TTD recognition of the histone 3 tail containing Kme3 (H3K9me3) versus its neutral isostere, tert&#8208;butyl norleucine (tBuNle). Our findings show that the dual domain binds both peptides equally, supporting tBuNle's potential for inhibitor development. However, unexpectedly, the binding mechanism of H3K9me3 differs between the single and dual domains. In the TTD alone, Kme3 is bound in the aromatic cage via electrostatically tunable cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, but in the dual domain, Kme3 binding is independent of electrostatics in the aromatic cage&#8212;an unprecedented observation. Computational studies suggest cation&#8208;&#960; interactions should contribute in both cases. The contrasting experimental and computational results point to an unusual example of negative chelate cooperativity: interactions between the histone and PHD mask the mechanism of TTD recognition of K9me3. This work underscores the complexity of histone post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) readout in multi&#8208;domain proteins and demonstrates the first example of a masked cation&#8208;&#960; interaction.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Annulation of Benzoxazinones: An Easy Access to Dihydroisoquinoline Benzamide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed, substrate&#8208;controlled, site&#8208;selective one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported for the synthesis of biologically active 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives. The method involves the three&#8208;component coupling of benzoxazinones, amines, and diaryl/dialkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes yielding the corresponding products with high efficiency. It also enables the synthesis of various dihydroisoquinoline benzamide derivatives with chemo&#8208;selectivity.








Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted substrate&#8208;controlled, site&#8208;selective, one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component cascade dehydrogenative annulation reaction is reported here. The developed methodology leads to the synthesis of biologically active 4H&#8208;benzo[d] [1,3] oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives by the nucleophilic addition of amines to benzoxazinones followed by coupling with diphenyl acetylenes. In addition to providing excellent yields of products, the method is also regioselective. This new protocol has been demonstrated to have an easy access to a variety of dihydroisoquinoline benzamide derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Copper(I) Complexes with Weakly Basic, Fluorinated, and Multicyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak Coordination, High Potentials: Making use of the weakly coordinated copper(I)&#8208;dinitrogen complex [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF&#160;=&#160;C(CF3)3) as a precursor, homoleptic Cu(I)&#8208;arene complexes with weakly basic (fluorinated) arene ligands were synthesized. The higher the degree of fluorination of the arenes, the weaker are their interaction with Cu(I) and the higher are their Cu+/Cu redox potentials reaching +1.5&#160;V versus Fc+/Fc in pentafluorobenzene.








Abstract
The dinitrogen complex [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF&#160;=&#160;C(CF3)3) acts as the precursor for the synthesis of homoleptic, weakly bound Cu(I)&#8208;arene complexes with benzene, fluorinated, and multicyclic arenes. Upon dissolution of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] in benzene or the fluorinated arenes xFB (x&#160;=&#160;number of fluorine atoms, x&#160;=&#160;1&#8722;4), the complexes [Cu(C6H6)2&#8722;3]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, [Cu(xFB)2&#8722;3]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (x&#160;=&#160;1&#8722;3), or the ion pair [(xFB)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (x&#160;=&#160;4) form. Both the benzene and fluorobenzene complexes are also available in larger scales by oxidation of elemental copper in the respective solvents using [NO]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; as an oxidant. A higher degree of fluorination of the arene ligand leads to a weaker coordination of the Cu(I) atom and thus to higher Cu+/Cu redox potentials in solution that reach an unprecedentedly high value of +1.5&#160;V (!) versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple in pentafluorobenzene. The versatile applicability of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] as a &#8220;naked&#8221; Cu(I) source is demonstrated by complexation reactions with the multicyclic arenes anthracene and hexaphenylbenzene that yielded multiply charged cations. All complexes presented in this work were characterized by their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structures.

A higher degree of fluorination of the arene ligand leads to a weaker coordination of the Cu(I) atom and thus to higher Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu redox potentials in solution that reach an unprecedentedly high value of +1.5&#160;V (!) versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple in pentafluorobenzene. The versatile applicability of [(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Cu{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}] as a &#8220;naked&#8221; Cu(I) source is demonstrated by complexation reactions with the multicyclic arenes anthracene and hexaphenylbenzene that yielded multiply charged cations. All complexes presented in this work were characterized by their single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Meta C&#9472;H Bond Olefination of Anilides</title>

         <dc:description>
A Copper&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H olefination of pivanilides with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl iodonium salts was achieved using a weakly coordinated directing group (DG). The involvement of a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state was plausibly critical in ensuring the challenging meta selectivity.








Abstract
Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;olefination of anilides using alkenyl iodonium salts. The olefination of a panel of pivanilides was achieved using an additive&#8208;free copper&#8208;based catalytic system under mild reaction conditions (25 examples, up to 60% yield). By favoring a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state, the approach demonstrated an excellent regioselectivity for the meta C&#9472;H functionalization with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl groups using a weakly coordinated directing group (DG). Postfunctionalization reactions were conducted, highlighting both the synthetic interest of the products and the potential atom&#8208;efficiency of the process.

         <title>Multistate Dihydroazulene&#8208;Spiropyran Dyads: Path&#8208;Dependent Switchings and Refinement of the &#8220;Meta&#8208;rule&#8221; of Photoactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Dihydroazulene&#8208;spiropyran (DHA&#8208;SP) photochromic dyads were prepared and investigated by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. By comparing the overall properties, including dynamics of photoswitching, to those of monomeric units, the dyads satisfy the so&#8208;called &#8220;meta&#8208;rule&#8221;. The dyads can reach eight different states, some only by a specific sequence of stimuli, here represented by a finite&#8208;state&#8208;machine diagram&#8212;this path&#8208;dependent switching adds an additional degree of data storage.








Abstract
Multistate switches are interesting systems for a plethora of potential applications, such as for data storage involving many different states or for logic operations characterized by specific outputs. The main challenge is to achieve a precise control of accessibility to a specific state via a given sequence of multiple stimuli. Here, we have connected dihydroazulene (DHA) and spiropyran (SP) photoswitches in dyads to elucidate differences in optical and switching properties between ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged dyads. Dyads were prepared by Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions and photoisomerizations studied in detail by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. Moreover, the kinetics of thermal back&#8208;reactions of meta&#8208;stable states were studied. The results show path&#8208;dependent switchings of the dyads using light in combination with other stimuli (acid/base/heat), allowing access to eight distinct states. The accessibility to some specific states via only one sequence of external stimuli provides an additional degree of data storage&#8212;information is not only stored as the state itself but also as the unique sequence of stimuli required to reach this state. By changing the bridging unit between the photoswitches, various properties (outputs) were finely tuned such as absorption and fluorescence behaviors, lifetime of meta&#8208;stable state, and photoisomerization dynamics.

         <title>Bis(10&#8208;oxacorrole) with Fused Pyridine as a Linker: Synthesis, Structure, and Interaction between the Subunits in the Neutral, Mono&#8208;, and Dicationic States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of aromatic pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole) nickel(II) complexes was obtained starting from antiaromatic norcorrolatonickel(II). Interaction between the subunits of the dimer allowed observation of four&#8208;step oxidation, giving rise to strong absorptions in the NIR region.








Abstract
Pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole)s are obtained by a Hantzsch&#8208;type cyclization using arylaldehydes and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;oxacorrole. Spectroscopic characteristics, corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicate aromaticity of the dimer and strong interaction between the subunits. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical analyses indicate facile access to cation radicals and dicationic species. The oxidized forms are characterized by electronic and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopies as well as by DFT calculations. Monocations give rise to strong absorption bands in the near infra&#8208;red (NIR) region between 1500 and 2500&#160;nm, while dications are characterized by a series of absorptions between 1000 and 2200&#160;nm. ESR and variable temperature (VT) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments indicate the presence of singlet&#8208;triplet spin equilibria for the solution of the dication. For the dication of bis(oxacorrole) in the singlet ground state, neither aromaticity nor antiaromaticity has been detected by low&#8208;temperature 1H NMR and gauge independent atomic orbital (GIAO) calculations despite delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanochannels: Suprasome&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Ionophore to Regulate Transmembrane Zn2+&#160;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivatives that generate nanochannels within the lipid bilayers for the selective transmembrane transport of Zn2&#8314; ions. These transporters were delivered to bacterial cells using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based suprasome assemblies, activated by Zn2&#8314;&#8208;induced disassembly. The disruption in ionic homeostasis generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the death of Gram&#8208;positive Gram&#8208;negative and drug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
The development of synthetic ion channels and stimuli&#8208;responsive suprasomes represents two crucial yet largely disconnected areas of supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we demonstrated that suprasomes can effectively deliver hydrophobic synthetic ion transporters to lipid membranes, regulating physiologically significant transition metal ions and subsequently modulating activity within lipid&#8208;bound compartments. We showed that a potent bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivative self&#8208;assembles within the lipid bilayer to form a supramolecular nanochannel, which facilitates selective and efficient transport of Zn2+ ions from the external aqueous solution across the lipid bilayer and into the internal solution of large unilamellar vesicles via an electrogenic pathway. The hydrophobic ion transporter could also be delivered to lipid bilayers due to its inherent ability to form suprasomal assembly with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) through dynamic host&#8211;guest interactions. The Zn2&#8314; ions serve as stimuli to disassemble the suprasomes and release the ion transporter, which further penetrates the bilayers of lipid vesicles and regulates transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport. The application of this strategy of stimuli&#8208;mediated delivery of synthetic ion transporters to regulate transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport showed antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive, Gram&#8208;negative, and drug&#8208;resistant bacterial cells.

A visible light&#8211;driven [2+2+1] bicyclization of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes and alkyl bromides, catalyzed by 3DPA2FBN and 2,6&#8208;lutidine and mediated by iminyl radicals, has been established. This metal&#8208;free, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical, eco&#8208;friendly method is performed under mild conditions, yielding a series of pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine derivatives.

Abstract
A visible light&#8211;promoted cascade [2+2+1] bicyclization reaction of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes and activated alkyl bromides has been successfully established. This reaction exhibits mild conditions, metal&#8208;free characteristics, and excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy, along with environmental friendliness. It demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, underscoring its potential for practical applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process and a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by an iminyl radical.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Mononucleotide Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;responsive mononucleotide coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions via azobenzene photoisomerization. Coacervates with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV light, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling nucleotide release. This minimal system highlights the potential role of light for exploring energy&#8208;driven phase separation in de novo protocells.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the formation of biomolecular condensates in modern cells and is also explored as a mechanism for assembling protocells. Phase&#8208;separated droplets provide dynamic micro&#8208;environments that concentrate reactants, enhance reactions, and allow molecular exchange, essential for both cellular regulation, and adaptive compartmentalization. While modern cells achieve dynamic LLPS through enzymatic and metabolic pathways, protocells may be designed to harness external stimuli such as pH, temperature, redox potential, or light. However, existing studies of light&#8208;responsive coacervates rely on complex biomolecules, limiting their use as minimal platforms of energy&#8208;driven phase separation. Here, we develop a minimal system of light&#8208;responsive coacervates composed of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight species: mononucleotides and azobenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles with varying charge valency. These coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions through azobenzene photoisomerization, with their behavior governed by charge valency and nucleotide structure. We demonstrate that coacervates formed with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV irradiation but exhibit significant property changes, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling light&#8208;controlled nucleotide release. Additionally, we achieved hierarchical droplet organization and light&#8208;actuated biomolecular localization within multiphase systems. Overall, these findings establish a minimal platform for designing light&#8208;responsive synthetic protocells, providing insights into dynamic compartmentalization in de novo life&#8208;like systems.

         <title>S&#8208;Heterocyclic s&#8208;Indacenodifluorene: Synthesis, Properties, and Thermally Tunable Ambipolar Field&#8208;Effect Mobility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unveiled the thermally tunable nature of charge carriers from p&#8208;type to balanced ambipolar to n&#8208;type charge transport for a heterocyclic s&#8208;indacenodifluorene derivative comprising antiaromatic S&#8208;heterocyclic as&#8208;indacene unit in the &#960;&#8208;backbone.








Abstract
Design of semiconducting materials with facile control of charge transport and the nature of charge carriers is essential for realizing niche applications with organic electronics. Described herein are the synthesis, crystal structure, and analysis of the electronic properties of a four&#8208;stage redox amphoteric S&#8208;heterocyclic s&#8208;indacenodifluorene 6, including the study of its ambipolar charge carrier mobility (&#181;h and &#181;e) in organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices. Despite being electron&#8208;rich, our investigation revealed reversible reduction potentials for 6 in the cyclic voltammetry, which is attributed to the recovery of locally aromatic thiophene and cyclopentadienyl anion units upon electron injection for the two antiaromatic S&#8208;heterocyclic as&#8208;indacene units in accordance with the Glidewell&#8208;Lloyd rule of aromaticity. In line with this, we observed an interesting thermal tunability of the nature of charge carriers from p&#8208;type to balanced ambipolar to n&#8208;type charge transport with reasonable semiconductor mobility in all regimes of transport. This behavior is correlated with the modification of the transport levels upon annealing of the semiconductor and possible increase in the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization with increasing temperature. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept tunability of the nature of charge transport indicates the efficacy of our molecular design.

         <title>Multi&#8208;site CuZn alloy boosts nitrate reduction to ammonia via optimized intermediate adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an effective way to solve nitrate pollution and a promising strategy for ammonia (NH3) synthesis under the ambient temperature and pressure. However, NO3RR is still hindered by the lack of efficient catalysts and an understanding of mechanisms that enhance the catalytic performance. Herein, we propose intermetallic alloying as a promising strategy to optimize NO3RR reaction pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of intermediates, as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations comparing NO3RR performance of Cu (111) and CuZn (110) surfaces. In CuZn alloy, the electron&#8208;donating property of Cu weakens the adsorption of NOx (x = 1, 2, and 3) intermediates, while the electron&#8208;accepting property of Zn strengthens the binding of NOxH intermediates, thus lowering the protonation reaction energy. Zn sites preferentially promote the removal of O species, while Cu sites dominate the protonation of N species. This synergistic effect enables CuZn (110) surface to successfully break the undesirable scaling relationship in traditional metal catalysts, resulting in excellent catalytic activity for NO3RR, with an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of &#8722;0.28 V. This work provides valuable insights and theoretical guidance for NO3RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating Ligand Tailoring and Cation Incorporation as Strategies for Tuning Heterobimetallic Cerium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes featuring metals with high coordination numbers by incorporation of secondary redox&#8208;inactive cations has received far less attention than it deserves.&#160; Here, appending moderate steric bulk to a tripodal ligand framework has been tested for its influence on secondary&#8208;cation&#8208;driven structural and electrochemical tuning of cerium, a lanthanide that tends to adopt high coordination numbers. A quasi&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric cerium(III) complex denoted [Ce] has been prepared that features pendant benzyloxy groups, and this work demonstrates that this species offers a site capable of binding of single Na+ or Ca2+ ions. Electrochemical and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies reveal equilibrium binding affinity of [Ce] for Na+ in acetonitrile solvent, contrasting with tight binding of all cations in all other previously studied systems of this type. The modulated cation binding can be attributed to the bulky benzyloxy groups, which impact the thermodynamics of cation binding but do not impede formation of cerium centers with coordination number 8 upon binding of either Na+ or Ca2+. The Ce(IV/III) reduction potential was found to be tunable under the equilibrium binding conditions, highlighting the potentially significant role that controlled structural changes can play in modulating the solution properties of heterobimetallic complexes.</dc:description>

Recent developments in molecular design, self&#8208;assembly strategies, and applications of naphthalimides were discussed. This review offers insights into the utilization of naphthalimides&#8208;based materials for technological advancements.








Abstract
Naphthalimide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled materials have gained significant attention in recent years because of their exceptional versatility and wide range of applications, from sensors and electronics to biomedical. Naphthalimides derivatives, with ease of functionalization and robust photophysical properties, became an ideal platform for creating highly ordered self&#8208;assembled architectures with tailored functionalities. This review provides an overall understanding of the recent developments in the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of naphthalimide&#8208;based materials, focusing on how self&#8208;assembly enhances their performance in various applications. The review examines the role of self&#8208;assembly in improving these materials&#8217; optical, mechanical, and electronic properties, highlighting their use in sensors for detecting gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and amines. Furthermore, the integration of self&#8208;assembled naphthalimides in light&#8208;emitting devices, energy&#8208;harvesting systems, and fluorescence&#8208;based imaging demonstrates their potential in both electronic and biological applications. By analyzing recent developments in molecular design, self&#8208;assembly strategies, and applications, this review aims to offer insights into how these materials can be optimized for future technological advancements.

         <title>A Reversible Nitroamino&#8208;Based Switch Modulates Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising nitroamino&#8208;based switch has been introduced into energetic compounds that can effectively coordinate twin crystals induced by hydrogen&#8208;bonding competition, thereby leading to explosives with excellent overall performance as a result of constrained planarity. This nitroamino&#8208;based switching is also expected to have applications in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#160;self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in molecular switches is critical for adaptive materials. However, most of the reported molecular switches are not capable of modulating hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in energetic materials, limiting high&#8208;demand applications in explosives. In this work, the first high&#8208;energy nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch is reported. It can control the complex hydrogen&#8208;bonding systems of energetic materials by reversible cycling for property modulation. Through alkali&#8208;acid stimulation, the nitroamino&#8208;based switch undergoes dynamic transitions, which reconfigure H&#8208;bond networks and separate twin crystals (in x&#8208;ray verification). Supported by crystallography and theoretical modeling (e.g., the density of states), this switching mechanism modulates molecular planarity (&#916;&#952;&#160;&gt;&#160;60&#176;) and optimizes the energy&#8208;stability balance, obtaining a compound 6&#8208;&#946; with comprehensive properties comparable to classical explosives (e.g., RDX and HMX). By linking hydrogen&#8208;bonding engineering and energetic materials science through the nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch, it facilitates superior energetic compounds that can be applied to defense equipment. In addition, our work establishes the nitroamino&#8208;based switch as a generalized tool for molecular engineering, bridging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding control and self&#8208;assembly materials design.

         <title>Exploiting a New Strategy to Prepare Water&#8208;Soluble Heteroleptic Iridium(III) Complexes to Control Electrochemiluminescence Reaction Pathways in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble luminophores prepared by sulfonation of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes enable judicious tailoring of properties for unprecedented control of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction pathways in aqueous solution. This approach removes a longstanding barrier to the translation of high&#8208;efficiency and multicolored ECL systems developed in organic solvents to the aqueous conditions desired for many analytical applications.








Abstract
The direct derivatization of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes with sulfonate groups removes the limitations of prior strategies for the preparation of water&#8208;soluble analogues, in which complexes were prepared from a narrow range of ligands with suitably polar or charged functional groups. Phenylpyridine, phenylpyrazole, and phenylbenzothiazole ligands were selectively sulfonated opposite to their cyclometalated carbon within iridium(III) complexes containing bipyridine or N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ancillary ligands. Altering reaction conditions enabled additional sulfonation of the benzothiazole fragments. Informed by the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the parent complexes in organic solvents, we adopted this strategy to design six novel luminophores that proceeded through three different sets of coreactant electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction pathways under aqueous conditions. The intensity of the indirect coreactant ECL of one of the iridium(III) luminophores was enhanced by over an order of magnitude by introducing a redox mediator, extending this promising analytical approach beyond the conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+ electrochemiluminophore.

         <title>Simple Large&#8208;Scale Preparation of Carbon Dot Composites with High Luminescent Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study describes the large&#8208;scale preparation of carbon dot composites. These composites have high deep blue fluorescence quantum yield and long green phosphorescence which can be used as deep blue LEDs and advanced digital encryption. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of the structures of the composites are proposed.








Abstract
At present, the demand for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective luminescent materials has increasingly grown and carbon dots (CDs) stand out due to their distinctive advantages. However, their preparation and purification process are too complex to commercialize. Issues such as fluorescence quenching, low quantum yield of short&#8208;wavelength emission, and short room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence lifetimes still need to be addressed. Here, we successfully prepared CD composites on a large scale for the applications of deep&#8208;blue LEDs and phosphorescent encryption through the combination of several easy, controllable, and repeatable strategies. Their luminescent properties are similar to the precursor and the luminescent performance are more excellent, achieving a fluorescence quantum yield of 65.46% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1489.2&#160;ms. Through various characterizations, it was found that ammonia, polar groups, and urea content affect the whole crystallization process of matrix. We put forward that surface free energy leads to different morphologies and the special structure of the composites which provide new ideas for the subsequent developments, explain about reaction process between CDs and matrix. The success of the scale&#8208;up experiment demonstrates the potential for large&#8208;scale preparation of this scheme, thereby inspiring future large&#8208;scale production of solid CDs.

         <title>Molecular Hybrid Photocatalysts for CO2 Photoreduction by Hybridization of Molecular Catalysts and Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the hybridization and immobilization strategies of molecular catalysts for CO2 photoreduction on semiconducting covalent organic frameworks, in the absence of additional photosensitizers. The ligand scaffolds of the molecular catalytic motifs involving porphyrin, (poly)pyridine, and salen structures have been discussed for covalent or non&#8208;covalently immobilized examples. Last, future challenges and opportunities are discussed and summarized.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to obtain storable fuels is an effective way to fix and utilize greenhouse gas CO2, ultimately achieving a carbon&#8208;free energy cycle. The core of this goal lies the development of efficient, sustainable, and economically practical catalysts and light absorbers. Currently, hybrid photocatalytic systems that immobilize molecular catalysts on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of intensified interest, as this strategy enables the simultaneous exploitation of the catalytic properties of high&#8208;performance molecular catalysts, together with the durability of heterogeneous semiconductors, based on the readily available synthetic tunability of both components. This review focuses on the significant progress and challenges that have been overcome for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, mediated by COFs hybridized with molecular catalysts, aiming to provide strong guidance for innovative utilization towards sustainable photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the future.

         <title>A Copper(I) Catenane Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Layer as a Heterogenous Catalyst for Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported in this work is a metal&#8208;organic layer decorated with a 2D array of catalytically active Cu(I) catenanes for dehydrogenative C&#9472;O coupling. Kinetic stabilization effects from the interlocked ligands not only preserve the structural integrity of the molecular Cu(I) catalyst for a straightforward attachment onto the solid support, but also maintain the metal in a well&#8208;defined coordination sphere and prevent its undesired oxidation to Cu(II) to give a side product from C&#9472;C coupling.








Abstract
While earth&#8208;abundant metals are green and sustainable alternatives to precious metals for catalytic chemical conversions, the fast ligand exchange involving most of the base metals renders their development into robust, reusable catalysts very challenging. Described in this work is a new type of heterogeneous catalyst derived from a 2D metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) grafted with catenane&#8208;coordinated Cu(I) complexes. In addition to the good substrate accessibility, easy functionalization, and other favorable features due to the MOL support, the mechanical bond in the anchored catenane ligands also represents a new mechanism to dynamically confine the coordination environment and kinetically stabilize the coordinated Cu(I) to give a well&#8208;defined, active yet stable heterogeneous catalyst. Pilot catalytic studies using a model dehydrogenative C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling reaction showed that the Cu(I) catenane&#8208;grafted MOL led to exclusive formation of the C&#9472;O coupled product, whereas control catalysis using a similar Cu(I) catalyst supported by non&#8208;interlocked macrocyclic ligands was found to also give a C&#9472;C coupled by&#8208;product, whose formation was found to be mediated by the uncontrolled oxidation of the Cu(I) to Cu(II), highlighting the distinctive roles and untapped potential of the catenane coordination in developing base metal&#8208;derived catalysts for challenging catalytic conditions.

         <title>Strategies for the Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. It covers chiral separation techniques, the utilization of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalysis, highlighting their versatility in constructing such rotaxanes. Furthermore, the review discusses the applications and future development prospects of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes.








Abstract
Rotaxanes, belonging to the class of classical mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), exhibit chiral properties that diverge from those of traditional chiral elements, particularly displaying mechanically planar chirality. Their distinctive spatial structure further augments their chiral significance, thereby imparting them with vast potential for applications in the realm of chiral materials and asymmetric catalysis. In recent years, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes have garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in obtaining enantiopure mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. In this regard, chiral separation techniques, the use of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalytic synthesis have emerged as potent methodologies for constructing chiral rotaxanes, thereby enabling the synthesis of diverse types of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges faced in this field and look forward to the future development opportunities that lie ahead.

         <title>C3&#8208;symmetric Triple Thia/Sulfone[6]Helicene with Dual Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel triple thia/sulfone[6]helicenes with C3 symmetry are synthesized via Scholl reaction and sulfonation. Their helical structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis. The sulfonation strategy can significantly improve fluorescence quantum yield of thia[6]helicenes. BTT[6]H exhibits unique dual emissions phenomenon circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), due to the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) caused by small energy gap between the lowest excited singlet state (S1) and T5,6 and strong spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Kanamycins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports on creating a novel synthetic route of kanamycins A and B using the desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) reaction of meso&#8208;diol acceptor with 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and regio&#8208; and stereoselective glycosylation of diol acceptor with trichloroacetimidate donor for introduction of a set of challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as key steps.








Abstract
Structurally modified aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, have shown promise as antibiotics and premature termination codon read&#8208;through drugs to fight against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and to treat genetic diseases, respectively. Therefore, research on developing and discovering aminoglycoside antibiotics has recently increased. However, synthetic strategies for controllably positioning the two 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycoside moieties on the symmetrical structure of kanamycin have not yet been established. Herein, we report on a novel route for the total synthesis of kanamycins A and B via regio&#8208; and stereoselective introduction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as the key step. We successfully synthesized &#945;(1,6)&#8208;linked glycoside using a 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol 1,3,5&#8208;orthoformate acceptor in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst via desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery. In addition, we also synthesized &#945;(1,4)&#8208;linked glycoside using its corresponding trichloroacetimidate donor.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Cyanoborate&#8208;Bridged Cubane&#8208;Type Tetranuclear Ru Complex: Synthesis, Pseudopolymorphism, and Coordination Polymer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of a cyanoborate&#8208;based cubane complex. A cubane&#8208;type tetranuclear Ru cage complex bridged by the B(CN)&#8324;&#8315; anion was synthesized via a simple photochemical reaction and yielded various pseudopolymorphs upon recrystallization. This complex was subsequently employed as a building block for the formation of coordination polymers.








Abstract
Cyanoborate anions are versatile bridging ligands that lead to structurally diverse compounds from a crystal engineering perspective. Herein, we report the synthesis of a cubane&#8208;type tetranuclear Ru complex, [Ru4(Cp)4{B(CN)4}4] (1, Cp = C5H5),&#160;obtained by photoirradiation of [Ru(Cp)(C6H6)]B(CN)4 in solution or by the reaction of [CpRu(MeCN)3]+ with KB(CN)4. This complex served as a host for various solvents, generating different pseudopolymorphs, including 1&#183;nCH2Cl2 (n = 1, 2, 3), 1&#183;0.5C6H6, 1&#183;C6H5Me, and 1&#183;3THF upon recrystallization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal engineering of a cyanoborate-based cubane complex&lt;/b&gt;. A cubane-type tetranuclear Ru cage complex bridged by the B(CN)&#8324;&#8315; anion was synthesized via a simple photochemical reaction and yielded various pseudopolymorphs upon recrystallization. This complex was subsequently employed as a building block for the formation of coordination polymers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanoborate anions are versatile bridging ligands that lead to structurally diverse compounds from a crystal engineering perspective. Herein, we report the synthesis of a cubane-type tetranuclear Ru complex, [Ru&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Cp)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{B(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, Cp = C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;),&#160;obtained by photoirradiation of [Ru(Cp)(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]B(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in solution or by the reaction of [CpRu(MeCN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with KB(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This complex served as a host for various solvents, generating different pseudopolymorphs, including &lt;b&gt;1&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&#183;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;1&#183;3THF&lt;/b&gt; upon recrystallization.

         <title>Recent Advances in MOF&#8722;Based Dual&#8722;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advancements in MOF&#8722;based dual&#8722;atom catalysts (DACs) for CO2 reduction. It covers strategies for designing MOF&#8722;DACs, their role in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the influence of dual&#8722;metal synergistic catalysis on catalytic performance for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
In recent years, the development of efficient catalysts for photo&#8722;/electro&#8722;catalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has become a major research focus due to growing environmental concerns and energy demands. Dual&#8722;atom catalysts (DACs), composed of two metal atoms with suitable metal&#8722;metal distance integrated into the supports, have shown great promise in enhancing catalytic performance via the dual&#8722;metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) effect. This review highlights the advancements in Metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8722;based DACs, which combine the high atomic efficiency of DACs with tunable and defined structures and high metal loadings. In this review, we summarized the recent developments on the synthesis strategies of MOF&#8722;based DACs and their applications in CO2RR, focusing on the role of DMSC effect in improving catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. Additionally, we also discuss the influence of the local electronic structure, coordination environment, and metal atom interactions on catalytic performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of MOF&#8722;based DACs and offers insights into their future potential in sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Synthesis of C4&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Cross&#8208;Ketonization: The Importance of Precise Temperature Control in Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of reversed C&#8208;glycosides from carboxylic acid building blocks is enabled by metallaphotoredox cross&#8208;ketonization. Precise temperature control is essential for matching the rates of the photoredox and Ni catalytic processes, an understudied factor in photoredox chemistry that could be critical in the study of other dual&#8208;catalytic photoredox systems.








Abstract
We describe herein a method for the synthesis of reversed C&#8208;acyl glycosides by direct cross&#8208;ketonization of linear carboxylic acids with carboxy sugars under metallaphotoredox conditions. This reaction proves to be highly sensitive to reaction temperature, with the reproducibility and yield of ketonization highly dependent upon precise temperature control. Analysis of the reaction mechanism suggests this sensitivity reflects the need to match the rate of Ni catalytic turnover with the rate of photocatalytic decarboxylation of the carboxy sugar. The insights gained from this study have important implications for the study of all metallaphotoredox reactions as well as other photoreactions that involve dual catalytic cycles.

         <title>Litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like NiMoP2 microspheres supported on MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer as high performance composite positive electrode of asymmetric supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing ideal positive electrodes with excellent performance and structural stability for supercapacitors is crucial in enhancing the application potential. Herein, we successfully fabricate a composite structure of NiMoP2@C on nickel foam (NMP@C/NF), which is formed by loading a litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres onto MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer with the two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. The carbon layer acts as a structurally stable framework, and its synergistic effect with active materials suppresses volume expansion while enhancing electron transport efficiency. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface between crystalline/amorphous phases optimizes redox reaction kinetics, and the unique morphology composed of multi&#8208;scale components increases the accessible surface area for redox reactions. As a result, the NMP@C/NF obtains a high specific capacitance of 2224.8 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.97% after 8000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NMP@C/NF positive electrode and active carbon negative electrode generates an energy density of 52.52 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 784.55 W kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance retention rate reaches up to 78% after 8000 cycles. This study provides promising pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly positive electrodes for supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies on Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Tabercarpamines and Voacangine&#8208;Type Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The proposed post&#8208;iboga natural products, (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, along with their corresponding C20 stereoisomers and C10&#8208;methoxy&#8208;regioisomers were synthesized. An extensive NMR spectroscopic study showed that the spectral data of these synthetic compounds were not consistent with the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I in isolation report, indicating that the proposed structures were misassigned. Subsequently, from the advanced intermediates for the synthesis of the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, the unified enantioselective syntheses of six iboga&#8210;type natural products including (&#8208;)&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;voacangine, (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;voacangine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanoisovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanovoacangine were accomplished via a divergent manner. The synthetic route provided the first catalytic asymmetric approach to access these three types of iboga&#8210;type natural products and achieved the first enantioselective syntheses of (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines. Our synthesis hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reorganization process from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system&#8213;a pathway opposite to the proposed biogenic synthesis&#8213;at the late stage.</dc:description>

         <title>Amination of 1&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;Bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;Sulfonic Acid Enabled by Alternating Current Electrolysis of Symmetrical Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amination of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone&#8208;type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a groundbreaking strategy for the in&#8208;situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post&#8208;treatment.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amination of 1-amino-4-bromoanthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone-type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a groundbreaking strategy for the in-situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5-diamino-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post-treatment. Characterization techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal that the passive Cu2O film formed on the symmetrical Cu electrodes under AC electrolysis continuously generates Cu+, which is crucial for the reaction. This approach is scalable, environmentally friendly, and holds great potential for industrial applications, offering substantial economic benefits while reducing environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Allosteric Differentiation of Al(I) Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimeric potassium alumanyl reacts with phenyl&#8208;substituted alkynes to provide not only alkyne cycloaddition but also para&#8208;C&#8211;H activation of the phenyl substituent. Supported by a theoretical study, this outcome is judged to arise from a sequence of cooperative steps and a mode of kinetic discrimination that is suggested to be allosteric in origin.








Abstract
The dimeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 ({SiNDipp} = {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3), reacts with two equivalents of PhC&#8801;CR (R = Ph or SiMe3) with the exclusive formation of the aluminacyclopropene derivatives, [{SiNDipp}Al{&#951;2&#8208;C2(R1)(R2)}]. In contrast, reactions with an equal stoichiometry of both alumanyl and alkyne reagents provide the products of not only alkyne cycloaddition but also para&#8208;C&#8211;H activation of a phenyl substituent. Supported by a theoretical study, this outcome is judged to result from a sequence of cooperative steps and the introduction of a modicum of kinetic discrimination that is suggested to be allosteric in origin.

         <title>Influence of Polymeric Dispersants on the Dissolution Rate of Tricalcium Silicate and the Nucleation of Calcium&#8208;Silicate&#8208;Hydrate and Portlandite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comb&#8208;copolymers with anionic functional groups and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains are concrete dispersants. However, they retard the hydration of the main Portland cement phase Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$. Herein, we report on their influence on the dissolution rate of Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$ and their nucleation&#8208;inhibiting effect on calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate and calcium hydroxide. For phosphate and carboxylate groups, higher charge densities lead to stronger nucleation&#160;inhibition.







Abstract
Polycarboxylate ether (PCE) and polyphosphate ether (PPE) dispersants (also known as superplasticizers) are indispensable components of modern concrete mix designs. They reduce the yield stress of cement suspensions and thereby facilitate the reduction of the water&#8208;to&#8208;cement ratio. However, PCEs and PPEs also cause retardation of the cement hydration as a secondary effect, which causes delayed concrete strength development. It is proposed that the retardation is caused by the polymer influence on the tricalcium silicate dissolution rate and the crystallization of the hydration products (e.g., calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2$_2$ and calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate 1.7CaO&#183;SiO2&#183;4H2O$1.7\mathrm{CaO}\cdot {\mathrm{SiO}}_{2}\cdot 4{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ or C&#8208;S&#8208;H). This study examines the effect of four different polymeric superplasticizers with carboxylate and phosphate groups on the reaction kinetics of the pure cement phase tricalcium silicate (in cement shorthand C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$). Our results confirm the strong retarding effect of the polymers on the hydration reaction of the C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ paste. Based on model experiments, we studied the polymer influence on the dissolution of C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ and the nucleation of the hydration products. We observed no C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ dissolution&#8208;inhibiting effect of the polymers at the chosen concentrations and undersaturation. However, such an inhibiting effect may occur at solution conditions closer to the saturation limit. Titrimetric analyses indicate that all polymers suppress the nucleation of portlandite and C&#8208;S&#8208;H, with a higher polymer charge density leading to a more pronounced&#160;inhibition.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of Pd Nanoclusters in Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs rich in N and S sites were utilized to anchor Pd ions and grow in situ into Pd nanoclusters. This enabled the IEF enhancement to drive the directional migration of photogenerated electrons and promote carrier separation. Meanwhile, the introduced Pd NCs act as active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, realizing the efficiency enhancement of CO2 conversion to CO under visible light.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction offers a promising strategy to mitigate the greenhouse effect, yet it remains a challenging process due to the high energy barrier associated with the high stability of CO2. In this study, we synthesized Py&#8208;bTDC, a pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) enriched with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and anchored palladium nanoclusters (Pd NCs) onto its structure to enhance CO2 reduction efficiency. The confined Pd NCs amplify the built&#8208;in electric field (IEF), enabling efficient photogenerated carrier migration and suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination. Simultaneously, Pd NCs serve as catalytic active sites, optimizing CO2 adsorption and activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Pd reduces the energy barrier for forming the critical intermediate (*COOH), thereby accelerating CO production. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in a gas&#8208;solid system using water as a proton donor, the Pd3/Py&#8208;bTDC composite achieved a CO evolution rate of 17.75 &#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 with 86.0% selectivity. This study advances the design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts by synergistically modulating IEF and the engineering active sites for efficient CO2 reduction.

Abstract
The development of rapid, cost&#8208;effective fluorescent probes for antipsychotic drug detection remains challenging due to the synthetic complexity of conventional probes and limited exploration of natural alternatives. Herein, we pioneered bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a natural clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) probe for one&#8208;step detection of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) and perphenazine (PPZ). The unique CTE property of BSA displayed concentration&#8208;dependent quenching with CPZ and PPZ. Moreover, the quenching effect achieved balance within 5&#160;minutes and maintained stability for more than 30&#160;minutes. Based on these advantages, the proposed detection platform showed rapid response, operational simplicity, visual signal readout, wide detection range, ultra&#8208;low detection limits, compared with other methods. Moreover, the assay method exhibited excellent selectivity, facilitating satisfactory reliability for the real sample assay. Thermodynamic analyses revealed distinct interaction mechanisms between BSA and antipsychotics, both inducing static quenching by suppressing clusterization&#8208;induced electron transitions. Overall, this research not only develops a novel assay method for CPZ and PPZ, but also broadens the application potential of the CTE effect in natural biomacromolecules. As the first demonstration of natural CTE probes for antipsychotic detection, this work opens new frontiers for sustainable analytical technologies by circumventing synthetic probe complexities and leveraging inherent biorecognition.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;Containing Triterpenoid Saponins Inhibit DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;Mediated Transfer of HIV&#8208;1 Infection</title>

         <dc:description>Blocking DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated HIV&#8208;1 attachment to immune cells represents a promising strategy for developing antiretroviral agents effective during the early stages of sexual transmission. Although mannose&#8208; and fucose&#8208;based ligands have received considerable attention, Lewis&#8208;based inhibitors remain relatively underexplored. In this study, we report the first synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins featuring betulinic acid and echinocystic acid as aglycones. These saponins were stereoselectively and efficiently synthesized in six linear steps using a convergent approach that leveraged thioglycoside and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation chemistries. Notably, our findings demonstrate that these Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins are among the most potent monovalent inhibitors reported to date of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8208; and L&#8208;SIGN&#8208;mediated transfer of HIV&#8208;1 infection to CD4&#8208;positive cells, with IC50&#160;values in the low micromolar range (21&#8208;50 mM). This work lays a valuable foundation for the development of saponin&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting immune cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Protonation and Iron(II) Complexation on Magnetic Interactions in Spin&#8208;Labeled Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates the influence of protonation and Fe(II) complexation on exchange coupling and magnetic properties in a [2]&#8208;rotaxane and its free&#8208;axle biradicals. Mechanical bonding markedly modifies magnetic interactions, highlighting its potential for enabling the design of interlocked molecules with tunable spin states for advanced applications in molecular electronics and spintronics.








Abstract
This study reports the effects of protonation and Fe(II) complexation on the exchange coupling and magnetic properties of a [2]&#8208;rotaxane and its corresponding free&#8208;axle biradicals. The rotaxane features nitronyl&#8208;nitroxide units as bulky stopper groups, a triazole&#8208;pyridine&#8208;triazole ligand as the axle component, and a bipyridine moiety within the macrocyclic ring. Our findings, obtained by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy in solution and magnetometry in solid state, demonstrate that rotaxanation and protonation induce profound changes in the magnetic interactions of the biradical both in its free form and as complexed with Fe(II). These results highlight the transformative impact of the mechanical bond on the electronic structure of interlocked radical systems.

         <title>Unlocking Thermodynamic Enolate for Kinetically Controlled Desymmetrizing Vinylogous (4+1) Carbospiroannulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective (4+1) carbospiroannulation is catalyzed by an l&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine dipeptide thiourea catalyst, which efficiently constructs chiral [4,4]nonane frameworks with exceptional stereocontrol. The reaction is effective on a wide variety of substrates, resulting in high yields. DFT studies offer critical mechanistic insights, while additional transformations demonstrate the synthetic potential of the products.








Abstract
An unprecedented thermodynamically unfavorable (4+1) deysmmetrizing spiroannulation through a thermodynamic enolate intermediate, enabling a single&#8208;step synthesis of ubiquitous scaffolds such as all&#8208;carbon chiral spirocycles, is disclosed. In this spiroannulation, we present a vinylogous organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing (4+1) cycloaddition approach involving alkylidene malononitrile and cyclopent&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienone. This carbospiroannulation method produces functionally enriched spiro[4,4]nonane structures with three stereocenters, has presented good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Detailed DFT calculations reveal an intriguing reaction mechanism, which validates our observations.

         <title>Understanding the Properties of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Substituted Boron Difluoride 3&#8208;Cyanoformazanate Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes are easily synthesized and offer far red to near&#8208;IR emission properties despite their relatively simple structure. This work focuses on understanding these unexpected properties and shows that the electron poor boron difluoride formazanate core leads to these dyes operating outside of the traditional understanding of electronic structure augmentation upon substitution with donor and acceptor substituents.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated materials offer attractive traits including semiconductivity, low&#8208;energy light absorption/photoluminescence, and solution processability that render them ubiquitous within the organic electronics field. Among many strategies for property tuning, the creation of asymmetric electronic structures through the installation of donor and acceptor substituents commonly results in low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands. Boron difluoride formazanate dyes are readily synthesized, can be asymmetrically substituted with donor and acceptor groups, and have unexpectedly low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands that extend into the near&#8208;infrared. In this study, we prepared a series of donor&#8208;acceptor substituted boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes and compared their properties to symmetric analogues. Our findings suggest that donor&#8208;acceptor derivatives are highly delocalized with properties intermediate of their symmetric counterparts. Furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the N&#8208;aryl substituents act as donors to the strongly accepting boron difluoride formazanate core, regardless of the functional groups appended to them. These properties were reproduced computationally, and while the frontier orbitals calculated for donor&#8208;acceptor dyes were modestly asymmetric, there was no evidence of charge&#8208;transfer character. This work provides significant insight into the unexpected properties of boron difluoride formazanates and reveals that their strongly accepting nature circumvents the predicted augmentation of electronic structure commonly observed for donor&#8208;accepter substituted dyes.

         <title>A Very Readily Prepared Ligand for Rhodium Catalysed Propene Hydroformylation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make ligand that would lead to Rh catalysts that give very rare preferential formation of&#160;iso&#8208;butanal from propene hydroformylation,&#160;bis&#8208;phosphonites and&#160;bis&#8208;phosphoramidites were designed. Catalysts derived from&#160;bis&#8208;phosphonites gave the desired low&#160;n:isoratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis.&#160;A&#160;bis&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh&#8208;catalysed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Infra&#8208;Red spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000 mol/mol in one hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most&#160;iso&#8208;selective example, had a partially flexible&#160;n:iso&#160;ratio depending on temperature and pressure. Two Pt(II) complexes were prepared and their X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined.&#160;The most&#160;iso&#8208;selective catalyst was examined at low temperature(prioritising&#160;iso&#8208;selectivity over rates) in hydroformylation of some other terminal alkenes with significant branched selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C, Novel Lobster&#8208;shape Cinnamoyltriketone Dimers with Antiviral Activities from Xanthostemon chrysanthus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three pairs of enantiomeric cinnamoyltriketone dimers, (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;xanthochrysanthones A&#8722;C [(+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8211;3)], were recognized and obtained from Xanthostemon chrysanthus by employing the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes Supported by a Functionalized PC(sp3)P Pincer Ligand: Properties and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of interconvertible high&#8208;valent nickel complexes supported by a rigid pincer ligand is described. The nickel center exhibits remarkable stability and predictable coordination in oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. Notably, the Ni(III) complex functions as an efficient and selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkenes.








Abstract
This article presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of robust high&#8208;valent organometallic nickel (Ni) complexes stabilized by a functionalized PC(sp3)P pincer ligand. Notably, the nickel center, covalently confined within the 3D ligand framework, demonstrates predictable coordination and redox behavior, coupled with remarkable stability across oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. These states were found to interconvert via one&#8208;electron transfer reactions. Among these complexes, the Ni(III)&#8208;PC(sp3)P species was identified as an efficient catalyst for the mild and selective hydrosilylation of alkenes, operating through a nonoxidative reaction mechanism.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Lactam Ylidenes: an Overlooked Class of N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the underappreciated class of &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is revisited and systematically explored. The required precursors are available in a highly modular synthetic approach from simple starting materials. Two routes may be followed for the generation of the free BLCs: thermal fragmentation of spiro&#8208;fused oxadiazoles (110 &#176;C, toluene), or deprotonation of carbene HCl&#8208;adducts at &#8208;80 &#176;C with a strong base. TEP values (2065&#8208;2072 cm&#8208;1), 77Se NMR shifts of selenium&#8208;adducts (812&#8208;995 ppm) as well as DFT calculations reveal moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of BLCs, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity. The formation of a wide variety of products under thermal conditions in the cause of oxadiazole fragmentation (110 &#176;C, toluene) is rationalized by a combination of computational reaction discovery and experimental validation. Products include olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers arising from bimolecular reactions, while sterically more demanding precursors are converted in a monomolecular fragmentation reaction via CO release to form ketenimines as intermediates, which finally form amides. With substituents providing appropriate steric protection, a persistent BLC is available via the low temperature route, characterized by its 13C NMR shift of 287 ppm at &#8208;20 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Crystals of A Covalent Organic Polymer for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic polymers (COPs) with high crystallinity and excellent stability is very important for potential applications in photocatalysis and environmental remediation. However, most COPs are amorphous, limiting their structural characterization, photocatalytic performance and mechanism exploration. In this study, we report the construction of a crystalline one&#8208;dimensional COP (CityU&#8208;49) via dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds using 3,6&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (DPC) as the nitrogen donor and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) as the boron donor. The dynamic and directional nature of B&#8592;N bonds enables a self&#8208;healing and self&#8208;correcting assembly process, resulting in a highly crystalline and stable structure. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) revealed the precise structure of CityU&#8208;49, providing insights into its ordered architecture. The photocatalytic performance of CityU&#8208;49 was conducted to investigat the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) (a persistent and toxic organic pollutant). Under UV light irradiation, CityU&#8208;49 achieves 95% degradation of RhB in 300 minutes, demonstrating excellent photocatalytic activity and environmental applicability. This study highlights the potential of crystalline COPs as efficient and sustainable photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of advanced materials for environmental remediation and green technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Release of Natural Glycans (ORNG): Preparation of Truncated N&#8208;glycans for Engineering Glycoproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;glycosylation on asparagine is one of the most common post&#8208;translational modifications of proteins. The synthesis of homogeneous N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins is crucial for elucidating the concerted functions of glycans and peptides. Multiple endoglycosidase mutants have been developed to efficiently catalyze the coupling of oxazoline derivatives of N&#8208;glycans lacking the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycan) with peptide chains bearing a GlcNAcylated asparagine. However, the bottleneck for N&#8208;glycopeptide and glycoprotein synthesis remains access to these complex truncated N&#8208;glycan substrates in sufficient diversity and quantity. Here, we report a novel chemical method using modified oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG) to produce a diverse library of mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, paving the way for the facile synthesis of N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Using these substrates, homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies can be efficiently achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>In Pursuit of Carbon Neutrality: Progresses and Innovations in Sorbents for Direct Air Capture of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses cutting&#8208;edge sorbents emphasizing on material design with critical evaluation of performance metrics, limitations, and future possibilities, establishing a robust foundation for advancing scalable DAC technologies and contributing to global efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality.








Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) is of immense current interest, as a means to facilitate CO2 capture at low concentrations (&#8764;400&#160;ppm) directly from the atmosphere, with the aim of addressing global warming caused by excessive anthropogenic CO2 production. Traditionally, DAC of CO2 has relied on amine scrubbing and metal carbonate /hydroxide solutions. However, recent years have seen notable progress in DAC sorbents, with key advancements aimed at improving efficiency, capacity, and regenerability while reducing energy consumption. This review delivers an exhaustive analysis of contemporary developments in DAC sorbents, addressing the innovations in material design and consequent performance enhancement. The limitations of the sorbents have also been discussed, with future perspectives for improving sustainable CO2 capture strategies. We anticipate that this overview will help lay the groundwork for further development and large&#8208;scale implementation of sustainable sorbents and cutting&#8208;edge technologies toward attaining carbon neutrality.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced&#160;Reversible Switching of Electronic Delocalization in a Linear Ru&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ru Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first example of a molecular switch between electronic delocalization and electronic localization in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged trinuclear mixed&#8208;valence (MV) complex controlled by a protonation reaction. A MV complex with the terminal 2,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pyridine (L) ligand which has a higher proton&#8208;accepting character, LRuIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIIL (13+) was synthesized and well characterized. The investigations indicate that the interaction between the two terminal Ru centers of 13+ is so strong that it is fully delocalized and can be described as LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L. Most interestingly, 13+ can be reversibly protonated to 13+&#8208;2H coupled with an electron transfer from the central RuII to the terminal RuIII, resulting in a change in electronic structure from LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L to HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIILH. Cyclic voltammetry of 13+&#8208;2H showed very weak interaction between the two terminal Ru centers. The remarkable change in electronic states by protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer is also strongly supported by the (TD)DFT calculations. Complex 13+ may be potential for an excellent candidate of molecular switch.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugate Triggered Red Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Single Benzene&#160;Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzene is the simplest and the most basic building block for the construction of &#960; conjugated systems, which are widely used in various fields from fluorescent dyes to optoelectronic displays. However, achieving the red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from single benzene is still challenging. Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation strategy, herein, we report a single benzene&#8208;based push&#8208;pull system with red RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585 nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545 nm, 635 nm, and 700 nm. This architecture is uniquely separate from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and minimizes the requirement for red/NIR phosphors to a single benzene ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Excimer&#8208;Like Emission From a &#960;&#8208;Stacked Trichromophore Comprising Perylene Monoimide and Perylene Diimide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ground&#8208;state structure of the target trichromophore has the individual modules arranged in a parallel stack, with moderate excitonic coupling leading to a distorted absorption spectrum. Under illumination, the tripartite molecular arrangement shifts in favor of a bipartite system displaying broad excimer emission at room temperature. The dynamics for this structural displacement are monitored by transient spectroscopy.








Abstract
A trichromophore has been synthesized comprising a perylene diimide sandwiched between two perylene monoimide diester (PMIDE) units and held in place by xanthene spacers. The DFT computed structure indicates &#960;&#8208;stacking of the three polycycles, with a mean interplanar separation of 4.2&#258;, but with the central unit displaced sideways. Phenyl groups inserted between xanthene and perylene help to rigidify the structure. Electronic interactions between perylene polycycles splits the absorption spectrum, which is dominated by transitions to the upper&#8208;lying H&#8208;state. Excimer&#8208;like emission is observed in solution at room temperature, for which the lifetime is &#8776;22&#160;ns in toluene and &#8776;8&#160;ns in CH2Cl2. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates the instantaneous formation of a Franck&#8208;Condon state, which undergoes rapid vibrational cooling to populate the low&#8208;lying J&#8208;state. This species transforms over 40&#8211;60&#160;ps into an excimer&#8208;like state wherein the exciton is delocalized over all three perylenes. A slower structural re&#8208;arrangement, complete within 1&#160;ns, minimizes electronic interactions with one of the PMIDE units and stabilizes the resultant bipartite excimer&#8208;like state.

         <dc:description>
Tetradentate PNNP&#8208;ligated Ir complexes serve as multifunctional catalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrating exceptional efficiency across photochemical, thermal, and electrochemical systems. By tailoring ligand structures, these catalysts enable selective and durable CO2 conversion under light, heat, and electricity, providing a versatile and unified approach toward sustainable carbon utilization and energy&#8208;efficient fuel production.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products remains a keystone of sustainable energy research. Achieving this goal requires catalytic methodologies that can adapt to diverse energy sources such as light, heat, or electricity. This concept highlights the remarkable versatility of tetradentate PNNP&#8208;ligated iridium complexes, (PNNP)Ir, as multifunctional catalysts, which demonstrate outstanding performance in CO2 reduction across photochemical, thermal, and electrochemical systems. By fine&#8208;tuning the ligand structure for each system, (PNNP)Ir complexes achieved remarkable efficiency, selectivity, and durability across all applications.

Abstract
Herein, an &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of C&#8208;glycoside with 1&#8208;bromosugars and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones is reported, leveraging visible light&#8208;mediated excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. This process involves the generation of glycosyl radicals from easily accessible 1&#8208;bromosugar precursors, which can capture quinoxalinone under photoinduced Pd(0) catalysis. The reaction operates under mild conditions, offering excellent axial selectivity with a diverse array of substrates. This methodology will provide a valuable platform for constructing potent biologically active C&#8208;glycosides.

         <dc:description>
Two thermal stability and insensitive energetic compounds were design and synthesized by constructing conjugated planar structure based on imino bridged nitrogen&#8208;rich frameworks. All the newly prepared compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (Td: 316.5&#8211;343.9&#8201;&#176;C) and sensitivities (IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N), which are superior to those of the widely used heat&#8208;resistant explosive HNS. indicating its potential to be used as heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials.







Abstract
Developing insensitive heat&#8208;resistant energetic materials is currently a significant challenge in the research of energetic materials. In this study, two heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials (compounds 3 and 4) were designed and prepared by constructing conjugated planar structure based on the imino bridged (&#8722;NH&#8722;) azoles and 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,6&#8208;dinitropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;7&#8208;amine. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (Td: 316.5&#8211;343.9&#8201;&#176;C) and good detonation performances (D: 8183&#8211;8206&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory sensitivities (IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N). These remarkable stabilities are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar structures and strong weak interactions in crystals. The comprehensive performances of compound 4 (Td: 343.9&#8201;&#176;C, D: 8183&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N) are superior to those of the widely used heat&#8208;resistant explosive 2,2&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (Td: 318&#8201;&#176;C, D: 7612&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS: 5&#8197;J, FS: 240&#8197;N), indicating its potential to be used as heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials.

         <title>A Parameter&#8208;Driven Approach to Modulating Chemical Composition in Prussian Blue Analogues Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores electroneutrality&#8242;s role in synthesizing sodium&#8208;based Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), focusing on Na+ ion diffusion and its effect on crystal structure. It examines how temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed influence Na+ incorporation, vacancies, and water content, offering insights for optimizing PBAs in energy storage.







Abstract
This study explores how various experimental factors, such as temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed, affect Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) materials&#8216; structural properties and electroneutrality. These factors influence key attributes like sodium ions, vacancies, and water content, which is governed by electroneutrality. Higher temperatures, faster stirring, low viscosity, and high Na+ concentration enhance Na+ incorporation because of the sufficient Na+ supplement, leading to a densified monoclinic structure with fewer vacancies and lower water content. In contrast, lower temperatures, slow stirring, high viscosity, and low Na+ concentration lead to less monoclinic or cubic structures with more vacancies and higher water content. Adding carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) increases viscosity, enables lower Na+ diffusion, and renders less Na+ incorporation. As a result, an intermediate structure forms with balanced Na+ and water content, bridging the cubic and monoclinic forms. The electrochemical performance of cubic structures (PW&#8208;Cub) is superior, demonstrating better C&#8208;rate performance with distinct charge&#8208;discharge plateaus than monoclinic structures acquired at high temperatures (PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT). The PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT shows the mixed redox reactions between Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+. This study reveals the root cause for the variation in PBAs&#8242; chemical composition and provides a guideline for synthesizing high&#8208;quality PBAs for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Molecular Bowls Comprising Adjacent Pentagons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended nitrogen&#8208;centered molecular bowls containing adjacent pentagonal rings are synthesized and characterized. While the peripherally fused benzene rings contribute minimally to the bowl curvature, the functional groups in the molecular bowls exert a pronounced influence on the host&#8208;guest binding constants observed in solution&#8208;phase interactions with fullerene.








Abstract
While the classical buckybowls, such as corannulene, and sumanene, have been extensively investigated, research on other molecular bowls containing double neighboring pentagonal rings remains underdeveloped. Here we present the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped molecular bowls incorporating adjacent pentagonal motifs with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface. Their molecular curvatures are preserved according to the analyses of bowl&#8208;depth, &#960;&#8208;orbital axis vector angles, and inversion energy barrier when compared to those of their parent structures. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation induces the bathochromic shifts of both absorption and emission spectra, the narrowed energy gaps of the frontier molecular orbitals, as well as the enhanced aromatic character in the fused pentagonal rings. Furthermore, the extended aromatic surface enables the binding with fullerene C60 in solution.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical decarboxylative late&#8208;stage functionalization of the C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminus of natural amino acids is presented. Metal and catalyst&#8208;free protocol widely explored the synthesis of hindered ethers, amines, or di&#8208;peptide.








Abstract
A unified electrochemical decarboxylative strategy for the site&#8208;selective construction of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds is disclosed herein. The metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free decarboxylation provides access to the functionalization of C&#8208; and N&#8208;terminus from the simple amino acid feedstock. A wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary acids or alcohols were well tolerated. Late&#8208;stage functionalization using &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose, di&#8208;peptide, steroid derivatives, and bio&#8208;active drug molecules established the robustness and synthesis potential of our approach.

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;Based Fluorochromogenic Tweezer for Reversible and Portable Detection of Al3+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ESIPT&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208;derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; regenerable fluoro&#8208;chromogenic molecular tweezer NPDM is employed for the portable and selective detection and visualization of Al3&#8314; in real samples. NPDM can trace intracellular Al3&#8314; and F&#8315; ions without interference from oxidative stress, and it is the first reported smart molecular tweezer capable of detecting Al3&#8314; ions generated during the electroporation within living cells.








Abstract
ESIPT&#8208;based fluorochromes are promising materials for the detection of various chemical and biological species, particularly metal cations. Herein, we have meticulously designed a prototypical ESIPT&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208;derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorogenic tweezer, NPDM, for&#160;the selective detection and visualization of Al3&#8314; in biological and environmental samples. NPDM was found to specifically interact with Al3&#8314;, exhibiting dual emissions, high sensitivity (50 s), large Stokes shifts (140 and 176&#160;nm), and a low detection limit of 16.3&#160;nM. Notably, the sensing mechanism of NPDM for Al3&#8314; involves metal ion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (CHEF), ESIPT &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; effect as well as restricted intramolecular rotation (RIR). This mechanism is supported by Job's plot, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (&#185;H NMR) titrations,&#160;and density functional (DFT) calculations. Interestingly, the NPDM&#8208;Al3+ ensemble can function as a secondary chromo&#8208;fluorogenic tweezer for monitoring fluoride ions (F&#8722;) with a low detection limit of 34.8&#160;nM. Thus, an advanced molecular memory device was constructed based on the fluorescence &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8208;off&#8221; strategy and its excellent sensing properties. Moreover, a portable, smartphone&#8208;assisted intelligent platform has been developed to facilitate in&#8208;field, cost&#8208;effective, and accurate detection of Al3&#8314; in real environmental water samples. Significantly, NPDM was successfully employed to image intracellular Al3&#8314; and F&#8315; ions in HeLa cells without interference from oxidative stress. This represents the first reported smart molecular tweezer capable of detecting Al3&#8314; ions generated during electroporation within living cells. Furthermore, the strategy developed here is valuable for the creation of novel, practically beneficial luminescent molecules and offers an advanced luminescent detection platform for point&#8208;of&#8208;care sensing of health&#8208;related ionic species.

&lt;p&gt;ESIPT-based fluorochromes are promising materials for the detection of various chemical and biological species, particularly metal cations.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Dependent Energy&#8208;Gap Modulation of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems Based on Hypervalent Silicon(IV)&#8208;Fused Azomethine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel system to modulate the energy gaps of &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds by using geometrical isomers, square pyramidal (SPY) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBPY) geometries, based on five&#8208;coordinated hypervalent silicon&#8208;fused azomethine compounds. It is revealed that the energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that of the SPY one owing to the stronger contribution of a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are dynamically changeable with external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations.








Abstract
The colors of substances and emissions are determined by the width of the energy gap between frontier molecular orbitals. In general, significant structural transformation or chemical modification is essential to tune the energy gap. Herein, we reveal a hypervalent silicon compound that can form both square pyramidal (SPY) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBPY) geometries and demonstrate a novel technique to modulate the energy gap of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that in the SPY geometry owing to the stronger contribution of a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are changeable by external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations. Correspondingly, the emission bands in the orange (&#955;PL = 640&#160;nm) and yellow (&#955;PL = 579&#160;nm) regions were observed from the TBPY geometry at room temperature and the SPY geometry at &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, the geometry can be fixed to the TBPY geometry by introducing bulky substituents at silicon. These mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically clarified in detail. Our findings described here are expected to be a novel molecular design for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>[natY/90Y]Yttrium and [natLu/177Lu]Lutetium Complexation by Rigid H4OCTAPA Derivatives. Effect of Ligand Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of the central spacer and the topology of the chelator plays a crucial role in the stability of [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ OCTAPA derivatives relevant for radiopharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/90Y]Y3+ and [nat/177Lu]Lu3+ with the new acyclic chelator H4CHXOITAPA. This octadentate chelator forms nine&#8208;coordinated Y3+ and Lu3+ complexes thanks to the coordination of a water molecule, as demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray structure of [Y(HCHXOITAPA)(H2O)] and 1H, 13C, and 89Y NMR studies in solution. These complexes display slightly higher thermodynamic stabilities compared with those of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, reaching log KYL and log KLuL values of 21.24(5) and 21.96(1), respectively. Kinetic studies indicate that these complexes dissociate mainly through the spontaneous and proton&#8208;assisted pathways at pH 7.4. The chelator can be readily radiolabeled with [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ at room temperature in 10&#160;min. The radio&#8208;complexes are stable in human serum at 37 &#176;C, in contrast with the analogues of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, which experience significant dissociation under these conditions. Thus, the H4CHXOITAPA chelator represents the most promising candidate among the H4OCTAPA family for the development of 90Y&#8208; and 177Lu&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Multifunctional Alternating Copolymer Nanoflower Iodine Hosts for Long&#8208;Term Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a novel multifunctional alternating copolymer nanoflower iodine host as the cathode for Zn&#8208;I2 battery. It has combined the advantages of high&#8208;density polar groups, porous structure, and hydrophilic surface, and thus has exhibited efficient inhibition of the polyiodide shuttle effect. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Zn&#8208;I2 battery achieves a high performance in specific capacity and cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries are considered to be potential energy storage systems due to their safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the shuttle effect of polyiodide leads to cathode active mass loss and anode Zn corrosion, which greatly reduces the cycle life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. Herein, we report an N&#8208;modified alternating copolymer nanoflower composite (NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA) as a new type of iodine host candidate to effectively inhibit the polyiodide shuttle effect in Zn&#8208;I2 battery. As a result, the NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA/I2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I2 battery demonstrates a high specific capacity of 185.42 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 99%. Moreover, it exhibits excellent cycling stability, achieving 10,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.0008% per cycle, ranking it among the best&#8208;performing polymeric host&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries in the literature. Density functional theory (DFT) and in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements illustrate the impressive suppression of polyiodide shuttle effect comes from the strong interaction between N&#8208;modification enhanced polyhydroxy sites in NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA and polyiodide. This work may shed new light on the design of advanced polymeric iodine hosts in Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries.

         <dc:description>The Minisci&#8208;type reaction between C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics was carried out using a simple protocol based on the persulfate anion (PS) under microwave (MW) irradiation. The MW/PS protocol has been found to be applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of N&#8208;heteroaromatics and C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds, leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics. Site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by HAT with the sulfate radical affecting the polar/steric effects in the transition state. The MW/PS protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered rings fused by pyridine and lutidine, which, in previous methods, it was necessary to use tedious derivatization to imino&#8208;oxyacetic acids as HAT precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Conclusive Insight into the Coordination Complexes of a Flexible Bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) Ligand and their Phase&#8208;dependent Structure: a Multi&#8208;technique Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin&#8208;free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8211;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3&#8208;phenylene bridge (H2bdhb = 1,3&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1&#8208;hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb2&#8211; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)2(bdhb)2] (1) and [Co2(bdhb)2(py)4] (2), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb2&#8211; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi&#8208;macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn2+ analogue of 1 and 2, namely [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] (3). Although both 2 and 3 are dimeric and contain the same ligands, 3 features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI&#8208;MS spectra of 3 in THF and CH2Cl2&#160;contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on J&#8208;coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of 3 into quasi&#8208;macrocyclic monomers in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2 solution at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalized Cyanine Fluorogenic Dimers for Improved Detection of GPCRs: Application to imaging of ApelinR in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic dimers enable background&#8208;free imaging of biological targets under wash&#8208;free conditions owing to a strong fluorescence enhancement in the apolar cell microenvironment. However, it is crucial that the imaging probe interacts solely with the target receptor to avoid non&#8208;specific interactions and ensure detection with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, we describe a convenient and rapid approach for the synthesis of various functionalized cyanine dyes by click chemistry allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of the physicochemical and fluorogenic properties of the dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study was conducted for the fluorogenic dimers in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and liposomes as models of serum proteins and cell membranes. We identified d&#8208;Cy&#8208;E which combined the lowest non&#8208;specific interactions with the optimal fluorescence turn&#8208;on properties. By conjugating d&#8208;Cy&#8208;E to a peptide ligand of the apelin GPCR, we developed Ap&#8208;d&#8208;Cy&#8208;E, the first fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe for the background&#8208;free imaging of this receptor in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing &#945;&#8208;MnO2 Tunnel Structure via Mo&#8211;Zn Synergistic Doping for Highly Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrothermal process is used for co&#8208;doping Mo and Zn into tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 (MZMO), enhancing its ion diffusion kinetics and electrical conductivity by introducing impurity energy levels and generating oxygen vacancies. This co&#8208;doping strategy also stabilizes the MnO2 framework, enabling the MZMO cathode to achieve exceptional capacity, highly reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;intercalation, and prolonged cycle life.








Abstract
To address the rising demand for eco&#8208;friendly and efficient energy storage devices, rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage. &#945;&#8208;MnO2 has attracted extensive attention for its open channels and exceptional Zn2+ storage capacity. However, the electrochemical performance of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 is significantly hindered by severe structural collapse and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose a simple hydrothermal approach for co&#8208;doping Mo and Zn into tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 (MZMO). The ion diffusion kinetics of MZMO are optimized due to ameliorated electrical conductivity by doped cations and introduced oxygen vacancies within the MnO2 lattice. Moreover, Mo and Zn co&#8208;doping stabilizes the MnO2 framework, significantly enhancing its electrochemical performance during prolonged cycling. Charge storage mechanism analysis further validates the extraordinary stability of the MZMO phase structure during the Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;intercalation and deintercalation. The MZMO cathode demonstrates rapid and reversible Zn2+ storage, with a high capacity of 395 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and the capacity remains at 136 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. This study demonstrates Mo and Zn co&#8208;doping is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO2, offering valuable insights for developing other promising cathodes for AZIBs.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Responsive Smart Membrane Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane separation technology is one of the most important techniques in modern separation science. To understand the self&#8208;regulation mechanisms of cell membranes and mimic their working principles, a plethora of artificial membranes with responsive abilities to external stimuli have been engineered and prepared, whose smart sieving functions continue to attract attention and are applied in various fields. Among all the known stimuli, gas as a new trigger mode exhibits certain biocompatibility and offer irreplaceable advantages compared to other stimuli, such as cleanliness, ease&#8208;of&#8208;handling, and non&#8208;destructive, which make gas&#8208;responsive membranes as one of the most promising smart separation materials. In this review, we summarize recent breakthroughs in the development of gas&#8208;responsive membranes, outline the novel strategies on membrane fabrication, and highlight their advanced applications in controlled cargo release, size&#8208;/charge&#8208;based substance separation, oil&#8208;water separation, and selfcleaning. We also outlook the perspectives on the potential research directions and opportunities in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation using bidentate phosphines: How the stereochemistry of the ligand affects the catalyst's activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order is confirmed by the computed apparent Gibbs free energy barrier (57.7, 79.7, and 91.4 kJ mol&#8208;1, respectively). The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to its higher stability compared to the hydride complex and lower stability compared to the CO complex, in contrast to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable polymers from renewable resources have been gaining importance due to their recyclability and reduced environmental impact. However, their development through conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and resource&#8208;intensive. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in polymer science, enabling rapid prediction and discovery of new chemicals and materials. In this review, we examine emerging trends in machine learning applications for sustainable polymer development, focusing on catalyst discovery, property optimization, and new polymer design. We analyze unique challenges in applying machine learning to sustainable polymers and evaluate proposed solutions, providing insights for future development in this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of the cis&#8208;Eunicellane Cyclase AriE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Eunicellane diterpenoids, with over 360 known examples characterized by a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;6/10&#8208;bicyclic carbon skeleton, exhibit diverse biological activities. To date, five eunicellane cyclases (ECs) have been reported: cis&#8208;ECs (Bnd4, CpDTS2 and EcTPS1) and trans&#8208;ECs (AlbS and MicA), yet the structural basis and molecular mechanisms governing their distinct cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;cyclization modes remain unsolved. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cis&#8208;EC AriE from Amycolatopsis arida, which catalyzes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form cis&#8208;6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene (1) in aridacin biosynthesis. Through surface entropy reduction, we obtained the 1.87 &#197; resolution structure of AriED128A. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis identified W73 as a key regulatory hotspot controlling product diversity, with its variants generating diverse diterpene products. Y203A converted AriE into a highly specific (&#8211;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;cembrene A synthase. Our findings provide the first structural insights into this type of terpene synthase and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering EC variants for selective product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Benzyl&#8208;Naphthalimide Dyes Revealing Diverse Structural Evolution Dynamics at The Single&#8208;Assembly Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for in situ monitoring of self&#8208;assembly dynamics, providing critical insights into structural evolution and functional potential. However, the inherent complexity of supramolecular systems presents significant challenges for real&#8208;time visualization, particularly in capturing the growth kinetics of individual assemblies and the hierarchical formation of network structures at the single&#8208;assembly level. Here, we visualized the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In situ time&#8208;lapse imaging revealed distinct dynamic growth mechanisms among the three assemblies. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that different amino substituents significantly influenced assembly morphologies by modulating the planarity of the naphthalene ring. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging revealed pronounced intra&#8208;assembly heterogeneity, highlighting diverse molecular packing arrangements within individual assemblies. The confocal in situ visualization technique provided single&#8208;assembly growth dynamics, offering insights unattainable through conventional spectroscopic methods. Our work reveals that naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules can self&#8208;assemble into a variety of distinct architectures, underscoring their potential for designing advanced functional materials with tunable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistically Designed Carbon&#8208;Free MoS2/MoO2 Heterostructure Anodes with Interfacial Covalent Bonds for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The study designs a carbon&#8208;free MoS2/MoO2 heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces and strong chemical bonding. The formed S&#9472;O bonds generate an internal built&#8208;in electric field, endowing the heterostructure with metallic conductivity and high Na+ adsorption energy. The rational structural design ensures fast reaction kinetics and a stable heterointerface, enabling superior high&#8208;rate Na+&#8208;ion storage performance.








Abstract
The development of hierarchical heterostructured materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains hindered by suboptimal high&#8208;rate cycling performance, primarily due to phase interface pulverization and separation during charge&#8211;discharge processes. To address these challenges, we designed a carbon&#8208;free hierarchical structure comprising few&#8208;layered MoS&#8322; nanosheets and MoO&#8322; nanocrystals through precise compositional optimization and rational structural engineering. The heterogeneous components are interconnected through robust S&#9472;O covalent bonds, which theoretical calculations and experimental results confirm generate a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerfaces, significantly enhancing reaction kinetics. Crucially, these covalent bonds stabilize the heterointerfaces, improving structural integrity and mitigating electrode material agglomeration and pulverization. Additionally, the MoS&#8322;/MoO&#8322; heterostructure enhances Na&#8314; adsorption energetics and reduces Na&#8314; diffusion barriers, facilitating efficient ion transport. Leveraging its abundant heterointerfaces and stable architecture, the composite delivers exceptional rate performance (432.7 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&#185; at 10 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding cycling stability (nearly 100% capacity retention over 400 cycles at 5 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;). This work provides a strategic framework for designing heterostructured materials with stable interface&#8208;rich architectures, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance conversion/alloy&#8208;type anodes for energy storage applications.

         <title>Osteosarcoma Cell and Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Immunogenic Bi&#8208;Nuclear Gallium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current treatment options are unable to benefit the majority of osteosarcoma patients with metastasized tumors (70&#8211;80% 5&#8208;year fatality rate). Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs), a small sub&#8208;population of osteosarcoma cells with stem cell&#8208;like properties, are thought to play a role in the spread of osteosarcoma. In this manuscript, we report the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response toward both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.








Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, anti&#8208;osteosarcoma and anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cells (OSC) properties (cytotoxic and immunogenic) of a series of bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes with tridentate Schiff base ligands and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (1&#8211;4). According to monolayer cytotoxicity studies, 1&#8211;4 display micromolar potency toward bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs. The most effective complex in series 2 is up to 13&#8208;fold more potent toward OSCs than cisplatin and carboplatin (the only metallodrugs used in the clinic to treat osteosarcoma). Remarkably, the bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8211;4 are significantly more potent toward 3D&#8208;cultured sarcospheres than OSCs cultured in monolayers indicating effective penetration of the sarcosphere multicellular architecture. The bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8211;4 are up to 53&#8208;fold more potent toward sarcospheres than cisplatin and carboplatin. Mechanistic studies show that gallium(III) complex 2 kills osteosarcoma cells by caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis and paraptosis, leading to the release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns associated with immunogenic cell death. Osteosarcoma cells and OSCs treated with gallium(III) complex 2 are effectively phagocytosed by immune cells, highlighting its immunogenic potential. As far as it is known, gallium(III) complex 2 is the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response toward both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis, characterization, anti-osteosarcoma and anti-osteosarcoma stem cells (OSC) properties (cytotoxic and immunogenic) of a series of bi-nuclear gallium(III) complexes with tridentate Schiff base ligands and 8-hydroxyquinoline (1&#8211;4). According to monolayer cytotoxicity studies, 1&#8211;4 display micromolar potency toward bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.

The bi-nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8211;4 are up to 53-fold more potent toward sarcospheres than cisplatin and carboplatin. Mechanistic studies show that gallium(III) complex 2 kills osteosarcoma cells by caspase-dependent apoptosis and paraptosis, leading to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns associated with immunogenic cell death. Osteosarcoma cells and OSCs treated with gallium(III) complex 2 are effectively phagocytosed by immune cells, highlighting its immunogenic potential.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;induced C&#8208;C Bond Cleavage for the Construction of Ketone Using Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds by photocatalysis with the participation of oxygen for ketone synthesis and drug derivatization is reported. In this oxidation&#8208;based ketone formation reaction, molecular oxygen complexes with the substrate, which is subsequently photoexcited to generate a charge transfer (CT) state. This CT state facilitates energy transfer with molecular oxygen, producing singlet oxygen, which facilitates hydrogen atom process and promotes the subsequent cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond, ultimately leading to the formation of aryl ketone compounds. 48 aryl ketone compounds and pharmaceutical derivatives were synthesized using this method. A notable feature of this reaction is its catalyst&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free, and transition metals&#8208;free nature, combined with green, mild, and environmentally friendly reaction conditions, enabling high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies towards synthesis and conversion of lignin model compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The push towards a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature and what the product streams identified are. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Octahedral Aluminium Sites on Guest Molecule Adsorption in Zeolites: A Computational Study of 5&#8208;Fluorouracil in Zeolite FAU</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many aluminosilicate zeolites contain octahedral aluminium sites, which may occur as extra&#8208;framework or framework&#8208;associated sites. Due to the Lewis acidity of these sites, their impact on catalytic properties has been investigated frequently. Comparatively less emphasis has been placed on their role in adsorption, despite evidence for an irreversible binding of some guest molecules like the anticancer drug 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) to octahedral Al atoms. In the present study, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT&#8208;based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) are employed to investigate the adsorption of 5&#8208;FU at a framework&#8208;associated octahedral Al site in zeolite FAU. The calculations show that 5&#8208;FU remains coordinated to the Al atom at room temperature and in the presence of water. In contrast, 5&#8208;FU molecules adsorbed at framework protons are quickly displaced by water molecules. It is thus demonstrated that octahedral Al atoms will negatively affect the release of 5&#8208;FU from zeolite hosts in drug delivery applications. A comparison of DFT&#8208;calculated infrared (IR) spectra to literature data provides evidence that Al&#8208;coordinated 5&#8208;FU molecules were indeed present in previously investigated samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihalogens Binding and Activation by Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Chalcogenone Model Derivatives: Insight from a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline&#8208;based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X = Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI) and a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY). The halogen and chalcogen effects are discussed separately as for the solvation effects. Furthermore, only the TY species formed from the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione and I2 resulted to be disfavored with respect to the corresponding CT adduct; therefore, this peculiarity is rationalized in the framework of activation strain analysis. Lastly, a possible alternative mechanism involving the formation of a cationic intermediate species is considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate for Disulfide Bond Formation of Peptide under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing an efficient method for the synthesis of disulfide bonds in peptides is an important challenge for the further development of several research fields, including peptide&#8208;based medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine (Npy) sulfenate that efficiently forms intramolecular disulfide bonds in reduced peptides. Moreover, Npy&#8208;sulfenate formed a disulfide bond in a thiol&#8208;containing peptide prepared by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free native chemical ligation, as demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin, which contains 52 amino acid residues. This study provides a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for preparing mid&#8208;sized cyclic disulfide peptides via sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance the surface reactivity of Mo&#8208;based TMD monolayers &#8211; MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 &#8211; but also amplify differences in their physicochemical properties, leading to distinct surface interactions. This effect originates from the intrinsic characteristics of Mo&#8211;X bonding in these monolayers.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of 

MoS2

 ${{\rm{MoS}}_2 }$



, 

MoSe2

 ${{\rm{MoSe}}_2 }$



, and 

MoTe2

 ${{\rm{MoTe}}_2 }$



, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and 

NO2

 ${{\rm{NO}}_2 }$



. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of Ag&#8208;based electrode with the highly exposed and tightly contacted AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) active facets was constructed for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work can help understand the effects of crystal orientation and crystal face interface on electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x=0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 456&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

We present a bivalent iridium(III) complex toolkit for targeting mitochondrial DNA Gquadruplexes, which has the merits of multicolor, ability to discriminate TNBC cells and modular phototheranostics.







Abstract
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4&#8197;s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, where complex 3 exhibited a type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.

         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method is developed for the hydrofunctionalization of olefins, involving TEMPO adduct formation followed by photocatalytic nucleophilic substitution. This approach enables the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bonds with high efficiency. The method demonstrates potential for PET applications with hydrofluorination and offers an alternative pathway to diastereoselective olefin hydration.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.

         <title>Reusable CuO NPs Catalyzed Chemodivergent Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes and Aniline Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy to synthesize CuO NPs catalyzed effective chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to aniline derivatives and hydrazoarenes under mild conations using ammonia borane is demonstrated. A series of control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were carried out to understand the catalytic process. Furthermore, the catalyst was recycled up to six consecutive cycles with no significant decrease in catalytic activity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of different products from a substrate employing a single catalyst by altering the reaction conditions is challenging. Herein, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and cheap CuO NPs catalyzed chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes and aniline derivatives using ammonia borane (AB) under mild conditions is disclosed. The practical applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrazo and aniline derivatives as well as by the reduction of a few commercially used dyes such as methyl red, sudan I, sudan III and solvent yellow 7. Several control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Accelerating Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand Displacement Reaction using Polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) is an effective accelerator for toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. PQ2 improves reaction rates by up to 105&#8208;fold and alleviates dependence on toehold length, mitigates secondary structure's influences, and ensures robust performance in serum. PQ2 offers a promising solution for advancing applications of DNA nanotechnology, from biosensing to molecular computing.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially for low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator of TMSD reaction. We show that PQ2 could drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold. Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with sub&#8208;nanomolar input has been demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic DNA amplifiers. By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations, PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes. The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride with Cerium&#8208;Aluminum Catalytic Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a cerium&#8208;aluminum bimetallic catalyst is fired using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, and a modified carbon fabric anode is created. Electrochemical degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride without additional oxidizing agents shows excellent results. Simultaneously, several cycle degradation studies yield outstanding results, and a degradation mechanism was presented by characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85&#8201;% removal efficiency of DOX within 2&#8197;hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82&#8201;%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8211;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene (AB) is a promising light&#8208;responsive motif for targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) and enabling their light&#8208;controlled modulation. We synthesized a series of novel AB derivatives with diverse structural variations, demonstrating that the interaction mode influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings highlight critical design principles for optimizing photoactive G4 ligands.







Abstract
During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4&#8197;s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.

         <title>The Chemistry of Anticancer Mononuclear and N&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Half&#8208;sandwich Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
8&#8208;Aminoquinoline half&#8208;sandwich metal chlorido complexes were found to undergo conversion into dimetallic analogues under basic conditions and/or by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were found to be in general more potent than the mononuclear analogues which can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells.







Abstract
Piano&#8208;stool complexes of ruthenium and other platinum group metals have shown promising preclinical results as anticancer agents, often with alternative modes of action to traditional platinum&#8208;based compounds. Quinoline is considered a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and many complexes with potent anticancer activity have been reported. To assess the effect of incorporating bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQH) ligands in half&#8208;sandwich piano&#8208;stool metal complexes of the general formula [M(L)(AQH)Cl]+, the respective Ru, Os (L=&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene), Rh and Ir (L=&#951;5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes were prepared.

&lt;p&gt;8-Aminoquinoline half-sandwich metal chlorido complexes were found to undergo conversion into dimetallic analogues under basic conditions and/or by the addition of AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to abstract the chlorido ligand. In &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were found to be in general more potent than the mononuclear analogues which can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piano-stool complexes of ruthenium and other platinum group metals have shown promising preclinical results as anticancer agents, often with alternative modes of action to traditional platinum-based compounds. Quinoline is considered a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and many complexes with potent anticancer activity have been reported. To assess the effect of incorporating bidentate 8-aminoquinoline-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N-1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N-8&lt;/i&gt; (AQH) ligands in half-sandwich piano-stool metal complexes of the general formula [M(L)(AQH)Cl]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the respective Ru, Os (L=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene), Rh and Ir (L=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes were prepared. Deprotonation of AQH during the reaction gave dinuclear [M(L)(AQ)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with the deprotonated &#956;-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N-8&lt;/i&gt;-aminoquinolinato-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N-1&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N-8&lt;/i&gt; (AQ) ligands acting as bridges between the metal centers. Conversion of the mononuclear Ru, Rh and Ir compounds to the dimetallic analogues was facilitated under basic conditions and improved for the Ru derivative by the addition of AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to abstract the chlorido ligand.

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>

Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.&#8201;e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Organic Batteries using Renewable Biomolecule&#8208;Based Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based molecule (emodin) have been utilized for the first time as cathode in rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), exhibiting high specific capacity and excellent diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) exhibit significant potential in large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their features of high volumetric capacity, resistance to dendrite formation, and abundant magnesium resources. However, the high polarity of divalent Mg2+ ions results in sluggish diffusion kinetics in conventional inorganic cathode materials, adversely affecting reversible capacity and rate performance. Organic materials such as pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrone (PTO) and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), achieve rapid and reversible intercalation of magnesium ions through carbonyl enolization, but these materials are challenged by high cost, complex preparation, and poor environmental friendliness. In this study, we employ a carbonyl&#8208;rich biomass&#8208;based small molecule, emodin, as a cathode material for RMBs, achieving rapid diffusion kinetics and notable magnesium storage performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using biomass materials to prepare high&#8208;performance cathodes for RMBs and provides a novel approach for the development of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials.

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a 2nd sphere hydrogen bond donor in iron complexes induces the selection of a specific FeIIIOOH species in the presence of H2O2 thanks to the stabilizing H&#8208;bonding interaction with the proximal O. This structural pattern, after OO bond cleavage, enhances the electrophilicity of the resulting high valent oxo species, which improves epoxidation yields.







Abstract
Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo&#8208;containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis&#8208;zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the E to the Z configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.







Abstract
Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the plier can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the rotor.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis-zinc-porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo-containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis-zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light-triggered, scissor-like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open-close motion of the plier upon light-activated isomerization from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light-induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, UV-Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open-close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light-triggered conformational alterations of the plier can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the rotor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Crystal structures of Cu&#8208;MOF: by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photochromic ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photochromic copper&#8208;based MOF using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photochromic ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture (see picture). The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;stimulated Polymers have garnered significant attention for their potential applications ranging from optical memory to sensing. Herein, by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photo&#8208;stimulated ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photo&#8208;stimulated copper&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;MOF) using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture, offering a distinct advantage over previously reported 1D coordination polymer using similar photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor. Its electrochemical performance revealed high reversibility, with discharge capacities retaining stability under varying current densities. Additionally, the Cu&#8208;MOF displayed notable photo&#8208;stimulated behavior under UV light irradiation, enhancing its optical properties. Although the structure changes from 1D coordination polymer to 3D MOF, the photocyclized form (c&#8208;Cu MOF) still exhibited superior fluorescence quenching efficiency and sensitivity for MnO&#8324;&#8722; detection with Ksv (quenching constant) 5.24&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. This work highlights the utility of Cu&#8208;MOF as a multifunctional material for energy storage and environmental sensing applications.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation by improving stability and scalability. Through topotactic proton replacement with metal ions in bpy&#8208;pillared zincophosphates, a bimetal phosphate, VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w, was developed, showing exceptional stability (pH 2&#8211;12, boiling water). A rapid synthesis reduced production time to 3&#8197;hours, with vanadyl groups providing strong sheets and metal sites for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8901;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH&#8197;2&#8208;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48&#8197;hours to just 3&#8197;hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.

Specific ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembly is achieved using box&#8208;like molecules and hydrogen bonded aramide macrocycle through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions, revealing the importance of the effect of molecular structures and conformational adaptivity upon the assembling outcome.







Abstract
The controlled formation of ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) assemblies is highly desirable as precursors for constructing higher order supramolecular architectures. We report our findings that this goal can be achieved by balancing molecular structures and conformational adaptivity through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions. With hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules including naph&#8208;Box, m&#8208;Box and p4p&#8208;Box, ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling systems with 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry are preferentially created. The formation of such assemblies with a defined number of rings threaded on a Box molecule is unprecedented using 2D shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles. The unusual assembly behaviors are rationalized by the aid of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and xTB computation. In sharp contrast to the use of o&#8208;Box and p&#8208;Box in forming ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings complexes where a distribution of various assembled species is observed, the box&#8208;like molecules all afford monodisperse compact assemblies. Conformational adaptivity is deemed as one of the major factors that is accountable for the selectivity observed, which is driven mainly by cooperative action of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions including H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Using pyrimidyl&#8208;incorporated H&#8208;bonded macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling structures may provide opportunities for designing more sophisticated and topologically unique supramolecular systems with potential functions.

         <title>Tuning Decomposition Temperature: A Structural Study of Ligand Directed Bonding and Fluxionality</title>

In this work, we have investigated the design and synthesis of aluminium compounds via systematic variation of ligand type. This is the first example of a ligand directed design and study of aluminium compounds which decompose at low temperatures (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C). Their dynamic properties have also been investigated, with a focus on the decomposition profiles.







Abstract
In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#8201;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8722;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8722;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R=Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8722;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14. This has directly been linked to the decomposition profiles of the compounds to assess their viability as precursors, evidencing that what we see in the solution state is present in the solid state too. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to elucidate the various bonding modes observed for compounds 1&#8211;7. Tandem MS has been employed to better understand the breakdown of the molecules.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Conjugation of Inorganic Phosphate and Sulfate with Aminocyclobutenediones under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation of aminocyclobutenediones with blue light in aqueous phosphate or sulfate solution produces butenolides with phosphate or sulfate groups. The reaction is compatible with free amino and carboxy groups, and can be performed under air.







Abstract
Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented. In this study, we have successfully conjugated inorganic phosphate and sulfate with aminocyclobutenedione derivatives via photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. A plausible mechanism for the conjugation reactions was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations. These reactions will promote life science research based on organophosphates and organosulfates which have been difficult to access up to now.

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;Shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;Free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes by templating with Ag nanocubes via one&#8208;shot injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution and H2O2 etching. We also extend the one&#8208;shot synthesis from a batch to a continuous flow reactor for continuous production without compromising the quality.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.

         <title>Working Mechanisms for Enhanced Interface Stability and Electrochemical Properties in Dual&#8208;Salt Polymer Electrolyte with In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte&#8208;Cathode Integration</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;salt CSEs with electrolyte&#8208;cathode integrated structure is obtained via in&#8208;situ UV photopolymerization. The working mechanisms of a stable, robust and low&#8208;resistance SEI layer can be revealed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterization. The dual&#8208;salt CSEs show an enhanced performance for all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li||Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2&#8201;% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000&#8197;h at at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2@0.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4||Li cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C after 100 cycles) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.

With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low-resistance solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li||Li symmetric cells with RTS-TH-2&#8201;% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000&#8197;h at at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;@0.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C after 100 cycles) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)-based electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;Heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy adsorption separation method is proposed, which uses cucurbit[7]uril to efficiently separate toluene from toluene/n&#8208;heptane mixture with a purity of 99.65&#8201;% and can be reused, providing an innovative solution for the efficient utilization of petroleum resources.







Abstract
Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38&#8201;% from the mixed vapors and 99.65&#8201;% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.

         <title>The Cooperation of Pd center and Lewis Acid Sites to Achieve High Selectivity Towards Kinetic Carbonate Product for Oxidative Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model catalysts, those are, Pd1@NaY with conjuct Pd center and Lewis acid sites, and Pd1@NaY&#8722;T with isolated Pd centers are synthesized and compared their catalytic performance for oxidative carbonylation reaction. Combined in&#8208;situ DRIFTS, and DFT calculation study reveals the cooperation mechanism of Pd and Lewis acid sites towards the carbonate products.







Abstract
Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in&#8197;situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate significant potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. This work systematically evaluates four synthesis strategies &#8211; solvothermal, microwave, ultrasonic, and mechanochemical &#8211; to optimize TAPT&#8208;COF preparation, showing how different synthesis methods influence COF properties, and providing valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30&#8197;min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, decomposition of solvents and sacrificial agents leads to CH4 production rather than CO2 reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed that acetone, DMSO, and TEA decompose to produce CH4 at rates as high as 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.

Self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode materials with vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies were prepared by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method, and synergistically interacted with SnO&#8322;&#8208;modified SnO&#8322;/CNTs anode materials to successfully construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors.

Abstract
In this work, we present for the first time an innovative strategy to construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors through the synergistic optimization of vanadium&#8208;doped self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional Flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anodes and SnO&#8322;/CNTs composite anodes. The V&#8208;doped Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode synthesized by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method combines vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies, lattice distortion effects and self&#8208;supporting properties of the three&#8208;dimensional floral structure, which enhances the specific surface area of the material to 190.58&#8197;m2/g, and obtains a high specific capacitance of 2,157&#8197;F/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g, and undergoes a 15&#8197;A/g After 10,000 cycles at 15&#8197;A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still 98.2&#8201;%. To address the limitations of traditional anode materials, SnO&#8322;/CNTs composites significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance (5.61&#8197;&#937;) and enhance the multiplicity performance by combining the high theoretical capacity of SnO&#8322; with the three&#8208;dimensional conductive network of CNTs. Based on this, the V&#8722;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs hybrid supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 151&#8197;Wh/kg at 3&#8197;A/g, which is a 30&#8211;60&#8201;% enhancement over the conventional molybdate capacitor, and maintains 96.2&#8201;% capacitance stability after 10,000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the development of energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycle life.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Development of a Covalent Inhibitor Targeting Streptococcus Pyogenes over Staphylococcus Aureus Sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

The rational design of a selective SpSrtA inhibitor was guided by structural insights from the ML346/SpSrtA structure and the docked ML346/SaSrtA model. Our analysis revealed that head and tail clashes in the binding pocket indicated that reducing the &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in ML346 could enhance selectivity for SpSrtA over SaSrtA. Through our SAR study, we identified T10 as a promising narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agent for combating S.&#8197;pyogenes infection.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10&#8242;s covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: The Missing Link in the 3&#8201;d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

Covalent or Lewis&#8208;Pair? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; and Mn2(CO)10 yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)10]+. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis&#8208;pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.







Abstract
The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cage complex is presented that mimics the CuD site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). The CuD site has recently been proposed to be the activite site of pMMO. The cage complex presented here can catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones.







Abstract
The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase (pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD site with two histidines and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Salen&#8208;Type Chromium Complexes for Selective Carbonylation of Epoxides: A Pathway to Polyesters and Cyclic Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates epoxide carbonylation using salen&#8208;type complexes with Co2(CO)8 to optimize the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) favoured polyesters, while [ONNO]&#8208;type Cr(III) and Al(III) favoured cyclic lactones. Ethylene oxide carbonylation highlighted the role of catalyst structure, with the [ONNO] type achieving &gt;99% propiolactone selectivity. The results emphasize the influence of ligand design on selectivity, thus facilitating the development of catalytic systems.







Abstract
Carbonylation, a pivotal process in efficient C1 conversion, facilitates the direct incorporation of carbon monoxide into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. This study investigates the carbonylation of epoxides using salen&#8208;type complexes with varying metal centers and tetradentate dianionic ligands, in conjunction with Co2(CO)8, to optimize selectivity and yield in the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. The [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) complexes exhibited a pronounced preference for polyester formation, achieving a selectivity of 73&#8201;%. This preference is attributed to the electron&#8208;donating sulfur donors, which stabilize the growing polymer chain. In contrast, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) predominantly yielded cyclic lactones (99&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone selectivity), owing to their enhanced electrophilicity that favors the backbiting process. Detailed analyses of ethylene oxide carbonylation underscored the crucial role of catalyst structure in determining reaction pathways and product distribution. Notably, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) exhibited over 99&#8201;% propiolactone selectivity during the carbonylation of ethylene oxide, highlighting the significance of catalyst design in optimizing chemical reactions. These results provide valuable insights into the role of ligand design in controlling the selectivity and efficiency of epoxide carbonylation, paving the way for the development of more effective catalytic systems.

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>

Can hypergolic ionic liquid &#8211; oxidizer combination be universal green propellant? Comprehensive experimental study exploiting droplet merging technique inside an acoustic levitator process chamber reveals such feasibility via comparing the hypergolic and atmospheric ignition reactions through the identification of products and reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternatives to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8901;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8901;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>

         <dc:description>
Supported AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, Au&#8722;Pd Janus particle and Au+Pd mixture catalysts with different configurations were prepared to selectively oxidize GLY toward DHA, in which AuPd/CNT catalyst with the strongest interaction between the Au and Pd atoms afforded the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms. That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Au atoms remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au, resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly. After optimizing, up to 61&#8201;% yield of DHA was achieved at 87&#8201;% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowest&#8208;lying excited states of the TTM&#8208;derived diradicals cannot be related to those of TTM: new low&#8208;lying excited states emerge, corresponding to charge resonance between the two radical units, the lowest one being a dark state for symmetric diradicals. Different approaches than those used for TTM radicals are needed to achieve high PLQY in TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.







Abstract
The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is characterized by the H,H&#8594;L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogs with shifted double bonds were synthesized and together with the known analog iso&#8208;GGPP I converted with 14 diterpene synthases. While two substrate analogs were not accepted by the enzymes, the other three analogs yielded compounds with skeletons that are not observed in nature. Mechanistic key steps were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and computational chemistry.







Abstract
Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.

The molecular structures of the complexes [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; and [MnFe(CO)10]+ complete the series of dimetal decacarbonyls reaching from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+. In our interpretation of the Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, a chemist is hiking through the dimetal&#8208;decacarbonyl landscape, discovering the hidden heterodinuclear complexes in the fog. The fog also highlights the misty borderline situation between covalent and Lewis&#8208;pair bonding, onto which light is ornately shed. In the background, the vibrational mountain range of the title compound shows its peaks. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Krossing and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500489).

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;Activated Luminescence for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) is a versatile platform that enables simultaneous optical imaging and tumor phototherapy, offering significant potential to bridge the gap between radiotheranostics and phototheranostics. This review presents diverse RL probes categorized by their activation mechanisms, emphasizes their applications in cancer theranostics, and provides a comprehensive insight into RL technology to accelerate its clinical translation.







Abstract
Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in&#8197;vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO2 other energy&#8208;related processes, and future research directions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n&#8208;&#960;* transitions to further advance g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n&#8208;&#960;* transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the employment of rotaxane and pseudorotaxane architecture in the controlled release of target molecules both in solution and in the solid state. The properties conferred by the mechanical bond allow precise control over the release mechanism, thus leading to new forms of molecular cargo delivery when rotaxane&#8208;based systems are employed.







Abstract
The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.

         <title>Endowing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Induced Supramolecular Chirality by Engineering Cation&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; co&#8208;assembly were fabricated, primarily driven by cation&#8208;&#960; interaction between electron&#8208;poor chiral cationic polymer R/S&#8208;Pd and electron&#8208;rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAs). This cation&#8208;&#960; co&#8208;assembly can derive into 12 different PAHs and observed induced supramolecular chiral transfer in the PAHs observed both in DMSO solution and THF/H2O (v/v, 6/4) supramolecular gel matrices.







Abstract
The cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is a crucial noncovalent binding force prevalent in many biological and chemical systems, however, are rarely reported in chiral supramolecular systems. Here, a supramolecular chiral system is reported, wherein cation&#8208;&#960; interaction play significant roles. The interaction involves a chiral cationic palladium complex (R&#8208;Pd) co&#8208;assembling with 12 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in the formation of supramolecular gels in mixed solvents. This co&#8208;assembly induces supramolecular chirality in the PAHs, with cation&#8722;&#960; interaction identified as the primary driving force. The confirmation of this interaction is supported by high&#8208;resolution mass, 1H NMR, nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), XRD and CD. Most importantly, with the synergy of hydrogen bonds, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction can be stabilized in a mixed solvent containing water, leading the co&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular gel, as well as enhanced chiral induction of PAHs. This discovery serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle example showing how the weak cation&#8208;&#960; interaction could be a powerful guide in attaining induced chirality of PAHs.

         <title>Chiral Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Antimony Chloride with Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Solvent&#8208;Induced Property Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN, demonstrate efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), a maximum |glum| of 2.27&#215;10&#8722;3. Solvent molecules play a crucial role in modulating their structural and chiroptical properties. Their CPL&#8208;emitting devices and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications highlight the potential of these materials for advanced chiral optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
In this study, we synthesized two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN, which exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions with distinct optical properties influenced by the solvent environment. (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF displays bright orange luminescence with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 57.1&#8201;%, while (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN emits red luminescence with a PLQY of 17.4&#8201;%. Notably, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN achieves a maximum dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.27&#215;10&#8722;3, attributed to strong hydrogen bonding between organic and inorganic components. Reversible transformations between these two phases via solvent vapor stimulation enable dynamic photoluminescence (PL) switching, highlighting their application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. Furthermore, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting devices (CPL&#8208;emitting devices) based on these materials were fabricated, achieving a maximum |glum| of 2.01&#215;10&#8722;3. These findings underscore the potential of these chiral HMHs for advanced applications in chiral optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and CPL&#8208;emitting devices.

Metal&#8208;ligand electronic synergy driven stabilization of MLCT excited state in unsymmetric azoheteroaromatic radical bridged diruthenium (III) complex 2 (S=1/2) incorporating electron rich acac (acetylacetonate) co&#8208;ligand has been demonstrated via synthetic architecture and structural/spectroscopic authentication.







Abstract
The article demonstrated the stabilization of MLCT excited state in structurally characterized unsymmetric N,N/N,O&#8722; donating azoheteroaromatic radical bridged (acac)2RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L3&#8226;&#8722;)RuIII(acac)2 (2, S=1/2) [L3= deprotonated 5&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;(6&#8208;methybenzo[d] thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)diazenylphenol, acac= electron rich acetylacetonate, N&#8722;N(azo) distance: 1.379(4) &#197;] via intramolecular electron transfer (IET) at the metal&#8208;azo interface. On the contrary, similar IET driven stabilization of MLCT excited state was failed to take place in N,N donating HL3 derived mononuclear counterpart (acac)2RuII(HL3) (1, S=0) with unperturbed azo function (N=N distance: 1.3361(18) &#197;) in spite of the fact of facile RuII/RuIII oxidation (0.28&#8197;V versus SCE) and azo reduction (&#8722;1.05&#8197;V versus SCE), presumably due to the influence of hydrogen bonding interaction at the back face of coordinated HL3. On the other hand, the use of electron poor bpy (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) as a co&#8208;ligand facilitated exclusive generation of the mononuclear [(bpy)2RuIIL3]ClO4 ([3]ClO4, S=0) encompassing N,O&#8722;&#8208;donating L3 with neutral azo group (N=N distance: 1.317(6) &#197;), unlike N,N donating HL3 in 1 due to the impact of &#963;&#8208;donating acac versus &#960;&#8208;accepting bpy, which also devoided of IET step. DFT calculations further suggested the origin of multiple redox steps and absorption profiles of 1, 2, 3+.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions of Surface Adsorbed Species Control the Self&#8208;Assembly of Calcinated Nickel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in polar&#8208; and non&#8208;polar&#8208;faceted NiO nanoparticles (NPs) are explained using diffraction, imaging and 2D correlation spectroscopic techniques. NiO NPs with dominating (100) surface planes show pronounced self&#8208;assembling tendency due to favorable non&#8208;covalent interactions between non&#8208;dissociatively adsorbed water molecules, while those with dominating polar (111) surface planes behave oppositely, due to unfavorable interactions between surface hydroxyl groups.







Abstract
Utilizing state of the art diffraction, imaging and spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with two&#8208;dimensional correlation analysis, we provide novel in&#8208;depth insights into the physics and chemistry behind the different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in NiO nanoparticles as function of their surface facets. We demonstrate substantially different temperature dependence of the spectroscopic behavior of the two types of NiO NPs, polar versus non&#8208;polar faceted. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy data for NiO NPs obtained by the ammonia route are consistent with the process in which high amount of water molecules that take part in hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction with the surface&#8208;adsorbed non&#8208;dissociated water molecules on the neutral (100) planes are lost during the thermal treatment and attached back upon cooling. Interactions between water molecules adsorbed on two vicinal NiO NPs are responsible for keeping the self&#8208;assembly of the Ni(OH)2 NPs upon heat treatment. In carbamide&#8208;based NiO NPs, the self&#8208;assembly of initially formed Ni3(OH)4(NO3)2 NPs is not preserved. These NPs are terminated with polar (111) atomic planes, on which water molecules dissociatively adsorb, giving surface hydroxyl groups. As the hydrogen bonding proton &#8211; donating and accepting abilities are negligible at OH&#8208;polar terminated NiO NPs, only unfavorable inter&#8208;NP interactions are possible which leads to disruption of the NP assembly.

         <title>Diboron Reagents in N&#8722;N Bond Cleavage of Hydrazines, N&#8208;Nitrosamines, and Azides: Reactivity and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron) (B2nep2) efficiently cleaves N&#8722;N bonds in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides through alkoxide activation. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and operationally simple protocol yields amines (or amides in the case of azides) in an environmentally friendly way. Both experimental and theoretical studies suggest a non&#8208;radical but concerted mechanism, involving simultaneous B&#8722;B and N&#8722;N bond cleavage.







Abstract
Diboron reagents are known for their ability to promote the deoxygenation of amine or pyridine oxides, nitroarenes, and nitrones through the formation of B&#8722;O&#8722;B bonds. In this study, we have investigated the potential of diboron reagents to induce N&#8722;N bond cleavage in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides. Our findings show that the combination of B2nep2 as diboron source and KOMe as a Lewis base can effectively promote the N&#8722;N cleavage of a wide variety of substrates. For hydrazines and nitrosamines, the presence of an aryl group is essential for the reaction to proceed, probably due to a better stabilization of the negative charge developed during N&#8722;N bond cleavage. Both types of azides, aromatic and aliphatic, are easily reduced, and the resulting amines can be in&#8197;situ converted into the corresponding amides by simple treatment with a carboxylic acid. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest a non&#8208;radical mechanism, with concerted B&#8722;B and N&#8722;N bond cleavage in the case of hydrazines and azides, and a stepwise mechanism in the case of N&#8208;nitrosamines, where deoxygenation occurs as the first step, involving the formation of an N&#8208;nitrene intermediate.

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;Deformylation Cascade Catalyzed By a Mononuclear Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired copper complex is able to catalyze two successive oxidative steps of alcohol conversion in the presence of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Isotopic effects on the reaction rates indicate that hydrogen atom abstraction is rate limiting for both steps.







Abstract
In this study, two copper complexes were synthesized using N3 (arising from two pyridines and one amide group) containing ligands N&#8208;(2&#8208;picolyl)picolinamide (L1H) and bis(2&#8208;pyridylcarbonyl)amine (L2H), forming [(L1)CuII(OH2)(NO3)] (1) and [(L2)CuII(OH2)2](NO3) (2). The reaction of complex 1 with hydrogen peroxide in alcoholic solvents yielded a formate&#8208;bound complex. Studies with isotopically labeled 13C ethanol indicated that formate originates from the C1 of ethanol after C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Complex 1 was found to catalytically convert primary alcohols into formic acid probably following a two&#8208;step process: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Further experiments with 2&#8208;phenylpropionaldehyde (2&#8208;PPA) confirm the ability of complex 1 to catalyze aldehyde deformylation. Both steps of the reaction are associated with significant kinetic deuterium isotope effects (KDIE), suggesting that hydrogen atom abstractions (HAA) occur during the rate&#8208;determining steps of both conversions. Overall, this system proposes a clean catalytic process for alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;formic acid conversion, operating under mild conditions, and offering potential synthetic applications.

         <title>An Oxoiron(IV) Complex Supported by an N&#8208;Alkylated Cyclam Ligand System Containing a Pendant Alcohol Moiety</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the pendant atom present in the N&#8208;alkylated cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) based ligand framework, substantially altered conformations of the non&#8208;heme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are revealed.







Abstract
The effect of a pendant neutral alcohol moiety in the N&#8208;alkylated cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) ligand backbone is examined for the non&#8208;heme mononuclear oxoiron(IV) unit in [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC&#8208;HOR)(NCCH3)]2+ (1&#8208;syn) (TMC&#8208;HOR=2&#8208;(4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecan1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol). Unlike in the related [FeIV(Oanti)(TMC&#8208;SR)]+ (3&#8208;anti) (TMC&#8208;SR=1&#8208;mercaptoethyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) complex, bearing an axial mono&#8208;anionic thiolate ligand trans to the oxo unit, the alcohol moiety in 1&#8208;syn stays protonated and does not axially coordinate to iron. The protonation of the alcohol moiety is a prerequisite for the stabilization of the oxoiron(IV) core; it presumably serves as a hydrogen bonding donor to the oxoiron(IV) unit, which is positioned syn to the three methyl groups. Comparative reactivity studies reveal 1&#8208;syn to be a stronger hydrogen atom abstraction but weaker oxygen atom transfer agent relative to the [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC)(NCCH3)]2+ (2&#8208;syn) complex, bearing the N&#8208;tetramethylated cyclam (TMC) ligand.

         <title>The Fluoride Ion Affinity Revisited: Do We Need the Anchor&#8208;Point Approach?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmark of fluoride&#8208;ion affinities has been generated. Its application shows that widely used computational anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions rely on non&#8208;systematic error cancellations and are advantageous only when inappropriate density functionals and/or basis sets without diffuse functions are used. In all other cases direct FIA computations are accurate and preferable.







Abstract
A large and diverse high&#8208;level benchmark data set of computed gas&#8208;phase fluoride ion affinities (FIAs) for 71 small main&#8208;group Lewis acids is presented. It has been used to evaluate quantitatively DFT approaches with 52 functionals and 4 composite methods. Two widely used indirect anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions with fluorophosgene or the trimethyl silyl cation are compared to the direct computation of the FIA. It has been frequently stated that anchor&#8208;point methods are to be strongly preferred over direct FIA computations at DFT levels, as they avoid treatment of the naked fluoride ion. Here it is shown that this widespread assumption does not hold when modern functionals with low self&#8208;interaction errors and suitable basis sets with diffuse functions are used. In these cases, an anchor&#8208;point approach based on 

OCF2

 ${{\rm{OCF}}_2 }$



 has little or no advantage, and the widely used anchor&#8208;point calculations based on 

Me3Si+

 ${{\rm{Me}}_3 {\rm{Si}}^+ }$



 even deteriorate results in most cases. It is shown that this is due to a break&#8208;down of often prevailing error cancellations in the anchor&#8208;point approach that help to improve results when using less suitable functionals or basis sets. Overall, the direct computation of FIAs at appropriate DFT levels including diffuse basis functions is the clearly preferable route.

         <title>Embedding High&#8208;Density Ionic Sites in Porous Aromatic Frameworks via Multivariate Strategy for ReO4&#8722; Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a rational method to link multiple building units using multivariate strategy and form PAFs with high density imidazolium groups. As expected, PAF&#8208;271with higher imidazolium density shows higher adsorption capacity for ReO4&#8722;.







Abstract
Rhenium is a rare and significant metal, making its recovery crucial for resource management. Herein, to address these issues, three porous aromatic frameworks with high&#8208;density ionic sites were successfully synthesized using a multivariate strategy. These MTV&#8208;iPAFs are named PAF&#8208;271, PAF&#8208;272 and PAF&#8208;273, respectively, and were employed for the ultrafast and selective removal of ReO4&#8722;. These materials exhibit varying high specific surface areas, porosities, and imidazolium densities. The results demonstrated that compared to PAF&#8208;272 with low adsorption site density and PAF&#8208;273 with high specific surface area, PAF&#8208;271 with higher imidazolium density exhibited superior performance for ReO4&#8722; adsorption. Specifically, PAF&#8208;271 could remove 98&#8201;% of ReO4&#8722; within 2&#8197;min, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity was 707&#8197;mg g&#8722;1. Moreover, PAF&#8208;271 also had excellent stability, making it highly effective for ReO4&#8722; adsorption under strong acid or alkali, radiation, high anion concentration and even in Hanford simulated waste liquid, it is expected to be applied to adsorb TcO4&#8722;. Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites within PAFs by multivariate strategy result in highly stable and effective ReO4&#8722; disposal approach.

         <title>Syntheses of Structurally Complex Marine Cyclopropyl&#8208;Diterpenoids: Peyssonnoside A and Its Aglycon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report provides a comprehensive account of the development of the first total synthesis of the marine natural product peyssonnoside A. After exploring several approaches that proved unsuccessful, a successful strategy was established, utilizing the Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction to construct the cyclopropane moiety at the core of the natural product.







Abstract
Peyssonnoside A is a marine&#8208;derived sulfated diterpenoid glucoside featuring a remarkable 5/6/3/6 tetracyclic skeleton with a highly substituted cyclopropane ring deeply embedded in its structure. Herein, we report on the full development of the first total synthesis of this natural product and its aglycon, peyssonnosol. Through the experimental evaluation of a series of synthetic strategies, including utilization of Ohloff&#8211;Rautenstrauch cycloisomerization and C&#8722;H allylation, we identified a concise, efficient, and highly diastereoselective route. Key steps in the synthesis of the aglycone peyssonnosol include a Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and a Mukaiyama hydration, both guided by the inherent spatial features of the substrates. This optimized approach enabled the synthesis of peyssonnosol in 12 steps and 21&#8201;% overall yield and provides a robust framework for accessing structurally complex marine natural products.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Assisted Quantum Yield Enhancement and Chromism Activity of 4&#8217;&#8208;Halo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils freezing the axial rotation reduce the nonradiative deactivation pathway to significantly improve the luminescence quantum yields over those for the parent boranils. In a network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, halogen&#8208;bonding, H&#8722;F hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and CH&#8208;&#960; interaction, 4&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranil shows mechanochromism and vapochromism.







Abstract

         <title>Novel Base&#8208;Labile Linkers for Convenient Purification and Functional Group Introduction in Solid&#8208;Phase Glycan Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel base&#8208;labile linkers, synthesized through straightforward chemical methods, yield terminal amines, carboxylic acid groups, and free reducing ends after solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. The phthalate in resin 2 and resin 3 can be cleaved by methanolysis or hydrazinolysis. Using these linkers, nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide were successfully synthesized.







Abstract
Glycans are essential biomolecules across species, but their structure&#8208;property relationships remain poorly understood. Pure oligosaccharide samples are crucial for studying these properties, and their preparation heavily relies on chemical synthesis. The linker used for attaching the oligosaccharide to the solid support is essential during solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. Here, we present three base&#8208;labile linkers compatible with Merrifield resin. The first type of resin, containing a hydroxyhexanoic acid linker, can be prepared in a one&#8208;step synthesis and releases glycans with a terminal carboxylic acid after methanolysis and hydrolysis. Linkers on the second and third types of resin can be synthesized through simple chemical reactions and cleaved to reveal either a free reducing end of the oligosaccharide or a terminal amine with a C5&#8208;spacer. The phthalate structure in the second and third types of resin is sensitive to sodium methoxide and can also be cleaved during hydrazinolysis. Hydrazinolysis, rather than methanolysis, enables the isolation of oligosaccharide with pivaloyl ester protection and facilitates the purification process compared to partially protected compounds. Using these resins, we prepared nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide, including &#945; (1&#8208;6) mannan, &#945; (1&#8208;4) glucan, &#946; (1&#8208;4) glucan, and &#946; (1&#8208;3) glucan. Glycans with terminal functional groups can be converted into glycoconjugates for further applications.

         <title>Directional Macrocycle Transport, Release, and Recapture Enabled by a Rotaxane Transporter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study represents a bistable rotaxane that enables the directional shuttling, release, and recapture of a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle upon addition of suitable chemical stimuli. This two&#8208;step molecular transport and release can be followed by NMR and distinct changes in the molecular fluorescence. Based on rational molecular design, the liberated macrocycle is recaptured on to the thread and the mechanical bond is regenerated which allows for directional macrocycle transport and release in an iterative manner.








Abstract
A transporter for a directional macrocycle transport, release, and recapture was constructed. This was achieved using a rotaxane featuring a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle, dibenzylammonium (DBA)/methyl triazolium (MTA) stations on the thread and anthracene/triisopropylsilyl&#8208;acetylene stoppers, respectively. In the protonated rotaxane, the macrocycle primarily resides on the DBA station, followed by directional shuttling to the MTA station upon treatment with base. Addition of fluoride as an additional chemical input cleaves the triisopropylsilyl stopper, leading to release of the macrocycle and the half&#8208;thread into solution. The released macrocycle can be recaptured by protonation, and the mechanical bond can be reestablished via CuAAC click reaction, enabled by the terminal acetylene unit on the half&#8208;thread. This generates an elongated second&#8208;generation rotaxane transporter, which was used for a second cycle of directional macrocycle transport and release, proving the possibility of an iterative operation of the rotaxane&#8208;transporter in this molecular design.

         <title>Tandem ADMET and CAMMP to Access Degradable Thermosets and Multiblock Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of degradable polymers and multiblock copolymeric (MBCPs) compatibilizers represents an appealing strategy to address ever&#8208;growing concerns for treating waste plastics of traditional chemical degradation or mechanical recycling. Although recent advancements in cyclic&#8208;acyclic monomers metathesis polymerization (CAMMP) and tandem olefin metathesis polymerization (TOMP) have recently been reported to produce degradable polymers and MBCPs via copolymerization of cyclic monomers with acyclic diene comonomers, there have been no reports of preparing high&#8208;performance thermosetting materials and multi&#8208;block copolymers within the same polymerization system solely through the selection of cycloolefin monomers. To achieve this objective, a tandem olefin metathesis polymerization system has been designed that combines acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of diene comonomers followed by CAMMP with cyclic olefin monomers (dicyclopentadiene DCPD or cyclooctene COE). The selection of different cyclic olefin monomers provided access to degradable cross&#8208;linked thermosets and multi&#8208;block copolymers. Notably, this one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step process is highly efficient and requires the addition of only one metathesis catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni(OH)x/Ni&#8208;Catalyzed In&#8208;Situ Hydrogenation and Ethanol Ethoxylation of 2&#8208;Methylfuran for Renewable Biofuel Co&#8208;Upgrading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioethanol and furanics are currently prevailing additives to fossil&#8208;based transportation fuels. With the objective to lift the longstanding limitations of these biofuel additives, this work reports for the first time the synthesis of 2&#8208;Ethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF) as a co&#8208;upgraded fuel by reacting ethanol with 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF). The formation of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF is achieved through ethanol ethoxylation of 2&#8208;MF, enabled by a reverse Ni(OH)x/Ni catalyst under hydrogen pressure. Nickel hydroxide species over the Ni nanoparticles play a crucial role in activating ethanol and polarizing the partially hydrogenated dihydrofuran intermediates, favorably steering the reaction selectively toward the ethoxylation product. The reaction conditions, including pressure and temperature, are systematically optimized to enhance the yield of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF, and provide a mean to beneficially tune the fuel compositions consisting mainly of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF and 2&#8208;MTHF, both are high energy density molecules. Importantly, the reverse Ni(OH)x&#8208;Ni catalyst allows a one&#8208;pot process to accomplish consecutive partial hydrogenation of 2&#8208;MF and ethanol ethoxylation. This work provides a practical strategy for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived polar primary fuel molecules into more versatile fuels and chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Prediction of Reactivity and Additive Selection for C(sp2)&#8211;(Hetero)atom Bond Couplings in an Adaptive Dynamic Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under visible light&#8208;driven redox conditions, employing transition&#8208;metal catalysis provides a powerful platform for constructing C(sp&#178;)&#8211;(hetero)atom bonds. Although these reactions are highly significant, they require precise optimization of reaction parameters. K&#246;nig, Ghosh and colleagues introduced an adaptive dynamic homogeneous catalysis (AD&#8208;HoC) platform that furnishes robust, high&#8208;yield conditions for photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The AD&#8208;HoC system eliminates the need to optimize catalysts, ligands, and bases; instead, it achieves C(sp&#178;)&#8211;(hetero)atom bond coupling by merely altering additives and substrate molecules. Leveraging the predictability of reaction conditions within the AD&#8208;HoC system, machine learning offers a method to evaluate the reactivity of substrate combinations and the categories of additives. Our research integrates high&#8208;throughput quantum mechanical calculations with cheminformatics approaches to explore the reactivity of substrate combinations and the selection of additives within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Further data&#8208;driven analysis reveals that the electronic characteristics of electrophiles and the geometric characteristics of nucleophiles are key factors regulating reactivity within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Herein, we present an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool for prediction starting from the SMILES representation. This work demonstrates the collaborative use of computational statistics and machine learning to predict the reactivity and reaction conditions of substrate combinations, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of synthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Generation of HF from KF and Formation of Amine&#8208;3HF Complexes by Using Cation Exchange Reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from potassium fluoride (KF) at room temperature was successfully demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY in acetonitrile (MeCN). After one of the cation exchange reactions, HF was generated from KF in 69% yield. On the other hand, HF was generated quantitatively by removing the generated HF and repeating the cation exchange reaction 7 times. During and after the cation exchange reaction, the generated HF was separated from the Amberlyst 15DRY by decantation and filtration without any loss of HF. When the Amberlyst 15DRY was regenerated and then reused in the cation exchange reaction 10 times, HF was generated almost quantitatively each time and the yield of HF did not decrease at all. In addition, when 1/3 equivalent of amines was added to the resulting HF&#8208;containing solution, a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes with controlled stoichiometric ratios were formed in quantitative yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bionanocomposite of Dual Antioxidant and Protease Function by Co&#8208;immobilization of Tannic Acid and Papain on Anionic Clays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synchronized operation of antioxidants and enzymes is necessary for the proper functioning of living organisms and various industrial processes. The drawback that these biomolecules are susceptible to several environmental factors can be overcome by their immobilization on appropriate host materials. Here, molecular antioxidant tannic acid (TA) and papain enzyme (PPN) were co&#8208;immobilized on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles to enhance their stability and facilitate their combined function. In the sequential adsorption method governed by electrostatic interactions, TA was first adsorbed on oppositely charged LDH (LDH/TA) and then, PPN was immobilized on the surface of the nanoparticles (LDH/TA/PPN). The optimal TA and PPN doses were determined by systematic size and charge measurements of the particles in dispersions to obtain stable colloids in each preparation step. The co&#8208;immobilization of the biomolecules was confirmed by spectroscopy methods. The resulting LDH/TA/PPN nanocomposite exhibited remarkable antioxidant and protease activities. The dual biological function together with the considerable colloidal stability make the LDH/TA/PPN material a promising candidate in various processes in academia and more applied disciplines, where simultaneous antioxidant and proteolytic functions are desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polyoxometalate&#8211;Metal Nanocluster Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Polyoxometalates (POMs) are structurally well&#8208;defined anionic metal&#8211;oxo clusters with diverse structural forms and distinctive physicochemical properties, including acidity/basicity, redox activity, and optical behavior. Over the past two decades, POMs have garnered increasing attention in metal nanocluster synthesis owing to their ability to impart unique structural and functional characteristics to these compounds. Initially, research in this field primarily focused on hybrid materials composed of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands. However, more recently, studies have demonstrated that POMs can themselves act as effective stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. These POM&#8208;stabilized metal nanoclusters exhibit synergistic and cooperative properties of metal nanocluster and POM components, enabling novel applications in fields such as catalysis, photochemistry, sensing, and electrochemistry. Notably, recent investigations into POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids have demonstrated their potential as atomically precise counterparts to metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on bulk metal oxides, exhibiting the unique cooperative catalysis. This review provides a concise overview of POM&#8210;metal nanocluster hybrids, with an emphasis on recent advancements in synthetic methodologies, properties, and applications. Additionally, solid&#8208;state synthetic strategies leveraging the rigid structures and redox properties of POMs for the controlled formation of metal nanoclusters are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitro&#8208;group &#960; system drives the interaction of RRx&#8208;001 with solvated electrons in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactivity towards low&#8208;energy electrons (LEE) has been hypothesized as a cause of radio&#8208;modifying properties for various molecules. LEE's transient nature, however, prevents the establishment of clear links between initial processes at the sub&#8208;ps time scale and the final products of radiolysis. Here, such links are explored for radio&#8208;modifying compound RRx&#8208;001 (1&#8208;bromoacetyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidine). &#160;Picosecond pulse radiolysis demonstrates the high scavenging capacity of the molecule for secondary quasi&#8208;free and solvated electrons forming stable parent anions confirmed by studies of microsolvated RRx&#8208;001 in clusters. The anions decay either via auto&#8208;detachment of an electron or dissociate involving hydrogen transfer from solvent resulting in NO2 and 1&#8208;(bromoacetyl)&#8208;3&#8208;nitroazetidine. Surprisingly, no Br dissociation is observed despite its high electron affinity. We assign this behavior to the "inaccessibility" of sigma virtual states for electrons in the solvent, which can be of a general nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited State Branching Processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited states properties such as excitation energy, accessibility of the respective excited state either by direct or indirect population transfer, and its lifetime govern the application of these excited states in light&#8208;driven reactions, e.g. photocatalysis using transition metal complexes. Compared with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) states, charge&#8208;separated (3CS) excited states involving organic moieties, such as triplet intra&#8208;ligand or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3ILCT and 3LLCT) states, tend to possess longer&#8208;lived excited states due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling with the closed&#8208;shell ground state. Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic chromophores enables isolating the triplet states onto the organic chromophore. Herein, we aim to elucidate the excited&#8208;state relaxation processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;terpyridyl donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor system (RuCl) in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical simulations and dissipative quantum dynamics. The electron transfer (ET) processes involving the low&#8208;lying 3MLCT, 3ILCT and 3LLCT excited states were investigated experimentally and computationally within a semi&#8208;classical Marcus picture. Finally, dissipative quantum dynamical simulations&#8211;capable of describing incomplete ET processes involving all three states&#8211;enabled us to unravel the competitive relaxation channels at short and long timescales among the strongly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3ILCT states and weakly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3LLCT and 3ILCT&#8208;3LLCT states.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Activated Alkyne Chemistry for the Synthesis of Tailored Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Assemblies for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) are a promising class of macromolecules capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this study, AJDs were synthesized employing, for the first time, the activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl "click" chemistry approach, enabling the construction of dendritic architectures under mild conditions. The AJDs were functionalized with a &#960;&#8208;extended tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative, imparting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. These AJDs self&#8208;assembled into fluorescent nanostructures, including micelles and dendrimersomes, with tunable dimensions. The AIE&#8208;active assemblies demonstrated strong photoluminescence upon aggregation and were characterized by narrow size distributions. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies using Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO&#8208;K1) cells revealed excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, confirming their potential for live&#8208;cell imaging. Importantly, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the TPE derivative facilitated excitation at longer wavelengths, compatible with conventional confocal microscopy. This work showcases the versatility of activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl "click" chemistry in dendrimer synthesis and highlights the potential of these AJD&#8208;based nanostructures in nanomedicine, particularly for imaging and diagnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;photon excitation of bright diaza[4]helicenes for isotropic and circularly polarized emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes are chiral organic dyes that are attracting growing attention due to the high tunability of their (chir)optical and electronic properties. In this work, a series of functionalized cationic diaza[4]helicenes based on dimethoxyquinacridinium (DMQA) scaffolds are presented. By merging branched N&#8208;alkyl side chains and triple para&#8208;functionalization with OMe groups, structures combine improved chiroptical responses (5x increase) and strong fluorescence quantum yields (&#966;f &#8776; 70% in acetonitrile). An overall improved efficiency of the emission of circularly polarized light with BCPL values reaching 3.4 M&#8211;1 cm&#8211;1 is obtained. Additionally, two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) studies were performed, showing good values of cross section at 810 nm. Interestingly, 2PE CPL spectra were acquired for the most performant derivatives (Nisopropyl and N&#8208;cyclohexyl); this type of measurement being usually challenging for organic molecular species. Finally, the viability of these compounds in single and two&#8208;photon excitation microscopy is also shown.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the modulation of the complex folding landscape of Human Telomeric DNA by low molecular weight ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Telomeric DNA forms G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. These G4s structures are crucial for genomic stability and therapeutic targeting. Using time&#8208;resolved NMR and CD spectroscopies, we investigated how the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 modulates the folding of the human telomeric repeat 23TAG DNA. The kinetics are modulated by the ligand and by the presence of potassium cations (K+). Ligand binding to G4 occurs via a triphasic process with fast and slow phases. Notably, for the G4 structure in the presence of K+, the slow rate is ten times slower than without K+. These findings offer key insights into the modulation of the complex folding landscape of G4s by ligands, advancing our understanding of G4&#8208;ligand interactions for potential therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids, as essential&#160;biomacromolecules, have&#160;garnered considerable scientific interest&#160;in diagnosis and therapy&#160;owing&#160;to their unique&#160;molecular characteristics, including&#160;sequence&#8208;specific&#160;programmability, precise molecular recognition capabilities, and diverse biological functionalities. In recent years, with the deepening in the understanding of the physicochemical properties of nucleic acids and development of nanotechnology, nucleic acid&#8208;based nanoprobes with sophisticated structures and functions have been gradually developed, opening up a new direction for efficient diagnosis followed by customized therapy for diseases. Despite the progress, the affinity and stability of nucleic acids to target sites&#160;still suffered from severs challenges, especially in complex physiological environments. Polyvalent&#160;nucleic acids, integrated with different functional elements, have demonstrated enormous advantages in effectively solving&#160;above limitations&#160;by elaborate design and construction of multifunctional&#160;DNA nanostructures, making them promising candidates for smart&#8208;responsive nanoprobes.&#160;In this review, we commence with an exploration of nucleic acids,&#160;subsequently delineating&#160;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for the fabrication of polyvalent&#160;nucleic acids&#160;nanostructures. We then predominantly underscore the latest advancements in these nanostructures as innovative platforms&#160;for cancer theranostics. Further, we critically examine the biomedical applications of polyvalent nucleic acids, alongside addressing the prevailing challenges and future prospects in the realm of nucleic acids&#8208;facilitated diagnostics and therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of a Homochiral Porous Organic Cage RCC2&#8208;S&#8208;Bonded Silica as a Stationary Phase for High&#8208;Performance Liquid Chromatography Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a reduced homochiral  porous organic cage (RCC2&#8208;S) based chiral stationary phase (CSP), RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH, was prepared by bonding RCC2&#8208;S on thiolated silica (SiO2&#8208;SH) viaa thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The CSP (RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH) showed excellent enantioseparation in both normal&#8208;phase HPLC (NP&#8208;HPLC) and reversed&#8208;phase HPLC (RP&#8208;HPLC) modes, effectively separating various chiral compounds, including alcohols, esters, ketones, amines, imidazoles, epoxides, and organic acids. As a result, 12 racemates were enantioseparated under NP&#8208;HPLC, and 17 racemates were enantioseparated under RP&#8208;HPLC. The CSP also exhibited good complementarity in chiral separation with commercial Chiralpak AD&#8208;H, Chiralcel OD&#8208;H, and the previously reported chiral POC CC19&#8208;R columns, successfully separating some racemates that remained unresolved or poorly resolved on these three columns. Additionally, the fabricated RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH packed column demonstrated good reproducibility and stability. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of retention time and resolution value were less than 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, after the column had been subjected to hundreds of injections. This work indicates that chiral porous organic cages have great potential for the separation of enantiomers in HPLC.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Symmetric Organic Aqueous Flow Batteries: Triarylamine&#8208;Based Bipolar Molecules and their Characterization via an Extended Kouteck&#253;&#8208;Levich Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Symmetric organic flow batteries (SOFBs) can potentially address membrane crossover problems by employing bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules (BROMs). Herein, a triarylamine (TAA) skeleton was chosen as a posolyte moiety for a new class of bipolar molecules for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous FBs. Pyridinium and viologen derivatives were tethered to the posolyte moiety, and the new compounds were characterized. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety via a Zincke reaction, could be reversibly reduced. Varying the supporting electrolyte concentration on the selected derivative revealed water solubility as a challenge for further development. The selected derivative, MeO&#8208;TPA&#8208;Vi&#8208;DMAE, was subjected to hydrodynamic voltammetry, and a modified Kouteck&#253;&#8208;Levich analysis was developed to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region, which are often seen with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. This model discarded a purely Ohmic effect, showing a useful Levich slope at a certain overpotential before the onset of a secondary reaction. TAA&#8208;based BROMs hold promise for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous SOFBs, and the results will guide the design of new derivatives. The three&#8208;term Kouteck&#253;&#8208;Levich relation here introduced will be useful not only to develop BROM&#8208;based flow batteries but will most likely appeal to a much broader audience.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Aggregation of Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the straightforward synthesis of a family of amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide dyads containing sterically demanding substituents at the porphyrin meso&#8208;position, as well as at the PBI bay position. The hydrophilic head group consists of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid G2&#8208;Newkome dendrons attached to the porphyrin, whereas lipophilic pentyl&#8208;hexyl&#8208;swallowtails are connected to the PBI imide position. Using UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, their THF initiated disaggregation was studied in aqueous media. Without meso&#8208;substituents, a stronger interaction between the porphyrins was observed in the aggregated state. Insights into the size and morphology of the aggregates were obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these revealed micelles and liposomes as plausible architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reprocessable Dynamic Disulfide Hydrogel for Capacitive Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapidly growing demand for wearable sensor devices across a range of applications, sensing technology has been rapidly advancing. However, challenges such as limited sensitivity, device instability, and trade&#8208;offs between performance and recyclability remain unaddressed. We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel from an amphiphilic polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative with hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics. The hydrogel demonstrates decent thermal stability and adequate mechanical properties, including elasticity, compressibility, and reprocessing capability. It is also integrated into a microstructured capacitive sensor, demonstrating a sensitivity of up to 1.14 kPa&#8208;1, rapid response times within 20 ms, and robust functioning stability up to 400 consecutive cycles. These properties make it particularly intriguing for the sustainable development of high&#8208;performance wearable sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Catalytic Olefin Polymerization with Nickel and Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefins are extensively used in modern society, with hydrocarbon organic compounds traditionally serving as solvents for their preparation. Water, as a reaction medium, offers significant advantages, including non&#8208;flammability, non&#8208;toxicity, high specific heat capacity, and strong polarity. A promising avenue of research involves replacing organic media with water in polymerization reactions, which could yield considerable economic benefits. Among the various transition metal catalysts used to synthesize polyolefins, late&#8208;transition metal catalysts, such as Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts, demonstrate enhanced tolerance to polar groups, making them particularly suitable for aqueous polymerization of olefins. This review focuses on the Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalysts utilized for the aqueous catalytic polymerization of olefins, as well as various types of polyolefins fabricated. Key aspects encompass designs of catalysts, polymerization systems, monomers, and material microstructures. The preparation of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocrystals and the modulation of polymer morphology are highlighted. The possible development trend of aqueous catalytic polymerization is envisioned to achieve the development concept of environmental protection and the needs of industrial production.</dc:description>

         <title>DOS&#8208;like strategy for the spirocyclic MedChem relevant building blocks via Petasis / Grubbs reactions sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through this model study, we showed broad perspectives on utilizing the DOS&#8208;like approach on the building block level in combination with well&#8208;developed methodologies for parallel synthesis for decoration and extension of ultra&#8208;large tangible chemical space to increase the speed and quality of drug discovery screening campaigns. This strategy led us to 16 novel Bemis&#8208;Murco scaffolds based on spirocyclic functionalized piperidines. The efficient, preparative, and scalable DOS&#8208;like approach to the above&#8208;mentioned motif was achieved by Petasis/Grubbs reactions sequence in a multigram scale. The chemoinformatically generated amide&#8208;based compound libraries demonstrated significant expansion of the chemical space of tangible compounds (on the example of Enamine&#8217;s REAL database).</dc:description>

         <title>CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx Composite Interfaces with Strong Lewis Acid Activity for Electrooxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of methane (CH4) to valuable oxygenates is an attractive approach to utilize abundant natural gas, however, the chemical inertness of CH4 and low solubility in electrolytes impede effective electrooxidation. Enhancing the adsorption and activation of CH4 on catalysts is crucial for electrocatalytic methane oxidation reaction (eMOR). In this study, we develop the CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx composite catalyst for the selective electrooxidation of CH4 to CH3COOH. The ZrO2&#8208;TiOx was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanowires with H2C2O4 and Zr(NO3)4. Subsequently, CuOx was uniformly disposed on ZrO2&#8208;TiOx with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone and citric acid. The prepared electrode achieves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.1% for CH3COOH at the current density of 10.8 mA cm&#8208;2, corresponding to the generation rate of 3312.5 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Mechanism studies confirm that the synergistic effect of CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces enhances the efficiency of eMOR. CuOx oxidizes H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces with strong Lewis acid activity adsorb and activate CH4. The CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces synergistically oxidize CH4 to generate a series of intermediates (*CH3, *CH3O, *CH2O, *COOH), promoting C&#8208;C coupling to produce CH3COOH.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;harvesting&#160; Pt(II) Amine Cage and Its Application as Security Ink</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new Platinum (II)&#8208;Triphenylamine tetra aldehyde&#8208;based barrel&#8208;shaped rectangular covalent cage was prepared using dynamic imine condensation and subsequent reduction.

         <title>Kinetically arrested SERS&#8208;Active aggregates for biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. Biofluids present challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tuneable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Controlled aggregation of AuNPs has been achieved by incorporating a &#8216;molecular&#8208;glue&#8217;, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), to produce AuNP:CB[7] aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1 nm) and displaying strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations, but eventually leads to irreversible precipitation. Here we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates. The aggregates maintain SERS&#8208;activity, are highly tuneable through facile modification of the PEG chain length and grafting density, and possess improved stability. Moreover, the AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates demonstrate low concentration detection of a common Raman reporter alongside a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Oxidation of Alkanes and Post&#8208;Functionalization of Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on the post&#8208;functionalization of polyolefin elastomers (POE) through direct C&#8208;H activation using a novel cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The investigation, initiated with the oxidation of cyclohexane, identified the cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO) as the optimal oxidant and ligands L3, L4, and L7 as effective in chlorinated benzene solvents. Cobalt catalyst (Cat. 1) demonstrated superior activity in the oxidation of octadecane, achieving a 42% yield with a minimal catalyst amounts. The catalytic system was successfully extended to the C&#8208;H oxidation of POE, introducing functional groups in solvents like 1,2&#8208;Cl2C6H4 and 1,2,4&#8208;Cl3C6H3. Our findings propose a simple and green approach for the post&#8208;functionalization of POE, offering versatility and potential for broader applications in the field of polymeric compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Higher BODIPY Homologues &#8211; Synthesis, Reactivity and Photoluminescence Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of MesDPM group 13 (B&#8211;In, MesDPM = 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene) compounds with halide substituents (Cl&#8211;I) is described. All compounds were fully characterized including NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. In addition, the solid state molecular structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As higher representatives of BODIPY (= boron difluoride dipyrromethene) dyes, some of these MesDPM triel dihalides also exhibit an intense green fluorescence when exposed to sunlight. In this regard, the optical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy giving absorption maxima around 520 nm and fluorescence emission in the range between and 550 and 660 nm. Fluorescence quantum efficiencies up to 42% could be obtained from measurements in toluene solution. Further, reactivity studies were carried out which opened&#8208;up access to mixed substituted MesDPM triels with one alkyl and one halide substituent.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine&#8208;tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;chalcogen I&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in FTIR, NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with EXAFS and XANES synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Aldehyde and Carboxylic Acid Substitution on the Isomerization of Hemithioindigo Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemithioindigo (HTI) photoswitches exhibit robust photoisomerization under visible light and relatively high thermal bistability. In this work, we report various modifications of the HTI core, namely the introduction of aldehydes and carboxylic acids at the para position of the stilbene fragment with different oxidation states of the sulfur center, and the incorporation of a Schiff base moiety. These modifications allowed tuning of the absorption properties, quantum yields of isomerization, and thermal stability of the metastable E&#8208;isomers. Notably, the formyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;substituted HTI switches achieved high yields of isomerization under visible light in various solvents, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduced photochromism. Schiff base formation led to red&#8208;shifted absorption and increased thermal stability. Finally, by leveraging the carboxyl substituents, we incorporated an HTI chromophore into the NU&#8208;1000 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and demonstrated solid&#8208;state photoisomerization. These findings highlight key structural modifications that expand the applicability of HTI photoswitches for molecular switching in solution and solid&#8208;state environments.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct &#945;&#8208;arylation of a protected 4&#8208;hydroxy piperidine via a one&#8208;pot Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction is described. The methodology uses a single solvent, toluene, for the lithiation / transmetallation / Negishi sequence and 20 examples are presented. Of note, the high yielding cross&#8208;coupling of a range of pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant heteroaryl bromides is reported. The reactions show high levels of 2,4&#8208;cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and further functionalisations are also described. Piperidine is the most common nitrogen heterocycle in approved drugs and our approach delivers such heterocycles via a direct diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalisation of 4&#8208;substituted N&#8208;Boc piperidines; as such, the approach is ready to be utilised in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyimides with Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Properties by End&#8208;capping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic polymers possessing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) significantly impact their electronic and optical properties through stimulus response, leading to unique photoluminescence behaviors such as large Stokes shifts, dual emission, and environmental sensitivity. In this work, polyimides (PIs) exhibiting both ESIPT and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties were designed and synthesized by end&#8208;capping with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBTA) and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzimidazole (HBIA), respectively. HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI exhibit bright yellow&#8208;green and sky&#8208;blue fluorescence at 510&#160;and 470 nm, with a relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields of about 27.2% and 25.1%, respectively. Importantly, HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI show excellent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emissions at 520&#160;and 485 nm, with decay lifetimes of 76.5 ms and 53.2 ms. The theoretical results indicate that the effective and large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) constants from their keto forms in the excited state can enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) process to produce triplet excitons. The rigid polyimide networks further inhibit the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons and enhance phosphorescence emission. Additionally, the excellent ESIPT properties of HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI enable the detection of HCl vapor, which induces multiple fluorescent and phosphorescent color changes. This work provides good examples of polyimides for organic polymers with ESIPT properties and multi&#8208;stimulus response emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrophosphination Using Calcium Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophosphination using calcium compounds as catalysts under irradiation is described as a foray into s&#8208;block photocatalysis. Transition&#8208;metal compounds have been highly successful hydrophosphination catalysts under photochemical conditions, utilizing substrates previously considered inaccessible. A calcium hydrophosphination precatalyst, Ca(nacnac)(THF)(N(SiMe3)2) (1, nacnac = HC[(C(Me)N&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)]2), reported by Barrett and Hill, as well as the presumed intermediate, Ca(nacnac)(THF)(PPh2) (2), and the Schlenk equilibrium product, Ca[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 (3) were screened under photochemical conditions with a range of unsaturated substrates including styrenic alkenes, Michael acceptors, and dienes with modest to excellent conversions, though unactivated alkenes were inaccessible. All compounds exhibit enhanced catalysis under irradiation by LED&#8208;generated blue light. Nacnac&#8208;supported compounds generate radicals as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and radical trapping reactions, whereas unsupported calcium compounds are EPR silent and appear to undergo hydrophosphination akin to thermal reactions with these compounds. These results buttress the notion that photoactivation of &#960;&#8208;basic ligands is a broad phenomenon, extending beyond the d&#8208;block, but like d&#8208;block metals, consideration of ancillary ligands is essential to avoid radical reactivity.</dc:description>
