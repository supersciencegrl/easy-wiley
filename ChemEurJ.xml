         <title>Advances in Selectively Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Alkynes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective electrochemical hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive and high&#8208;cost thermocatalytic hydrogenation. However, the systematic summary on the electrocatalysts and electrolyzers remains lacked. Herein, we demonstrate a comprehensive review about recent achievements in the electrocatalysts including noble metal and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal materials. Several effective strategies of catalyst design were developed to improve alkyne conversion, and alkene selectivity e.g., accelerating the formation of active hydrogen species, enhancing alkyne adsorption and suppressing the side reactions. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of various electrolyzers are systematically discussed. Accordingly, major challenges and future trends in this field are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chelate Effect Rationalizes Observed Rate Acceleration and Enantioselectivity in BINOL&#8208;Catalyzed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Density Functional Theory calculations afforded insight into the origin of the reaction rate acceleration (&#8805;500 fold) and enantioselectivity (&#8805;99% ee) of BINOL&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component Petasis reactions observed experimentally. BINOL accelerates the rate determining step by forming a B(IV) chelate, which involves the loss of water from the hemiaminal moiety to generate an iminium cation. Subsequent vinyl group transfer from B(IV) to the iminium carbon affords the enantiomerically enriched product and a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL complex, which rapidly releases the BINOL allowing it to re&#8208;enter the catalytic cycle. In the transition state of the vinyl transfer step, C&#8722;H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O hydrogen bonding between the iminium C&#8722;H and O of (R)&#8208;BINOL directs the vinyl group addition to the Re&#8208;face of the iminium carbon. This mechanism explains both the rate acceleration and high enantioselectivity of the stereo determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbotrifluoromethylations of C&#8211;C Multiple Bonds (Excluding Aryl&#8208; and Alkynyltrifluoromethylations)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organofluorine chemistry has become an expanding area of research in organic chemistry and drug design. The synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules has received high significance in synthetic chemistry. Trifluoromethylative difunctionalizations of carbon&#8211;carbon multiple bonds with the simultaneous introduction of a CF3 group and another function have considerable relevance. Because of the high importance of carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions in organic synthesis, carbotrifluoromethylations are considered to be a field of synthetic chemistry of increasing importance. Our current goal in this review is to summarize recent developments of various trifluoromethylation reactions (excluding aryl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;trifluoromethylations) taking into consideration several main approaches, such as alkenyltrifluoromethylation, alkyltrifluoromethylation, carbonyltrifluoromethylation, and cyanotrifluoromethylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Coupling of &#960;&#8208;Systems to Access Metallated 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;Skipped Dienes in Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembling metallated skipped dienes employing C&#8722;C &#960; systems in intermolecular fashion requires the chemoselective activation of either of the components by transition metals. In this Concept article, a clear picture of advancements in the synthesis of skipped dienes decorated with metallic groups (boron and silicon) is described. In addition, recent discoveries are highlighted in depth, emphasizing mechanistic studies, where paradigm shifts resulting from the substrate&#8208;chelation can be anticipated.







Abstract
Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8722;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8722;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.&#8201;g., [Si]&#8722;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, this article attempts to include all precedents, including recent studies by the authors. The present Concept article may be helpful for researchers working in this area as it provides a basic conceptual framework.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering of ZnO/CdS Heterostructures through ZnS Layers for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caught in the middle: By introducing a heterointerface layer of ZnS between ZnO and CdS, a Z&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer channel is promoted and the as&#8208;prepared heterostructures display superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting to produce clean and renewable hydrogen offers a green strategy to address the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Heterostructure catalysts are receiving increasing attention for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. ZnO/ZnS/CdS and ZnO/CdS heterostructures have been successfully designed and prepared according to two different strategies. By introducing a heterointerface layer of ZnS between ZnO and CdS, a Z scheme charge&#8208;transfer channel was promoted and achieved superior photocatalytic performance. A highest hydrogen generation rate of 156.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved by precise control of the thickness of the heterointerface layer and of the CdS shell. These findings demonstrated that heterostructures are promising catalysts for solar&#8208;driven water splitting, and that heterointerface engineering is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic properties of heterostructures.

         <title>One&#8208;step Oxidative Monofluorination of Electron&#8208;Deficient Sulfoxides to Access Highly Lewis Acidic Sulfur(VI) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations can be prepared in a one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free fashion from electron&#8208;deficient sulfoxides using [FXe][OTf]. The latter is prepared by reaction of XeF2 with TMS&#8208;OTf, thus representing an inversion of the previously described Umpolung strategy, which failed to convert the same sulfoxides efficiently. The Lewis acidities of the obtained cations have been probed experimentally and computationally.







Abstract
The strongly oxidizing, powerful electrophilic fluorination reagent [FXe][OTf] is shown to effect direct oxidative monofluorination of sulfoxides. This one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free methodology provides access to so far inaccessible, yet highly desirable strongly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations from electron&#8208;deficient and/or sterically demanding sulfoxides that are shown to be practically unreactive towards the previously reported XeF2/NEt4Cl system. Experimental and density functional theory studies have been conducted to assess the Lewis acidities of the prepared sulfur(VI) cations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highly Lewis acidic&lt;/b&gt; fluorosulfoxonium cations can be prepared in a one-step, chloride promoter-free fashion from electron-deficient sulfoxides using [FXe][OTf]. The latter is prepared by reaction of XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with TMS-OTf, thus representing an inversion of the previously described Umpolung strategy, which failed to convert the same sulfoxides efficiently. The Lewis acidities of the obtained cations have been probed experimentally and computationally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongly oxidizing, powerful electrophilic fluorination reagent [FXe][OTf] is shown to effect direct oxidative monofluorination of sulfoxides. This one-step, chloride promoter-free methodology provides access to so far inaccessible, yet highly desirable strongly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations from electron-deficient and/or sterically demanding sulfoxides that are shown to be practically unreactive towards the previously reported XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NEt&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl system. Experimental and density functional theory studies have been conducted to assess the Lewis acidities of the prepared sulfur(VI) cations. Preliminary results obtained with chiral sulfoxides provide early insights into the mechanism of these fluorination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Enabling semiconducting properties in N&#8208;acenoacenes. Reducing the steric demand of N&#8208;acenoacenes tunes the solid&#8208;state packings of N&#8208;acenoacenes in favor of &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking, allowing charge transfer through the crystal lattice. The first utilization of N&#8208;acenoacenes in p&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors is reported.







Abstract
Four N&#8208;acenoacenes were synthesized and analyzed for their optoelectronic properties and solid&#8208;state packings. Two of the regioisomeric acridinoacridines are TIPS&#8208;ethynylated, whereas the other pair are Boc&#8208; and triflate substituted derivatives. The two TIPS&#8208;ethynyldiazaacenoacenes were processed into organic thin&#8208;film transistors with saturation hole mobilities reaching 2.9&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2(Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two do the job: Diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to a PNNP expanded pincer ligand are described. Deprotonation of the methylene linkers enables cooperative activation of H2 allowing for the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes under mild conditions. Initial insights into the mechanism and the isolation of a deactivated species with an unusual structure are provided.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of a new class of diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to the tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand is described. Reacting tBuPNNP with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh3)3(CO) at 140&#8201;&#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru2(tBuPNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO)2] (1) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KOtBu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru2(tBuPNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;OtBu)(CO)2] (3) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core. This enables metal&#8208;ligand cooperative activation of H2 analogous to the mononuclear analogue, [Ru(tBuPNP*)H(CO)]. In contrast to the mononuclear system, the bimetallic analogue 3 catalyzes the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes at ambient temperature and atmospheric H2 pressure with good functional group tolerance. Monitoring the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows the intermediacy of Z&#8208;stilbene, which is subsequently isomerized to the E&#8208;isomer. Initial findings into the mode of action of this system are provided, including the spectroscopic characterization of a polyhydride intermediate and the isolation of a deactivated species with a partially hydrogenated naphthyridine backbone.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>

T&#8208;DDMs for membrane proteins: A series of &#8220;hydrophobicity&#8208;neutral&#8221; linkers were incorporated between the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic maltose of the traditional detergent DDM. This remodeling strategy yielded T&#8208;DDMs, among which superior detergents with excellent physical properties and stabilization capability were identified, as illustrated in the NMR study of A2AAR.







Abstract
It is a pressing need, but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles is the limited availability of matched detergents for the handling of specific MPs. We describe herein the design of new detergents by incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between the outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in while retaining low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these that results will encourage future detergent expansion through new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8211;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of a new THF&#8208;solvated, ferrocene&#8208;based Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base with all four components lithium, potassium, carbanion, and alkoxide led to the observation of new structural motifs with respect to these superbasic reagents. The &#8220;kick out&#8221; of a THF leads to the detachment, providing the typical Li/K reaction site, whereas the &#8220;smart pass&#8221; leads to the favorable THF&#8208;displacement and the K/K reaction site provided for substrates.







Abstract
The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert&#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho&#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene, an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8211;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base that is reported herein.

Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8211;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base that is reported herein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] was successfully synthesized from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8201;&#8242;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) by conventional solvothermal method.

Abstract
In this study, a novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] (referred to as SLX&#8208;2), from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized by using X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2D SLX&#8208;2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX&#8208;2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Integration of a [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimic to Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic integrating two pyrene anchors was successfully synthesized and grafted at the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotube based electrodes. The hybrid molecular cathode could reach high turnover numbers for H2 production in fully aqueous media and sustain activity for 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Surface integration of molecular catalysts inspired from the active sites of hydrogenase enzymes represents a promising route towards developing noble metal&#8208;free and sustainable technologies for H2 production. Efficient and stable catalyst anchoring is a key aspect to enable this approach. Herein, we report the preparation and electrochemical characterization of an original diironhexacarbonyl complex including two pyrene groups per catalytic unit in order to allow for its smooth integration, through &#960;&#8208;interactions, onto multiwalled carbon nanotube&#8208;based electrodes. In this configuration, the grafted catalyst could reach turnover numbers for H2 production (TONH2) of up to 4&#177;2&#215;103 within 20&#8197;h of bulk electrolysis, operating at neutral pH. Post operando analysis of catalyst functionalized electrodes revealed the degradation of the catalytic unit occurred via loss of the iron carbonyl units, while the anchoring groups and most part of the ligand remained attached onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes.

         <title>Modulation of Metal Carbonyl Stretching Frequencies in the Second Coordination Sphere through the Internal Stark Effect</title>

Carbonyl stretching frequencies of late transition metal pybox complexes demonstrate the intrinsic role of internal electric fields in metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding.







Abstract
Spectroscopic and computational examination of a homologous series of rhodium(I) pybox carbonyl complexes has revealed a correlation between the conformation of the flanking aryl&#8208;substituted oxazoline donors and the carbonyl stretching frequency. This relationship is also observed experimentally for octahedral rhodium(III) and ruthenium(II) variants and cannot be explained through the classical, Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson, interpretation of metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding. Instead, these findings are reconciled by local changes in the magnitude of the electric field that is projected along the metal&#8208;carbonyl vector: the internal Stark effect.

         <title>Heavy Chains: Synthesis, Reactivity and Decomposition of Interpnictogen Chains with Terminal Diaryl Bismuth Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>

Making and breaking chains. Interpnictogen chains have been synthesized, and their decomposition has been studied. It was shown that the compound Ph2BiP(tBu)BiPh2 reacts with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Me2IMe) as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221; to form Me2IMe=PtBu.







Abstract
In this work, we report the preparation of multiple interpnictogen chain compounds with three consecutive pnictogen atoms and terminal Ar2Bi fragments (Ar=Ph, Mes). Symmetrical compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E(tBu)&#8722;Bi2Ar (1: Ar=Ph, E=P; 2: Ar=Ph, Mes, E=As) as well as ternary interpnictogen compounds of the form Ar2Bi&#8722;E1(tBu)&#8722;E2tBu2 (Ar=Ph, Mes; 4: E1=P, E2=As; 5: E1=P, E2=Sb; 6: E1=As, E2=P) were prepared. The decomposition in solution at room temperature and under the influence of light was studied for compounds 1&#8211;6. The reactivity of 1Ph and 2Ph with the small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Me2IMe) was also studied. In the case of 1Ph, the formation and consecutive decomposition of Me2IMe=PtBu (8) was observed in solution. Hence, it was shown that 1Ph can react as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221;. In the case of 2Ph, no reaction with Me2IMe was observed. All isolated compounds were analysed by NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

The decomposition in solution at room temperature and under the influence of light was studied for compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;. The reactivity of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with the small N-heterocyclic carbene 1,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazol-2-ylidene (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IMe) was also studied. In the case of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, the formation and consecutive decomposition of Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IMe=P&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) was observed in solution. Hence, it was shown that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; can react as a &#8220;masked phosphinidene&#8221;. In the case of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;Ph&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, no reaction with Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IMe was observed. All isolated compounds were analysed by NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2] Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic route to strained cyclophanes is reported, which involves the unexpected photochemical fusion of a carboxylic ester and a non&#8208;activated methyl group. Functional experiments suggest that the previously overlooked C&#8722;C bond forming reaction involves an excited triplet state and intramolecular hydrogen abstraction. Using a flow reactor, a series of otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared







Abstract
The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes are an important target for synthesis since they are found in various chiral auxiliaries, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkably simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8722;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments, point to a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer. The new method proved to be robust and versatile enabling the synthesis of a range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers, and thus proved to be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox.

         <title>Integrated Reversible Thermochromism, High Tc, Dielectric Switch and Narrow Band Gap in One Multifunctional Ferroic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic shows a high phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. The coexistence of ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties makes it potentially promising for use in multifunctional smart devices such as nature&#8208;bionic, energy conversion, signal storage and encryption, and switching.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid (OIH) materials for multifunctional switchable applications have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and good structural tunability. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate one simple OIH compound with multi&#8208;functionals properties, such as dielectric switching, thermochromic properties, semiconductor characteristics and ferroelasticity. Under this context, we successfully synthesized [2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208; ammonium]2SnBr6 (compound 1), which has a higher phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. Additionally, it exhibits a semiconducting property with an indirect band gap of 2.36&#8197;eV. Combining ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties, compound 1 can be considered as a rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic material, which is expected to give inspiration for broadening the applications in the smart devices field.

Ortho&#8208;iodo diaryl ethers are selectively transformed into either oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclic diaryliodonium salts or ortho&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted acyclic diaryliodonium salts through regioselective and high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot routes.

Abstract
Two regioselective, high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot routes to oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclic diaryliodonium salts and ortho&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted acyclic diaryliodonium salts are presented. Starting from easily available ortho&#8208;iodo diaryl ethers, complete selectivity in formation of either the cyclic or acyclic product could be achieved by varying the reaction conditions. The complimentary reactivities of these novel ortho&#8208;oxygenated iodonium salts were demonstrated through a series of chemoselective arylations under metal&#8208;catalyzed and metal&#8208;free conditions, to deliver a range of novel, ortho&#8208;functionalized diaryl ether derivatives.

Getting back to (nucleo)base: Oligonucleotides incorporating a central 1&#8208; or 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole residue show great promise as high&#8208;affinity hybridization probes, discriminating between all canonical nucleobases as well as 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymines by melting temperature margins of at least 5&#8201;&#176;C. Duplexes facilitating HgII&#8722;S coordination were particularly stable, with melting temperatures nearly 30&#8201;&#176;C higher than those of respective unmodified duplexes.







Abstract
Short oligonucleotides incorporating either 1&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, or 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole C&#8208;nucleoside in the middle of the chain have been synthesized and studied for their potential as hybridization probes for sequences containing thiopyrimidine nucleobases. All of these oligonucleotides formed very stable duplexes with complementary sequences pairing the organometallic moiety with either 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;thiothymine. The isomeric monomercurated oligonucleotides were also able to discriminate between 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymine based on the different melting temperatures of the respective duplexes. DFT&#8208;optimized structures of the most stable mononuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs featured a coordinated covalent bond between HgII and either S2 or S4 and a hydrogen bond between the carbazole nitrogen and N3. The dinuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs, in turn, were geometrically very similar to the one previously reported to form between 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole and thymine and had one HgII ion coordinated to a thio and the other one to an oxo substituent.

         <title>Regiodivergent Asymmetric Pyridinium Additions: Mechanistic Insight and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent asymmetric dearomatization of readily accessible pyridines has enabled the redox&#8208;economic synthesis of both (+)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Paroxetine. A mechanistic rationale for the regiodivergent pyridinium additions and evaluation of their scope was also explored.







Abstract
A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)&#8208;N&#8208;methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;paroxetine.

         <title>The Radical Anion, Dianion and Electron Transport Properties of Tetraiodotetraazapentacene</title>

Filling the gap in the series of halogenated azaacenes. Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP is prepared and characterized. Its stable radical anion and high mobilities in organic field&#8208;effect transistors make I4TAP a formidable n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP, the last missing derivative in the series of halogenated silylated tetraazapentacenes, was synthesized via condensation chemistry from a TIPS&#8208;ethynylated diaminobenzothiadiazol in three steps. Single and double reduction furnished its air&#8208;stable monoanion and relatively air&#8208;stable dianion, both of which were characterized by crystallography. All three species are structurally and spectroscopically compared to non&#8208;halogenated TAP and Br4TAP. I4TAP is an n&#8208;channel material in thin&#8208;film transistors with average electron mobilities exceeding 1&#8197;cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Observable Interconversion Between Si(IV) and Si(II) via Reversible Intramolecular Insertion Into an Aromatic C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new silepin with a sterically encumbered silyl ligand was achieved, which shows a spectral observable equilibrium towards the isomeric acyclic silylene at room temperature. The equilibrium was analyzed by VT&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis measurements supported by DFT calculations. Furthermore, the reactivity of the silepin/silylen towards small molecules was investigated.







Abstract
An easily isolable silacycloheptatriene (silepin) 1&#8201;b was synthesized from the reaction of a N&#8208;heterocyclic imino (IPrN) substituted tribromosilane IPrNSiBr3 with the sterically congested bis(trimethylsilyl)triisopropylsilyl silanide KSi(TMS)2Si(iPr)3 (BTTPS). In solution, the Si(IV) silepin 1&#8201;b is in a thermodynamic equilibrium with the acyclic Si(II) silylene 1&#8201;a. The relative concentration of the Si(II) or Si(IV) isomers can be controlled by temperature variation and observed by variable temperature NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. DFT calculations show a small reaction barrier for the Si(II)&#8652;Si(IV) interconversion and a small energy gap between the Si(II) and Si(IV) species. The reactivity of 1&#8201;a/b is demonstrated on a variety of small molecules.

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960; Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaromatic capsule with a spheroidal cavity displays superior binding abilities toward planar compounds through multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32). In the cavity, one molecule of polyaromatic coronene is exclusively bound from mixtures and one molecule of Cu(II) complexes is bound quantitatively and isolated from bulk phases.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i)&#8197;selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii)&#8197;effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.&#8201;e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32&#8197;interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.&#8201;e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects on [3+2] Cycloaddition (32CA) Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 69, December 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanistic study of [3+2] cycloadditions between nitroolefins and azides is described. Combining DFT calculations, kinetic studies, and activation strain analysis, our studies shed new mechanistic insight on the factors controlling reactivity and regioselectivity in this transformation and highlight the role of non&#8208;statistical effects in organocatalyzed and metal&#8208;free dipolar cycloadditions.







Abstract
[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst&#8208;free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate&#8208;limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5&#8208;triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second&#8208;order rate law, and 13C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;&#8208;carbons of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less&#8208;distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5&#8208; over 1,4&#8208;cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous Ei&#8208;type HNO2 elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct&#8208;dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.

     alt="Mechanistic Aspects on [3+2] Cycloaddition (32CA) Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A detailed mechanistic study of [3+2] cycloadditions&lt;/b&gt; between nitroolefins and azides is described. Combining DFT calculations, kinetic studies, and activation strain analysis, our studies shed new mechanistic insight on the factors controlling reactivity and regioselectivity in this transformation and highlight the role of non-statistical effects in organocatalyzed and metal-free dipolar cycloadditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst-free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate-limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5-triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second-order rate law, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;-carbons of &#946;-nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction-activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less-distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5- over 1,4-cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous &lt;i&gt;Ei&lt;/i&gt;-type HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct-dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering is a powerful tool for manipulating cell surface and cell behavior. Herein, we demonstrate that DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as functional modules can be rationally integrated into cell surface to confer cells with new functions and control over cell behaviors. We believe that DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering will be capable of bringing more opportunities to cell surface engineering and cell&#8208;based biomedical applications. For more information, see the Review by Q. Liu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202070).

Chains made of bismuth and other group 15 elements were prepared and investigated with respect to their reactivity. Three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered chains of different compositions were obtained. It is shown that, for example, the Bi&#8722;P&#8722;Bi chain can be cleaved with a carbene. In this reaction, the middle chain link is transferred as a phosphinide to the carbene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Dunaj and C. von&#8197;H&#228;nisch (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202932).

Intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention as electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge, although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. The seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach is a promising tool for precise control over these parameters of IMNCs.







Abstract
In recent years, intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge to the traditional method of high&#8208;temperature annealing although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. Controllable synthesis of IMNCs by the wet chemistry method in the liquid phase shows great potential compared with the traditional high&#8208;temperature annealing method. In this Review, we attempt to summarize the preparation of IMNCs by the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis in the liquid phase, as well as their applications in electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Several representative examples are purposely selected for highlighting the huge potential of the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach in chemical synthesis. Specifically, we personally perceive the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach as a promising tool in the future for precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs.

         <title>Sequential C&#8722;H Methylation Catalyzed by the B12&#8208;Dependent SAM Enzyme TokK: Comprehensive Theoretical Study of Selectivities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme, TokK catalyzes consecutive methylation reactions on a pantetheinylated carbapenem substrate. A stepwise &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; radical transfer mechanism is proposed for each methylation: a 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate, then methylcobalamin donates a methyl group to the substrate. The calculations can uncover the origin of the observed chemoselectivity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity.







Abstract
TokK is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic asparenomycin&#8197;A. It can catalyze three methylations on different sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon positions to introduce an isopropyl side chain at the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of pantetheinylated carbapenem. Herein, we report a quantum chemical study of the reaction mechanism of TokK. A stepwise &#8216;&#8216;push&#8208;pull&#8217;&#8217; radical relay mechanism is proposed for each methylation: a 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate in the active site, then methylcobalamin directionally donates a methyl group to the substrate. More importantly, calculations were able to uncover the origin of observed chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity for the first methylation and regioselectivity for the following two methylations. Further detailed distortion/interaction analysis can help to unravel the main factors controlling the selectivities. Our findings of sequential methylations by TokK could have profound implications for studying other B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes.

         <title>PtSnBi Nanoplates Enable Photoacoustic Imaging Guided Highly Efficient Photothermal Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with robust photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for cancer photothermal therapy. Herein, a novel PTA was created using two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates (NPs), which demonstrated excellent photostability and biocompatibility with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of ~61% after PEGylation. More importantly, PtSnBi NPs could be employed as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents for tumor visualization due to their strong absorbance in the NIR range. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that PtSnBi NPs had a good photothermal efficacy under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, the remarkable therapeutic characteristics of PtSnBi NPs make them make them a most promising candidate for cancer theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Quinoid conjugated polymer nanoparticles with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak toward efficient photothermal therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of the second near&#8208;infrared bio&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) theranostic agents owing to the excellent tissue&#8208;penetration capability of NIR&#8208;II light. The exploration of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy materials, especially those with absorption peak over 1000 nm, is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, we have designed conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PIS NPs) with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak at 1026 nm through a combined strategy of introducing quinoid donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structures, constructing intramolecular &#8220;conformational locks&#8221; and extending the conjugation area to narrow the band gap. Irradiated at 1064 nm, PIS NPs showed remarkable photothermal conversion performance for efficient photothermal ablation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. This study provides useful insights into the rational design of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents based on multiple strategies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Cymene ruthenium(II) complexes are widely used as catalysts in C&#8722;H activation. However, enantioselective C&#8722;H activation promoted by arene ruthenium(II) complexes has not been realized until recently. The emerging strategies&#8208;the use of intramolecular nitrene C&#8722;H insertion, chiral transient directing groups, chiral carboxylic acid, relay catalysis and chiral arene ligands&#8208;are summarized and discussed in this minireview.

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Chloride Corrosion by Controlling the Morphologies of PtNi Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Corrosion control: A PtNi alloy with a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles is described. The unique morphology of the PtNi alloy facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances its resistance to chloride corrosion and performance in electrocatalytic hydrogen production in seawater.







Abstract
A solvothermal method to prepare PtNi alloys that have differing morphologies is described. By adjusting the feed ratio of Pt and Ni precursors in this process, PtNi alloys with different compositions (Pt&#8201;:&#8201;Ni atomic ratio from 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 to 3&#8201;:&#8201;1) and morphologies (evolution from nanobranches to nanoparticles) are generated. The prepared Pt48Ni52 alloy, which has a composite morphology comprised of nanobranches and nanoparticles, exhibits superior activity and durability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater compared to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst and other PtNi alloys that have different compositions and morphologies. The excellent seawater HER performance of Pt48Ni52 is ascribed to its nanobranch/nanoparticle morphology that optimally facilitates electron accumulation on Pt, which enhances resistance to chloride corrosion in seawater.

         <title>Bright Organic Mechanoluminescence and Remarkable Mechanofluorochromism from Circularly Polarized TADF Enantiomers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of organic enantiomers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission and circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties have been developed successfully. Furthermore, it is found that their crystals can emit strong blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence and produce bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence and remarkable mechanofluorochromism under the stimuli of force.







Abstract
The development of circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) luminogens with stimuli&#8208;response characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a pair of organic enantiomers, S&#8208;CzTA and R&#8208;CzTA, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, have been successfully developed by introducing chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene and carbazole to phthalimide. They present CP&#8208;TADF properties in toluene solutions, giving dissymmetric factors of 0.84&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;1.03&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. In the crystalline state, both S&#8208;CzTA and R&#8208;CzTA can emit intense blue TADF and produce very bright sky&#8208;blue mechanoluminescence (ML) and remarkable mechanofluorochromism (MFC) under the stimuli of mechanical force. Single&#8208;crystal analysis and theoretical calculation results suggest that their ML activities are probably associated with their chiral and polar molecular structures and unique non&#8208;centrosymmetric molecular packing modes. Furthermore, the MFC properties of the enantiomers likely originate from the destruction of crystal structure, leading to the planarization of molecular conformation. This work may provide helpful guidance for developing new CP&#8208;TADF materials with force&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Closed Bipolar Electrode Array for Optical Reporting Reaction&#8208;Coupled Electrochemical Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powerful sensing and imaging abilities: This review highlights the recent advances in closed bipolar electrode (BPE) arrays using an electro&#8208;fluorochromism (EFC) or electro&#8208;chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction to realize sensing and imaging. It demonstrates the advantages of a closed BPE array, such as the physical separation of two poles, the independence of each electrode, and the simplicity and controllability of the system.







Abstract
This review centers on a closed bipolar electrode (BPE) array using an electro&#8208;fluorochromism (EFC) or electro&#8208;chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction as the reporting reaction. Electrochemical signals at one pole of the closed BPE array can be transduced into the EFC or ECL signals at the opposite pole. Therefore, the current signal of a redox reaction can be easily detected and imaged by monitoring the luminescence signal. Recent developments in closed BPE array&#8208;based EFC and ECL sensing and imaging are summarized and discussed in detail. Finally, we consider the challenges and opportunities for improving the spatial resolution of closed BPE array&#8208;based electrochemical imaging, and emphasize the important application of this technique to the imaging of cellular activities at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Unveiling the Metal Incorporation Effect of Steady&#8208;Active FeP Hydrogen Evolution Nanocatalysts for Water Electrolyzer</title>

This work reports the homogeneous incorporation of Co into the FeP host to promote both activity and stability of HER for the PEMWE application and demonstrates the probable origin of the high performance by ex situ experiments.







Abstract
Metal phosphides are promising noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but they usually suffer from inferior stability and thus are far from the device applications. We reported a facile and controllable synthetic method to prepare metal&#8208;incorporated M&#8208;FeP nanoparticles (M=Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Mo) with the guide of the density functional theory (DFT). The evaluated HER activity sequence was consistent with the DFT predictions, and cobalt was revealed to be the appropriate dopant. With the optimization of the Co/Fe ratio, the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C only required overpotentials of 67&#8197;mV and 129&#8197;mV to obtain the cathodic current density of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. It maintained the initial activity in the 10&#8197;h stability test, surpassing the other Co&#8208;FeP/C catalysts. Ex situ experiments demonstrated that the decreased element leaching and the increased surface phosphide content contributed to the high stability of the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer was assembled using the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C as the cathodic catalyst. It showed a current density of 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied voltage of 2.0&#8197;V and retained the initial activity in the 1000 cycles&#8217; stability test, suggesting the potential application of the catalysts.

A competitive evaluation of the DalPhos ligand family in nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings involving a diverse set of test nucleophiles, electrophiles, solvents, and bases enabled the development of the first metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of aminopyrazoles and related heteroatom&#8208;dense nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides using an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.







Abstract
A systematic competitive evaluation of the DalPhos ligand family in nickel&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation chemistry is reported, involving primary (linear and branched) and secondary alkylamines, as well as a primary five&#8208;membered heteroarylamine (aminopyrazole), in combination with a diverse set of test electrophiles and bases (NaOtBu, K2CO3, DBU/NaTFA). In addition to providing optimal ligand/catalyst identification, and bringing to light methodology limitations (e.&#8201;g., unwanted C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling with NaOtBu), our survey enabled the development of the first efficient catalyst system for heteroatom&#8208;dense C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of aminopyrazoles and related nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides by use of an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.

         <title>Modulating the G&#8208;Quadruplex and Duplex DNA Binding by Controlling the Charge of Fluorescent Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules being either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged have been investigated as DNA binders. Both molecules show a moderate binding to G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA structures whereas the interaction is governed by the overall charge of the ligands.







Abstract
Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules bearing either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged moieties attached to the same aromatic structure have been investigated as binders for DNA. The novel Spiro&#8208;NMe3 containing four alkylammonium substituents interacts with G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures and shows preference for G4s over duplex by means of FRET melting and fluorescence experiments. The interaction is governed by the charged substituents of the ligands as deduced from the lower binding of the sulfonate analogue (Spiro&#8208;SO3). On the contrary, Spiro&#8208;SO3 exhibits higher binding affinity to duplex DNA structure than to G4. Both molecules show a moderate quenching of the fluorescence upon DNA binding. The confocal microscopy evaluation shows the internalization of both molecules in HeLa cells and their lysosomal accumulation.

         <title>Synthesis of Isomeric Tb3+&#8208;Phthalocyanine Double&#8208;Decker Complexes Depending on the Difference in the Direction of Coordination Plane and Their Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C4h symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine was employed to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes. (S,S), (R,R), and meso isomers were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of the two C4h&#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. It was demonstrated that the meso isomer showed higher energy for spin reversal (Ueff) than those of the enantiomers (S,S and R,R).







Abstract
A C4h symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine, 1,8,15,22&#8208;tertrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;oxy)phthalocyanine (H2TdMPPc), was used to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes ([Tb(TdMPPc)2]s). Because H2TdMPPc has C4h symmetry, S,S, R,R, and meso isomers of [Tb(TdMPPc)2] were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of two C4h&#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. We investigated the physical properties of these [Tb(TdMPPc)2] isomers, including their single&#8208;ion magnetic properties, and found that the spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier (Ueff) of the meso isomer was apparently higher than that of the enantiomers. Detailed crystal structural analyses indicated that the meso isomer has a more symmetrical structure than do the enantiomers, thereby suggesting that the higher Ueff of the meso isomer originated from the more highly symmetrical structure.

         <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Methyl Heteroarenes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles was first reported. A series of di&#8208;heteroaryl ketones (26 examples) were obtained in moderate yields (up to 72&#8201;% yield), providing a highly atom&#8208;economic approach for synthesizing complex pharmaceutical intermediates from small molecules. A plausible mechanism about cyclic catalysis was proposed and confirmed.







Abstract
Direct oxidative coupling of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been a great challenge. Herein, an environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles is reported. A variety of diheteroaryl ketones were prepared in good yields (up to 72&#8201;%). This protocol features simple operation and broad substrates scope (26 examples). Significantly, a plausible mechanism about catalytic cycle was proposed, and two key intermediates were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers Toward Amines Oxidation Coupled with H2O2 Generation via Extending Monomer's Conjugation Degree</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light driven amines oxidation coupled with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation is a promising way to convert solar energy to chemical energy. Herein, a series of hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) photocatalysts with different arenes monomers, including benzene (BE), diphenyl (DP), p&#8208;terphenyl (TP), or p&#8208;quaterphenyl (QP), were synthesized via simple Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction. Owing to the maximum monomers&#8217; conjunction degree and excellent oxygen (O2) adsorption capacity, QP&#8208;HCPs exhibited highest photocatalytic activity for benzylamine oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation under the irradiation of 455 nm Blue LED lamp. More than 99% of benzylamine could be converted to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine within 60 min. In addition, nearly stoichiometric H2O2 was synchronously obtained with a high production rate of 9.3 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Our work not only demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of HCPs photocatalysts significantly depends on monomer&#8217;s conjunction degree, but also provided a new strategy for converting solar energy to chemical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Mannich&#8208;type Reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to Ketimines: A Direct Entry to Unprotected &#946;2,3,3&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been developed. This process allows direct access to &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers, which cannot be formed in analogous catalytic reactions. The silyl&#8208;protected carboxylic acid generated from acrylic acid and a hydrosilane indicates a good affinity with CuH catalysis than other alkenes to form the copper enolate dominantly.







Abstract
Stereoselective construction of unprotected &#946;&#8208;amino acids is a significant challenge owing to the lack of methods for the catalytic generation of highly enantioenriched carboxylic acid enolates. In this study, a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed, which provides a direct and scalable synthetic method for enantioenriched &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers. The protocol features in&#8197;situ generation of transiently protected carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane and their diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling with ketimines. The synthetic utility of this process was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Ferrocene&#8208;Based Diol Library and Application in the Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a library of ferrocenyl diols, establishing a fundamental structure&#8211;activity relationship through a modular three&#8208;to&#8208;four&#8208;step synthesis is described. These diols are prepared with complete enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity across seven chiral elements (2 planes, 2 centres, and 3 axes) and are catalytically active in the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography shows intricate inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, as well as uncommon bifurcated hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Diol scaffolds have been utilized as highly effective catalysts and ligands in a wide range of catalytic asymmetric transformations. For scaffolds to be successful as broadly used motifs, they should be prepared cheaply through facile routes and be easily handled. Herein, the synthesis of a family of planar chiral diols based on a modular and robust three&#8208;step route is described, which yields catalytically active diols in &gt;99&#8201;% de and &gt;99&#8201;% ee, with up to seven different chiral elements. These diols have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which provides clear evidence for the likely transition state when applied in the asymmetric hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Without altering the stereochemistry of the catalyst backbone, it is possible to access both enantiomers of the product by varying the substitution of the catalyst at the &#945;&#8208;position.

         <title>Identification of Isonitrile&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Complex Biological Matrices through Ligation with Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trifunctional probe consisting of a chlorooxime, a bromine mass tag, and a UV tag facilitated the detection, isolation, and structure elucidation of isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products in microgram quantities in cyanobacteria and a rare marine sponge.







Abstract
Isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products have garnered attention for their manifold bioactivities but are difficult to detect and isolate due to the chemical lability of the isonitrile functional group. Here, we used the isonitrile&#8208;chlorooxime ligation (INC) in a reactivity&#8208;based screening (RBS) protocol for the detection and isolation of alkaloid and terpene isonitriles in the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua and a marine sponge of the order Bubarida, respectively. A trifunctional probe bearing a chlorooxime moiety, a UV active aromatic moiety, and a bromine label facilitated the chemoselective reaction with isonitriles, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic detection, and mass spectrometric analysis. The INC&#8208;based RBS allowed for the detection, isolation, and structural elucidation of isonitriles in microgram quantities.

         <title>Phospholenes from Phosphabenzenes by Selective Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to shrink the ring: Amino&#8208;functionalized phosphabenzenes can undergo a selective and quantitative ring contraction reaction to give phospholene derivatives. The special electronic properties of the aromatic phosphorus heterocycles, in combination with their particular reactivity, allow sequential reactions, in contrast to functionalized pyridines.







Abstract
A 3&#8208;amino&#8208;functionalized phosphabenzene (phosphinine) has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The pyramidalized nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino substituent indicates only a weak interaction between the lone pair of the nitrogen atom and the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle, resulting in somewhat basic character. It turned out that the amino group can indeed be protonated by HCl. In contrast to pyridines, however, the phosphabenzene&#8208;ammonium salt undergoes a selective ring contraction to form a hydroxylphospholene oxide in the presence of additional water. Based on deuterium labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, a rational mechanism for this hitherto unknown conversion is proposed.

         <title>Sustainable Production of Molybdenum Carbide (MXene) from Fruit Wastes for Improved Solar Evaporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable novel synthesis of food waste conversion into molybdenum carbide samples for improved solar evaporation performances.







Abstract
Freshwater production using solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation is regarded as a green and sustainable strategy. The biggest barrier to practical deployment of solar desalination, however, continues to be the lack of options for renewable materials. Herein, we present a facile two&#8208;step carbonization approach that is sustainable for developing innovative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) materials derived from carbonized fruit wastes. The resultant 2D Mo2C photothermal layer has an efficient water evaporation rate of 1.52&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation, which is among the best reported values so far. The broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area (555.1&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) with large micro&#8208; and meso porosity, of the Mo2C photothermal layer are responsible for these outstanding results. The conversion of food wastes into valuable products, in this case MXene, can potentially inspire greener developments of advanced materials for solar water evaporator.

Integration of Dy(III) hexaazamacrocycle, azido and chirality produces the first chiral all&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Dy&#8208;SMMs.







Abstract
Two pairs of chiral end&#8208;on azido&#8208;bridged dinuclear hexaazamacrocycles, [Dy2(LN6R/S)2(N3)2Cl2](BPh4)2 (1R/1S) and [Dy2(LN6R/S)2(N3)4]Cl2 (2R/2S) (LN6R/S is hexaazamacrocyclic neutral Schiff base ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine and (1R, 2R)/(1S, 2S)&#8208;diaminocyclohexane), were constructed by adjusting the molar ratio of sodium azide to Dy(III) macrocycle precursor. Structural analyses reveal that all Dy(III) centers in complexes 1R/1S and 2R/2S are nine&#8208;coordinate with hula&#8208;loop coordination geometry, and the differences between 1R/1S and 2R/2S are the terminal coordination anion and counter anion. Magnetic studies indicate that complex 2S displays typical SMM behaviors under a zero dc field, whereas 1S just shows slow relaxation of magnetization resulting from a relatively weak axial crystal field. Significantly, complex 2R/2S represents the first homochiral all&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnet.

         <title>Rapid 18F&#8208; and 19F&#8208;Difluoromethylation through Desulfurative Fluorination of Transient N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208;Linked Dithioles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New opportunities for radiochemists: The AgF&#8208;promoted desulfurative fluorination of dithioles can lead to difluoromethylation. DMBDT&#8208;BF4 and DMBDT&#8208;OMe were identified as readily available and versatile reagents for the functionalization of alcohols and heterocycles during which DMBDT undergoes rapid desulfurative fluorination. Furthermore, Ag18F can be used to incorporate radioactive groups into structurally complex and pharmaceutically relevant molecules.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl group plays an important role in modern medicinal and agrochemistry. While several difluoromethylation reagents have been reported, these typically rely on difluoromethyl carbenes or anions, or target specific processes. Here, we describe a conceptually unique and general process for O&#8722;H, N&#8722;H and C&#8722;H difluoromethylation that involves the formation of a transient dithiole followed by facile desulfurative fluorination using silver(I) fluoride. We also introduce the 5,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzodithiole (DMBDT) function, which undergoes sufficiently rapid desulfurative fluorination to additionally support 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation. This new process is compatible with the wide range of functional groups typically encountered in medicinal chemistry campaigns, and the use of Ag18F is demonstrated in the production of 18F&#8208;labeled derivatives of testosterone, perphenazine, and melatonin, 58.0&#177;2.2, 20.4&#177;0.3 and 32.2&#177;3.6&#8197;MBq&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1, respectively. We expect that the DMBDT group and this 18F/19F&#8208;difluoromethylation process will inspire and support new efforts in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and radiotracer production.

         <title>Modular Peptide Probe for Protein Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular peptide probes with good selectivity and high affinity have attracted numerous attentions for the analysis and regulation of proteins with complex structure and complicated analytical environment. In this review, the design and optimization strategies of modular peptide probes and their research progress of their applications in the field of protein analysis are reviewed.







Abstract
The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Nowadays, ascribing to the editability and bioactivity of peptides, peptide&#8208;based probes could meet the requirements of good selectivity and high affinity to overcome the challenges. In this review, we summarize the advances in the use of modular peptide probes for proteins analysis. It focuses on how to design and optimize the structure of probes, as well as their performance. Then, the strategies and application to improve the analysis result of modular peptide probes are introduced. Finally, we also discuss current challenge and provide some ideas for the future direction for modular peptide probes, hoping to accelerate their clinical transformation.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Foldamers with Axial Chirality: Chiroptical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the construction of chiral foldamers and their chiroptical properties. Fabrication, properties and application of the rotatable folded systems with respect to the generation of axial chirality, the regulation of folding behavior and the evolution of chiroptical properties are illustrated. Furthermore, the applications of chiral foldamers in optical chirality sensing and asymmetric synthesis are briefly introduced.







Abstract
Folding phenomenon refers to the formation of a specific conformation widely featured by the intramolecular interactions, which broadly exist in biomacromolecules, and are closely related to their structures and functions. A variety of oligomeric folded molecules have been designed and synthesized, namely &#8220;foldamer&#8221;, exhibiting potentials in pharmaceutical and catalysis. Molecular folding is a promising strategy to transfer chirality from substituents to the whole skeleton, when chirality transfer, amplification, evolution, and other behaviors could be achieved. Investigating chirality using foldamer model deepens the understanding of the structure&#8208;function correlation in biomacromolecules and expands the molecular toolbox towards chiroptical and asymmetrical chemistry. Substitutes with abundant hydrogen bonding sites conjugated to a rotatable aryl group afford a parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like conformation, which enables the emergence and manipulation of axial chirality. This concept aims to give a brief introduction and summary of the hydrogen bonded foldamers with anchored axial chirality, by taking some recent cases as examples. Design principles, control over axial chirality and applications are also reviewed.

         <title>Ionic &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) Nanocrystal Stabilized by Small Isopolymolybdate Clusters as Reactive Core for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dare to be bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH): While the iron catalysts are susceptible to hydrolytic dissociation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide, [MoxOy]n&#8722; cluster ions, in&#8197;situ derived from a small isolable {31} atom containing Anderson polyoxometalate ([Mo7O24]6&#8722;), protect a &lt;10&#8197;nm iron&#8208;oxide nanocore in water. The POM clusters prevent the spontaneous aggregation of the iron oxy&#8208;hydroxide nanocore making the core highly reactive for electrochemical water&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
At near neutral to basic pH, hydrolysis&#8208;induced aggregation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide is often regarded as the pitfalls of molecular iron clusters. Iron&#8208;oxide nanocrystals are encouragingly active over the molecular clusters and/or bulk oxides albeit, stabilizing such nanostructures in aqueous pH and under turnover condition remain a perdurable challenge. Herein, an Anderson&#8208;type [Mo7O24]6&#8722; isopolyanion, a small (dimension ca. 0.85&#8197;nm) isolable polyoxometalate (POM) possessing only {31} atoms, has been introduced for the first time as a covalent linker to stabilize an infinitely stable and aqueous&#8208;soluble &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo7O24]6&#8722; may lead to the in&#8197;situ generation of few analogous [MoxOy]n&#8722; clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, MoxOy@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [MoxOy]n&#8722;, they are covalently linked via MoVI&#8208;&#956;2O&#8208;FeIII bridging to &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core in MoxOy@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidence. Such bonding mode is more likely as precedent from the coordination motif documented in the transition metal clusters stabilized by this POM. The &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore of MoxOy@FeO(OH) behaves as potent active center for electrochemical water oxidation with a overpotential, 263&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lower than that observed for bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH). Despite of some molybdenum dissolution from the POM ligands to the electrolyte, residual anionic POM fragments covalently bound to the OER active &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core of the MoxOy@FeO(OH) makes the surface predominantly ionic that results in an ordered electrical double layer to promote a better charge transport across the electrode&#8208;electrolyte junction, less likely in bulk &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH).

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions in Halogenated Pyridinium Salts of the Weakly Coordinating Anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and structural characterization of the perhalogenated pyridinium cations [C5F5NH]+ and [C5F4ClNH]+ and the dimeric cations [(C5F5N)2H]+ and [(C5Cl5N)2H]+ as [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722; salts are presented. These cations show noncovalent interactions with the weakly coordinating anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722; such as strong fluorine specific interactions as well as &#963;&#8208;hole and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis and the first structural characterization of the halogenated pyridinium salts [C5F5NH]+, [C5F4ClNH]+, [(C5F5N)2H]+, [(C5Cl5N)2H]+ of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;, showing noncovalent interactions in the solid state, are presented. The salts were characterized by the multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction. Hirshfeld surface analysis and solid state structures reveal various intermolecular anion&#8208;&#960; and &#963;&#8208;hole interactions between the corresponding halogenated pyridinium cations and the anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722;.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Borylation and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling to Give Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One step! Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective one&#8208;step borylation of glycosyl bromides to &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates has been developed. In addition, Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of thus&#8208;obtained &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates with aryl bromides to various aryl &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides have been achieved.







Abstract
Metabolically stable C&#8208;glycosides are an essential family of compounds in bioactive natural products, therapeutic agents, and biological probes. For their application, development of synthetic methods by connecting glycosides and aglycons with strict stereocontrol at the anomeric carbon, as well as with high functional&#8208;group compatibility and environmental compatibility is a pivotal issue. Although Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling using glycosyl boronates is a potential candidate for the construction of C&#8208;glycosides, neither the cross&#8208;coupling itself nor the facile synthesis of the coupling precursor, glycosyl boronates, have been achieved to date. Herein, it was succeeded to develop a copper&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective one&#8208;step borylation of glycosyl bromides to glycosyl boronates and palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates with aryl bromides to give aryl &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, in which the &#946;&#8208;configuration of the anomeric carbon of the glycosyl trifluoroborates is stereoretentively transferred to that of the resulting aryl C&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Chiroptical Activity of An Achiral Emissive Eu Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiroptical activity of achiral crystals is theoretically allowed but very unusual. There is a particularly scarcity of empirical studies on optically active achiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein we report an achiral emissive Eu MOF and its chiroptical properties both in the ground and excited states. The framework crystallizes in an achiral space group (Pna21) belonging to the polar point group (mm2), where the asymmetric arrangement of racemic trinuclear Eu&#8208;oxo clusters is responsible for the optical activity. A pair of circular dichroisms (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks with opposite signs were observed for single crystals. Importantly, the luminescence dissymmetry factor can reach up to 1.1&#215;10 &#8211; 3, which is comparable in magnitude to the value of most of the chiral&#8208;linker&#8208;bridged MOFs. This work gives the first example of achiral MOFs with CPL response and should be instructive for the discovery of more CPL emitters from racemic MOF family.</dc:description>

         <title>Finding a Deep&#8208;UV Borate BaZnB4O8 with Edge&#8208;sharing [BO4] Tetrahedra and Strong Optical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a new congruently melting polyborate with extremely large birefringence (&#916;n(001)=0.14@589.3&#8197;nm) and band gap (6.89&#8197;eV) is discovered as a high performance birefringent crystal, which breaks the current deadlock of deep&#8208;UV polyborates that usually show small birefringence.







Abstract
The polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is an important process that incorporates functionality to selectively respond to light&#8208;mater interaction. Typically, optical anisotropy is foremost to the use efficiency of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals. Herein, a new congruently melting polyborate with extremely large birefringence (&#916;n(001)=0.14@589.3&#8197;nm) and band gap (6.89&#8197;eV) is discovered as a high performance birefringent crystal, which breaks the current deadlock of deep&#8208;UV polyborates that usually show small birefringence. The rigid tetrahedra, including [ZnO4] and edge&#8208;sharing [BO4] tetrahedra, make all the planar [BO3] triangles in the lattice adopt preferential arrangement and thereby lead to an extraordinary large birefringence that is larger than all the deep&#8208;UV borates with experimentally measured values. Structural analyses with the additional theoretical calculations were used to study the origin of strong optical anisotropy in BaZnB4O8.

         <title>IR/UV Double Resonance Study of the 2&#8208;Phenylallyl Radical and its Pyrolysis Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolated 2&#8208;phenylallyl radicals (2&#8208;PA), C  9  H  9  , generated by pyrolysis from a nitrite precursor, have been investigated by IR/UV ion dip spectroscopy using free electron laser radiation. 2&#8208;PA is a resonance&#8208;stabilized radical that is considered to be involved in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in combustion, but also in interstellar space. The radical is identified based on its gas&#8208;phase IR spectrum. Furthermore, a number of bimolecular reaction products are identified, showing that the self&#8208;reaction as well as reactions with unimolecular decomposition products of 2&#8208;PA form several PAH efficiently. Possible mechanisms are discussed and the chemistry of 2&#8208;PA is compared with the one of the related 2&#8208;methylallyl and phenylpropargyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Sandwiched Nanochannel Aptasensor for Efficiently Screening Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer cells are a class of important tumor biomarkers and are closely related to tumorous progression. It is urgent to develop a sensitive and highly efficient method for the rapid and accurate detection of cancer cells. Herein, an aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was established for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. By virtue of the porous nanochannels as the filter platform and immobilized with DNA aptamers for specifically capturing the cancer cells, the nanochannel&#8208;based electrochemical sensor denotes excellent performance for MCF&#8208;7 screening, and allowing a low limit of detection of 36 cells&#8226;mL&#8208;1. The nanochannels&#8208;based sandwich structure aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides great advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Functional Groups Induced Tuning MOFs&#8217; 2D into 1D Pore Channels for Pipeline Natural Gas Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the ligand functionalized by the NH2 group or Cl atom, the 2D &#8220;zigzag&#8221; pore channel of a new pillar&#8208;layer tfz&#8208;d&#8208;MOF based upon the [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(COO)6(NC5H4)4] cluster was finely tuned to be the 2D &#8220;straight&#8221; one or the 1D &#8220;straight&#8221; one, respectively. Experiments and simulations of three isostructural MOFs further revealed that the selective C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 adsorptions were apparently improved because of their structural changes of pore channels. For the first time, tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs with strengthened host&#8211;guest interactions in the gas adsorption and separation was demonstrated by our work.







Abstract
The solvothermal reactions of CoCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, 3,5&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (H2L) and isonicotinic acid (HL1)/3&#8208;amino isonicotinic acid (HL2)/3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid (HL3) successfully led to three tfz&#8208;d topological pillar&#8208;layer [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(COO)6(NC5H4)4] cluster&#8208;based MOFs, namely, [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L1)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMA]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai76, SNNU&#8208;Bai=Shaanxi Normal University Bai's group), [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L2)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai77) and [Co4(&#956;&#8208;F)2(L)2(L3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SNNU&#8208;Bai78). With the 2D pore channels in SNNU&#8208;Bai76 and SNNU&#8208;Bai77 being tuned to the 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78, C3H8 and C2H6 adsorption uptakes are apparently improved and the IAST selectivities of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 almost remain, which indicate that SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may be one potential separation material for the pipeline natural gas purification. These were further confirmed by the breakthrough experiments for the simulated pipeline natural gas (C3H8/C2H6/CH4&#8201;:&#8201;5/10/85 gas mixture) of three isostructural MOFs. Furthermore, GCMC simulations revealed that due to one of the pore channels blocked by Cl atoms in a couple of 3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid with the changed conformation as the pillar, the pore wall of the formed 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may interact with the adsorbed C3H8 or C2H6 molecule more strongly, for which more atoms of framework at the new adsorption site will interact with the adsorbed gas molecule by more intermolecular interactions. This was also evidenced by the increased binding energies, being consistent with the tuning of adsorption enthalpies for C3H8 and C2H6 gas molecules, and the reduced C3H8 and C2H6 gas diffusion coefficients in SNNU&#8208;Bai78. Very interestingly, this work is the first example of finely tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs toward strengthened host&#8211;guest interactions for the gas adsorption and separation.

With the 2D pore channels in SNNU-Bai76 and SNNU-Bai77 being tuned to the 1D pore channel in SNNU-Bai78, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption uptakes are apparently improved and the IAST selectivities of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; almost remain, which indicate that SNNU-Bai78 may be one potential separation material for the pipeline natural gas purification. These were further confirmed by the breakthrough experiments for the simulated pipeline natural gas (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;5/10/85 gas mixture) of three isostructural MOFs. Furthermore, GCMC simulations revealed that due to one of the pore channels blocked by Cl atoms in a couple of 3-chloro isonicotinic acid with the changed conformation as the pillar, the pore wall of the formed 1D pore channel in SNNU-Bai78 may interact with the adsorbed C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; molecule more strongly, for which more atoms of framework at the new adsorption site will interact with the adsorbed gas molecule by more intermolecular interactions. This was also evidenced by the increased binding energies, being consistent with the tuning of adsorption enthalpies for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas molecules, and the reduced C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas diffusion coefficients in SNNU-Bai78. Very interestingly, this work is the first example of finely tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs toward strengthened host&#8211;guest interactions for the gas adsorption and separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overclocking Nitronyl Nitroxide Gold Derivatives in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study resolved a problem in Pd&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of metalloorganic derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide with bromoarenes. The finding opens a new pathway to various in&#8208;demand nitronyl nitroxides for different fields of research such as creation of high&#8208;spin systems, molecule&#8208;based magnets and molecular units for spintronics.







Abstract
Nitronyl nitroxides are functional building blocks in cutting&#8208;edge research fields, such as the design of molecular magnets, the development of redox and photoswitchable molecular systems and the creation of redox&#8208;active components for organic and hybrid batteries. The key importance of the nitronyl nitroxide function is to translate molecular&#8208;level&#8208;optimized structures into nano&#8208;scale devices and new technologies. In spite of great importance, efficient and versatile synthetic approaches to these compounds still represent a challenge. Particularly, methods for the direct introduction of a nitronyl nitroxide moiety into aromatic systems possess many limitations. Here, we report gold derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide that can enter Pd(0)&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with various aryl bromides, affording the corresponding functionalized nitronyl nitroxides. Based on the high thermal stability and enhanced reactivity in catalytic transformation, a new reagent is suggested for the synthesis of radical systems via a universal cross&#8208;coupling approach.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Ultrabright and Dendritic Xanthenes for Enhanced Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Based Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and divergent synthetic route that provides ready&#8208;to&#8208;click pH&#8208;insensitive rhodamine dyes exhibiting outstanding brightness was developed. In EdU cell proliferation assays, our 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine rhodamine azide outperformed the popular 5&#8208;TAMRA&#8208;azide. A set of bis&#8208;MPA dendrons carrying multiple fluorescein or our rhodamine revealed self&#8208;quenching effects, suggesting potential application as FRET quenchers.







Abstract
Biorthogonal labelling with fluorescent small molecules is an indispensable tool for diagnostic and biomedical applications. In dye&#8208;based 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (EdU) cell proliferation assays, augmentation of the fluorescent signal entails an overall enhancement in the sensitivity and quality of the method. To this end, a rapid, divergent synthetic procedure that provides ready&#8208;to&#8208;click pH&#8208;insensitive rhodamine dyes exhibiting outstanding brightness was established. Compared to the shortest available synthesis of related high quantum&#8208;yielding rhodamines, two fewer synthetic steps are required. In a head&#8208;to&#8208;head imaging comparison involving copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition reactions with in vitro administered EdU, our new 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine rhodamine azide outperformed the popular 5&#8208;TAMRA&#8208;azide, making it among the best available choices when it comes to fluorescent imaging of DNA. In a further exploration of the fluorescence properties of these dyes, a set of bis&#8208;MPA dendrons carrying multiple fluorescein or rhodamine units was prepared by branching click chemistry. Fluorescence self&#8208;quenching of fluorescein&#8208; and rhodamine&#8208;functionalized dendrons limited the suitability of the dyes as labels in EdU&#8208;based experiments but provided new insights into these effects.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Readout of the Mechanical Response of a Bis&#8208;acridinium [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two orthogonal stimuli, namely electrons and hydroxide ions, were used to probe the mechanical response in a bis&#8208;acridinium rotaxane. Like the yin&#8208;yang representing two opposite but complementary forces, both stimuli trigger opposite mechanical behavior and provide complementary readouts. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Heitz, H.&#8208;P. Jacquot&#8197;de&#8197;Rouville and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202840).

         <title>The Insertion of EII and EIV Chlorides (E=Si, Ge) into the Si&#8722;Si Bond of Disilylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of silylene :SiCl2 into the Si&#8722;Si bond of a phosphinoamidinate&#8208;supported disilylene affords a SiCl2&#8208;bridged bis(silylene) that, upon heating, rearranges into a silyl&#8208;substituted disilylene. Analogous insertion of GeCl2 leads directly to a silyl&#8208;substituted silylene&#8208;germylene derivative. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;F. Vyboishchikov, G.&#8197;I. Nikonov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202799).

         <title>Readily Accessible Strained Difunctionalized trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes with Fast Click and Release Capabilities
</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel strained difunctionalized trans&#8208;cyclooctene in only four high&#8208;yielding steps is presented and the releasing capabilities of functionalized derivatives were evaluated upon tetrazine activation. This method presents a major step forward in the ease and efficiency of synthesizing releasing difunctionalized trans&#8208;cyclooctenes.







Abstract
The click reaction between a functionalized trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and a tetrazine (Tz) is a compelling method for bioorthogonal conjugation in combination with payload releasing capabilities. However, the synthesis of difunctionalized TCOs remains challenging. As a result, these compounds are poorly accessible, which impedes the development of novel applications. In this work, the scalable and accessible synthesis of a new bioorthogonal difunctionalized TCO is reported in only four single selective high yielding steps starting from commercially available compounds. The TCO&#8208;Tz click reaction was assessed and revealed excellent kinetic rates and subsequently payload release was shown with various functionalized derivatives. Tetrazine triggered release of carbonate and carbamate payloads was demonstrated up to 100&#8201;% release efficiency and local drug release was shown in a cellular toxicity study which revealed a &gt;20&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Syntheses of (+)&#8208;Mycaperoxides C, D, G Methyl Ester and (&#8722;)&#8208;Mycaperoxide B
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Totally expanded. (+)&#8208;Mycaperoxides D, C, G methyl ester, and (&#8722;)&#8208;mycaperoxide B were synthesized in 11 to 15 steps for the first time. A stereodivergent approach from sclareol was adopted, highlighting ring expansion of strain cyclobutanol into 1,2&#8208;dioxane, and Mukaiyama aldol reaction on peroxycarbenium species to install the propionic acid subunit.







Abstract
Mycaperoxides are natural endoperoxides isolated from different Mycale genus sponges, showing significant antiviral or antibacterial activities. We report herein the first total syntheses of representative congeners of this family from sclareol using a stereodivergent approach. Thus, an innovative oxidative ring expansion of cyclobutanol was used to bring the 1,2&#8208;dioxane subunit, and a Mukaiyama aldol reaction on peroxycarbenium species was utilized to install the propionic acid subunit. During the study toward (+)&#8208;mycaperoxide D methyl ester (2), the isolation of the eight possible diastereomers under their ethyl thioester form allowed to build a pertinent database for further NMR assignment studies. Thus, we completed the total syntheses of (+)&#8208;mycaperoxides D, C, G methyl ester, and (&#8722;)&#8208;mycaperoxide B in 11 to 15 steps, confirming their original assignment.

         <title>Direct Aroylation of Olefins through a Cobalt/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative and Dehydrogenative Coupling with &#945;&#8208;Oxo Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy between two catalysts and blue light is depicted giving rise to enones. The acridinium photocatalyst provides electrons to a cobaloxime catalyst, pictured receiving electrons within the lightbulb. This interaction liberates the small molecules hydrogen and carbon dioxide, shown as evolving from the lightbulb. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;A. Tunge and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202781).

         <title>One&#8208;pot synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite by solid&#8208;state method and its MTO Catalytic performance</title>

         <dc:description>The traditional hydrothermal synthesis strategy of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is energy&#8208;consumption accompanying by pollution issues. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;modified layered ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites (PZ) were obtained by one&#8208;pot synthesis under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The synthesized samples were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, NH3&#8208;TPD and FTIR. The effect of phosphorus addition on the morphology and catalytic activity of ZSM&#8208;5 was investigated. The results showed that phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin (ethylene and propylene) selectivity (above 50%) and longer catalytic lifetime (33 h) in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4 h&#8208;1. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite synthesized by in&#8208;situ solvent&#8208;free method, which not only reduced the discharge of sewage but also showed a simple method to realize the introduction of phosphorous species, which provided a new idea for phosphorus modification of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomineralized Piezoelectrically Active Scaffolds for Inducing Osteogenic Differentiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self&#8208;powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three&#8208;dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three&#8208;dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric PVDF&#8208;HFP and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating. The preferred scaffold has an open circuit voltage and short circuit current output of 5 V and 200 nA. Combining the physical and chemical properties of the CaP coating, the piezoelectric signal of PVDF&#8208;HFP and the three&#8208;dimensional structure of PUF, the scaffold exhibits superior promotion of cell osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation in vivo. The mechanism is attributed to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to chemical and piezoelectric stimulation with the material. This research not only paves the way for the application of piezoelectric scaffolds to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation in situ, but also laid the foundation for the clinical treatment of long&#8208;term osteoporosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Solvent and Thermal Stability in Cross&#8208;Linkable Conjugated Statistical Copolymers for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device&#8208;related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208;stat&#8208;poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross&#8208;linkable hydroxyl groups are synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT thin films in their as&#8208;cast state crystallize well in an edge&#8208;on orientation. During annealing at 150 &#186;C, these P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT occur cross&#8208;linking and retain edge&#8208;on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high&#8208;temperature annealing at 300 &#186;C, their edge&#8208;on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross&#8208;linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state. The correlation between different P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT and their charge mobilities is scrutinized. These cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in OFETs. Conceptually, such side&#8208;chain functionalization approach to improve the stability of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT can be conveniently extended to other conjugated polymers for diverse optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic Drugs as a Tool for Protein Structure Solving and Studies on Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic drugs are capable of tight interactions with proteins through coordination towards aminoacidic residues, and this feature is recognized as a key aspect for their pharmacological action. However, the &#8220;protein metalation process&#8221; is exploitable for solving the phase problem and structural resolution. In fact, the use of inorganic drugs bearing specific metal centers and ligands capable to drive the binding towards the desired portions of the protein target could represent a very intriguing and fruitful strategy. In this context, a theoretical approach may further contribute to solve protein structures and their refinement. Here, we delineate the main features of a reliable experimental&#8208;theoretical integrated approach, based on the use of metallodrugs, for protein structures solving.</dc:description>

         <title>LiHMDS&#8208;mediated deprotonative coupling of toluenes with ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones to afford stilbenes. Various functionalities (halogen, OCF3, amide, Me, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, SMe, and SPh) are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (~43, DMSO).</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design and Crystal Chemistry of Polyfluorinated Naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides with Superior Thermal and Polymorphic Stability and High Solution Processability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimides (NDIs) are highly promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type molecular semiconductor candidates for flexible and cost&#8208;effective organic solar cells and thermoelectrics. Nonetheless, thermal and polymorphic stabilities of environmentally stable NDIs in the low&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature regime (&lt;300&#176;C) remain challenging properties. Structural, thermal, spectroscopic and computational features of polyfluorinated NDI&#8208;based molecular solids (with up to 14 F atoms per NDI molecule) are discussed upon increasing the fluorination level. Slip&#8208;stacked arrangement of the NDI cores with suitable p&#8211;p stacking and systematically short interplanar distances (&lt; 3.2 &#197;) are found. All these materials exhibit superior thermal stability (up to 260 &#176;C or above) and thermal expansion coefficients indicating a response compatible with flexible polymeric substrates, Optical band&#8208;gaps increase from 2.78 to 2.93 eV with fluorination, while LUMO energy levels decrease down to &#8208;4.37 eV, as per DFT calculations. The compounds exhibit excellent solubility of 30 mg mL&#8208;1 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane and DMF.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As important post&#8208;transcriptional regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play irreplaceable roles in diverse cellular functions. Dysregulated miRNA expression is implicated in various diseases including cancers, and thus miRNAs have become the valuable biomarkers for disease monitoring. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas) system has shown great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation bio&#8208;sensors because of its precise localization capability, good fidelity, and high cleavage activity. Herein, we review recent advance in development of CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based biosensors for miRNA detection. We summarize the principles, features, and performance of these miRNA biosensors, and further highlight the remaining challenges and future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct observation of charge, energy and H transfer between backbone and nucleobases in isolated DNA oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding how charge and energy as well as protons and hydrogen atoms are transferred in molecular systems as a result of an electronic excitation is fundamental for understanding the interaction between ionizing radiation and biological matter on the molecular level. In order to localize the excitation at the atomic scale, we have chosen to target phosphorus atoms in the backbone of gas&#8208;phase oligonucleotide anions and cations, by means of resonant photoabsorption at the L&#8208; and K&#8208;edges. The ionic photoproducts of the excitation process were studied by a combination of mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The combination of absorption site selectivity and photoproduct sensitivity allowed the identification of X&#8208;ray spectral signatures of specific processes. Moreover, charge and/or energy as well as H transfer from the backbone to nucleobases has been directly observed. While the probability of one vs. two H transfer following valence ionization depends on the nucleobase, ionization of sugar or phosphate groups at the carbon K&#8208;edge or the phosphorus L&#8208;edge mainly leads to single H transfer to protonated adenine. Moreover, our results indicate a surprising proton transfer process to specifically form protonated guanine after excitation or ionization of P 2p electrons.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Functionalization of Mono&#8208; and Polyfluoroepoxides via Fluoroalkylation of Carbonyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We outline a new synthetic method to prepare mono&#8208; and poly&#8208;fluoroepoxides from a diverse pool of electrophiles (ketones, acyl chlorides, esters) and fluoroalkyl anion equivalents. The initially formed &#945;&#8208;fluoro alkoxides undergo subsequent intramolecular ring closure when heated. We demonstrated the versatility of the method through the isolation of 16 mono&#8208; and poly&#8208; fluoroepoxide products. These compounds provide unique entry points for further diversification via either fluoride migration coupled with ring opening, or defluorinative functionalization reactions, the latter of which can be used as a late&#8208;stage method to install select bioactive moieties. The reaction sequences described herein provide a pathway to functionalize the commonly observed products formed from 1,2&#8208;addition into carbonyl electrophiles</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented family of three&#8208; and five&#8208;membered substituted anionic derivatives of parent pnictogenylboranes is herein reported.

Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds 3, 7 and 9' (similar compound to 9, stabilized however by 18&#8209;crown&#8208;6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H2E'&#8209;BH2&#8209;NMe3 leading to corresponding five&#8208;membered chain&#8208;like compounds [Na(18&#8209;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8209;BH2&#8208;R1R2P&#8208;BH2&#8208;E'H2] (E = E' = P, R1 = H, R2 = tBu (13); E = E' = P, R1 = R2 = Ph (14); E = E' = As, R1 = R2 = Ph (15); E = P, E' = As, R1 = R2 = Ph (16)).

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Borylated Arylisoquinoline Complexes in Solution and in cellulo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C&#8208;chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF&#8208;7 cells. Their excited&#8208;state properties are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light&#8208;driven excited&#8208;state dynamics of both complexes in cellulo, i.e., after being taken up into human MCF&#8208;7 cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state is significantly shorter when studied in cellulo (360 &#177; 170 ps) as compared to in DMSO (~ 960 ps) at 600 nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes in cellulo. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra&#8208; and intermolecular effects governing the light&#8208;induced reaction processes in functional dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohols as efficient intermolecular initiators for a highly stereoselective polyene cyclisation cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of benzylic and allylic alcohols in HFIP solvent together with Ti(OiPr)4 has been shown to trigger a highly stereoselective polyene cyclization cascade. Three new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are made during the process and complete stereocontrol of up to five new stereogenic centers is observed. The reaction is efficient, has high functional group tolerance and is atom&#8211;economic generating water as a stoichiometric by&#8211;product. A new polyene substrate&#8211;class is employed, and subsequent mechanistic studies indicate a stereoconvergent mechanism. The products of this reaction can be used to synthesise steroid&#8211;analogues in a single step</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Covalent Interactions: Nature and Directionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically analyzed the nature and the origin of the directionality of pnictogen (PnB), chalcogen (ChB), and halogen bonds (XB) in archetypal FmZ&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F&#8211; complexes (Z = Pn, Ch, X), using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;M06/QZ4P. Quantitative Kohn&#8208;Sham MO and energy decomposition analyses (EDA) show that all these intermolecular interactions have in common that covalence, that is, HOMO&#8211;LUMO interactions, provide a crucial contribution to the bond energy, besides electrostatic attraction. Strikingly, we find that all these bonds are directional (i.e., F&#8211;Z&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F&#8211; is approximately linear) despite, and not because of, the electrostatic interactions which, in fact, favor bending. This constitutes a breakdown of the s&#8208;hole model. We show how the s&#8208;hole model fails by neglecting both, the essential physics behind the electrostatic interaction and that behind the directionality of electron&#8208;rich intermolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Mechanism of Substrate Oxidation in Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases: Insight from Theoretical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) are copper dependent enzymes that boost the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides through a catalytic, oxidative reaction. However, the exact mechanism and the true nature of the co&#8208;substrate remain controversial. Herein theoretical investigations of the mechanism with substrate are reviewed and advantages and disadvantages of the employed methods are discussed.







Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper enzymes that today comprise a large enzyme superfamily, grouped into the distinct members AA9&#8211;AA17 (with AA12 exempted). The LPMOs have the potential to facilitate the upcycling of biomass waste products by boosting the breakdown of cellulose and other recalcitrant polysaccharides. The cellulose biopolymer is the main component of biomass waste and thus comprises a large, unexploited resource. The LPMOs work through a catalytic, oxidative reaction whose mechanism is still controversial. For instance, the nature of the intermediate performing the oxidative reaction is an open question, and the same holds for the employed co&#8208;substrate. Here we review theoretical investigations addressing these questions. The applied theoretical methods are usually based on quantum mechanics (QM), often combined with molecular mechanics (QM/MM). We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the employed theoretical methods and comment on the interplay between theoretical and experimental results.

A common synthetic intermediate approach has enabled the development of two new series of arylbicarbazolium salts, and the formal synthesis of several other classes simplified. These derivatives are recognized as cognates of the neutral spirobifluorene and anionic borate systems, defining a complementary set of ionic/neutral building blocks for chiral reagents, porous materials, and optoelectrically active polymers.







Abstract
A general synthetic approach to halogenated tetraaryl&#8208;ammonium salts has been developed and illustrated crystallographically. Bromide ammonium salts used as common synthetic intermediates together with Suzuki coupling of these bromides to a family of boronic acids provided a simplified strategy for arylation. Resolution of the C2 subset of spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium derivatives led to the first examples of enantiopure spiro&#8208;bicarbazoliums and the assignment of their absolute configuration by comparison of computational and experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. An ECD comparison with Prelog's spirobifluorenes is provided. The absolute configuration of the meta&#8208;bromide spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium salt was confirmed by anomalous scattering. Cruciform and stellate tetra&#8208;substituted salts provide a test of the limits of the methodology, and their structures suggest them to be candidates for MOF building blocks.

         <title>Red Shift in Optical Excitations on Layered Copper Perovskites under Pressure: Role of the Orthorhombic Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By first principles calculations, the behaviour under pressure of the structure and optical transitions of (C2H5NH3)CdCl4:Cu2+ layered system versus two Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) systems, CdCl2:Cu2+ and NaCl:Cu2+ is explored. The last two systems come from a parent phase where CuCl64&#8722; complexes have orbital degeneracy and thus suffer a JT instability. In contrast, there is no degeneracy in the parent phase of the layered system, which undergoes an orthorhombic instability connected with the red shift under pressure.







Abstract
The red shift under pressure in optical transitions of layered compounds with CuCl64&#8722; units is explored through first&#8208;principles calculations and the analysis of available experimental data. The results on Cu2+&#8208;doped (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4, that is taken as a guide, show the existence of a highly anisotropic response to pressure related to a structural instability, driven by a negative force constant, that leads to an orthorhombic geometry of CuCl64&#8722; units but with a hole displaying a dominant 3z2&#8208;r2 character (z being the direction perpendicular to the layer plane). As a result of such an instability, a pressure of only 3&#8197;GPa reduces by 0.21&#8197;&#197; the longest Cu2+&#8208;Cl&#8722; distance, lying in the layer plane, while leaving unmodified the two other metal&#8208;ligand distances. Owing to this fact, it is shown that the lowest d&#8208;d transition would experience a red shift of 0.34&#8197;eV while the first allowed charge transfer transition is also found to be red shifted but only by 0.11&#8197;eV that reasonably concurs with the experimental value. The parallel study on Jahn&#8208;Teller systems CdCl2:Cu2+ and NaCl:Cu2+ involving tetragonal elongated CuCl64&#8722; units shows that the reduction of the long axis by a pressure of 3&#8197;GPa is three times smaller than that for the layered (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4:Cu2+ compound. Accordingly, the optical transitions of such systems, which involve a positive force constant, are much less sensitive to pressure than in layered compounds. The origin of the red shift under pressure undergone by the lowest d&#8208;d and charge transfer transitions of (C2H5NH3)2CdCl4:Cu2+ is discussed in detail.

         <title>Effective Formation of New C(sp2)&#8722;S Bonds via Photoactivation of Alkylamine&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach for the direct thiolation of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes involving visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing EDA complexes is reported. The reaction takes place from an EDA complex between an alkylamine and the heteroarene halide. Selective photolysis to the EDA complex has allowed to generate the heteroarene radical that is suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives, providing a potent synthetic versatility.







Abstract
A novel visible light promoted formation of CAryl&#8208;S bonds through electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes of alkylamines with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)arene halides is presented. This represents the first EDA&#8208;based thiolation method not relying on &#960;&#8208;&#960; or a thiolate&#8208;anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and provides a facile access to heteroarene radicals, which can be suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives to form the corresponding versatile arylsulfides. Mechanistic investigations on the aspects of the whole process were conducted by spectroscopic measurements, demonstrating the hypothesized EDA complex formation. Moreover, the strength of this method has been proven by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of thiolated products and the late&#8208;stage derivatization of an anticoagulant drug.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple sugars like glyceraldehyde readily form ketoses in plausible prebiotic reactions. These ketoses isomerize to form aldoses. It is shown here that fructose, a ketose, spontaneously isomerizes and forms ribosides with barbituric acid, a noncanonical nucleobase. Also, a one&#8208;pot reaction is demonstrated whereby glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid form glucosides via fructose.A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors (Hud et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
The prebiotic origins of ribose, nucleosides, and eventually RNA are enduring questions whose answers are central to the RNA world hypothesis. The abiotic synthesis of sugars was first demonstrated over a century ago, but no known prebiotic reaction produces ribose (an aldose sugar) selectively and in good yield. In contrast, ribulose, and fructose (ketose sugars) and other monosaccharides are formed in high yield by several robust abiotic reactions. It is reported here that ketose sugars &#8208; both ketopentoses and ketohexoes &#8208; serve as precursors for the formation of ribosides and other aldosides, as demonstrated by glycoside&#8208;forming reactions involving barbituric acid, a plausibly prebiotic nucleobase. Moreover, a one&#8208;pot reaction of glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid was discovered which under mild conditions, and without special minerals or other catalysts, results in the formation of glycosides. These results reveal that an exclusive or high&#8208;yielding generation of free ribose was not required for its incorporation into processes that provided the foundations for life.

         <title>In situ Self&#8208;Catalyzed Growth of Manganese&#8208;Embedded 3D Flakes&#8208;Coated Carbon Rod as an Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Reaction Catalyst of Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Coated flakes: Mn&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;aligned 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods are self&#8208;grown catalyzed by Mn. The obtained catalysts exhibit high oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media.







Abstract
The in situ self&#8208;catalyzed growth of manganese&#8208;embedded 3D flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods (GFC) as an efficient oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst of Zinc&#8208;air batteries is described for the first time. By optimizing the amount of Mn in the precursor, a series of 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods were synthesized. GFC with a doping amount of Mn of 10&#8201;% (GFC&#8208;10) exhibits excellent ORR performance with an onset potential of 0.94&#8197;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The Zinc&#8208;air battery is constructed with GFC&#8208;10 as the cathode catalyst, and it exhibits a peak power density of 128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cycling stability of 75&#8197;h at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are superior to the commercial 20&#8197;wt% Pt/C&#8208;based Zinc&#8208;air battery.

     alt="In situ Self-Catalyzed Growth of Manganese-Embedded 3D Flakes-Coated Carbon Rod as an Efficient Oxygen-Reduction Reaction Catalyst of Zinc-Air Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coated flakes&lt;/b&gt;: Mn-coordinated N-aligned 3D graphene-like flakes-coated carbon rods are self-grown catalyzed by Mn. The obtained catalysts exhibit high oxygen-reduction reaction electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in situ self-catalyzed growth of manganese-embedded 3D flakes-coated carbon rods (GFC) as an efficient oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst of Zinc-air batteries is described for the first time. By optimizing the amount of Mn in the precursor, a series of 3D graphene-like flakes-coated carbon rods were synthesized. GFC with a doping amount of Mn of 10&#8201;% (GFC-10) exhibits excellent ORR performance with an onset potential of 0.94&#8197;V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The Zinc-air battery is constructed with GFC-10 as the cathode catalyst, and it exhibits a peak power density of 128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a cycling stability of 75&#8197;h at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which are superior to the commercial 20&#8197;wt% Pt/C-based Zinc-air battery. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn facilitates the self-catalyzed growth of carbon rods, and the change of Mn amount can effectively regulate the morphology of materials. The improved ORR performance of the catalyst is ascribed to the synergistic effect of unique hierarchical porous structure, high-charge transport capacity, abundant carbon defects/edges and Mn-N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; sites. This research provides a new avenue to fabricating highly active Mn-based electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Mechanism of H/D Exchange for Isobutane on H&#8208;BEA by Loading Zn Species in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loading of zinc species in the form of either cations or oxide clusters into zeolite H&#8208;BEA provide the tuning effect on the H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;d10 and Br&#248;nsted acid sites of the zeolite resulting in the change of the indirect reaction mechanism via olefin intermediate to the mechanism of the direct exchange with the assistance of Zn species.







Abstract
Kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated isobutane&#8208;d10 and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of three zeolite samples (H&#8208;BEA, ZnO/H&#8208;BEA, Zn2+/H&#8208;BEA) were monitored with 1H MAS NMR in&#8197;situ at 343&#8211;468&#8197;K. The regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups detected on H&#8208;BEA can be rationalized in terms of the mechanism of indirect exchange, which involves protonation of the intermediate olefin and further hydride abstraction from the other alkane molecule by the formed carbenium ion. Loading of Zn species in the zeolite results in a decrease of the rate and an increase of the activation energy of the exchange. The loaded Zn species provide the tuning effect on the reaction occurrence, changing the mechanism from the indirect one to the mechanism of the direct exchange.

         <title>Synthesis of an Antimicrobial Enterobactin&#8208;Muraymycin Conjugate for Improved Activity Against Gram&#8208;Negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a thiol&#8208;containing muraymycin analogue and its use in an antimicrobial muraymycin&#8208;enterobactin conjugate with an intracellularly cleavable disulfide linker is reported. This conjugation approach was shown to increase antimicrobial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain.







Abstract
Overcoming increasing antibiotic resistance requires the development of novel antibacterial agents that address new targets in bacterial cells. Naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics (such as muraymycins) inhibit the bacterial membrane protein MraY, a clinically unexploited essential enzyme in peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis. Even though a range of synthetic muraymycin analogues has already been reported, they generally suffer from limited cellular uptake and a lack of activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We herein report an approach to overcome these hurdles: a synthetic muraymycin analogue has been conjugated to a siderophore, i.&#8201;e. the enterobactin derivative EntKL, to increase the cellular uptake into Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The resultant conjugate showed significantly improved antibacterial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain, thus providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of this novel approach and a starting point for the future optimisation of such conjugates towards potent agents against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

The synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (B2N2&#8208;DBCs) based on one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation and successive cross&#8208;coupling reaction is reported. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6&#8201;% and long operational lifetime of 907&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of a new class of hetero&#8208;buckybowl, BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (B2N2&#8208;DBCs). The synthesis is achieved via one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation, comprising the nitrogen&#8208;directed haloboration of alkyne and an intramolecular bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, which provides BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulene possessing two bromo substituents (B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;Br). B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;Br undergoes diversification via coupling reactions to provide a variety of arylated derivatives (B2N2&#8208;DBC&#8208;R), exhibiting strong blue fluorescence. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6&#8201;% and long operational lifetime of 907&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, indicating the significant potential for the development of efficient and stable hetero&#8208;buckybowl&#8208;based OLED materials.

A convenient, efficient and direct approach toward structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives has been developed. By simply doping the 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines into benzophenone (BP), a series of RTP systems with tunable lifetime luminescence can be realized. 4&#8201;r/BP nanoparticles could be used for in&#8208;vivo imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted great attention for their wide applications in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. However, the development of these materials remains a challenging task, partially due to the lack of rational molecular design strategies and unclear luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we present a method for facile access to structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives through a copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component coupling reaction that provides a promising approach to rapidly assemble a library of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines for exploring the regularity of the host&#8208;guest doped system. A series of host&#8208;guest RTP materials with wide&#8208;ranging lifetimes from 4.4 to 299.3&#8197;ms were constructed by doping various substituted isoquinolines derivatives into benzophenone (BP). Furthermore, 4&#8201;r/BP nanoparticles could be used for in&#8208;vivo imaging with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio value as high as 32, revealing the potential of the isoquinoline framework for the construction of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.

         <title>Confused&#8208;Prism[5]arene: a Conformationally Adaptive Host by Stereoselective Opening of the 1,4&#8208;Bridged Naphthalene Flap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All change, all together: The confused&#8208;prism[5]arene host changes its planar chirality upon the complexation of ammonium guests, adopting the homochiral all&#8208;pR (or all&#8208;pS) conformation. Stereoselective directional threading was also observed in the presence of directional ammonium axles, resulting in the formation of pseudorotaxanes in which the prismarene wheel adopts homochiral all&#8208;pR (all&#8208;pS) conformation.







Abstract
The confused&#8208;prism[5]arene macrocycle (c&#8208;PrS[5]Me) shows conformational adaptive behavior in the presence of ammonium guests. Upon guest inclusion, the 1,4&#8208;bridged naphthalene flap reverses its planar chirality from pS to pR (with reference to the pS(pR)4 enantiomer). Stereoselective directional threading is also observed in the presence of directional axles, in which up/down stereoisomers of homochiral (pR)5&#8208;c&#8208;PrS[5]Me pseudorotaxanes are formed.

         <title>Electrostatic CH&#8722;&#960; Interactions Can Override Fluorine Gauche Effects To Exert Conformational Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Are the fluorine gauche effects in fluoroethyl systems controlled electrostatically or by hyperconjugation? This experimental study shows that electrostatic forces from CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions (between polar CH2F protons and an adjacent aromatic ring) can override an inherent fluorine gauche effect to exert conformational control over fluoroethyl systems.







Abstract
Fluorine gauche effects are conformational properties of 2&#8208;fluoroethanes often applied in modern molecular designs. However, the physical origins of fluorine gauche effects are not well understood, with the consensus favoring the established hyperconjugation theory over an emerging electrostatic model. Using a series of model systems, we show that a shift to fluorine gauche effects can be influenced by intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; aromatic interactions, a through&#8208;space event. Modulating the &#960;&#8208;ring (forming the aromatic interaction) with substituent groups resulted in a linear Hammett relationship, thus indicating that the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction has electrostatic features. For instance, attaching a nitro group (an electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent) to the &#960;&#8208;ring weakened the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction and led to a gauche preference, whereas an anti conformer is preferred with amine as substituent. The experimental results performed by using proton NMR spectroscopy are corroborated by gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations and solid&#8208;state X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Driven Programmable Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting in Metal&#8208;Organic Cages and Structural Transformations between Heterochiral and Homochiral Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable selectivity in chiral self&#8208;sorting is achieved in the formation of Pd2L4 cages. Anions encapsulation dictates the outcome of diastereomer selectivity, either meso&#8208;cage or racemic mixture of homochiral cages, through chiral social or narcissistic self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Bulky non&#8208;encapsulating anion resulted in no selective chiral self&#8208;sorting. Post&#8208;synthetic anion&#8208;exchange facilitates interconversion between the diastereomers in a desired manner.







Abstract
When a racemic mixture of chiral building blocks self&#8208;assembles to form discrete molecular or supramolecular cages, the system can adopt either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. However, control over such chiral self&#8208;sorting is hard to achieve with a desired choice of outcome. Herein, we report anion templated high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting during the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of [Pd2L4] metal&#8208;organic cages, with a racemic mixture of an axially chiral ligand. Upon varying the counter&#8208;anions, the outcome of the choice of chiral self&#8208;sorting, whether social or narcissistic, leading to kinetically favored heterochiral or thermodynamically favored homochiral cages, can be controlled through specific anion encapsulation. Non&#8208;encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.

         <title>Tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene: A Near&#8208;IR Fluorophore with Four&#8208;Stage Amphoteric Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the red&#8208;light area. A reliable synthesis of a new tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene derivative decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl moieties has been established. The soluble compound features strongly bathochromically shifted absorption and emission bands reaching into the near&#8208;IR region and is prone to four facilitated redox steps. The experimental results, corroborated by theoretical studies, identified the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic scaffold as a particularly promising candidate for the development of redox&#8208;active near&#8208;IR fluorophores.







Abstract
A novel, benign synthetic strategy towards soluble tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene (TPNA) decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl substituents has been established. The compound is perfectly stable under ambient conditions in air and features intense and strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands reaching to near&#8208;IR region beyond 900&#8197;nm. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed four facilitated reversible redox events comprising two oxidations and two reductions. These remarkable experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical studies to identify the TPNA platform a particularly useful candidate for the development of functional near&#8208;IR fluorophores upon appropriate functionalization.

         <title>Recent Status and Developments of Vacancies Modulation in the ABO3 Perovskites for Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of ABO3 with different sites vacancies could optimize its physical&#8211;chemical properties, thereby enhancing its performance at catalytic redox reactions, energy storage, gas sensor, photovoltaics, etc, which exhibiting the potential of the commercial applications.







Abstract
Perovskite oxides (ABO3) have attracted comprehensive interest for wide range of functional applications (especially for chemical catalysis) due to their high design flexibility, controllable vacancies sites creation, abundant chemical properties, and stable crystal structure. Herein, the previous research and potential development of ABO3 through adjusting the vacancy at different sites (A&#8208;site, B&#8208;site, and O&#8208;site) to enhance catalytic performance are systematically analyzed and generalized. Briefly, the ABO3 with different vacancies sites prepared by multifarious direct and indirect methods, accompanied with the improved physical&#8208;chemical properties, endow them with distinct and intensified development of catalysis application. In addition, the impressive optimization proved by the vacancies sites adjustment over the ABO3 is studied to continuously facilitate the advance in some common catalysis reactions, further expanding to other optimized functional applications. At last, the constructive suggestions for fine regulation and analysis of vacancies sites over ABO3 are also put forward.

         <title>Hijacking the Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathway of Escherichia coli to Produce Muropeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward access to Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides was developed by a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy based on metabolically engineered E.coli cells.







Abstract
Soluble fragments of peptidoglycan called muropeptides are released from the cell wall of bacteria as part of their metabolism or as a result of biological stresses. These compounds trigger immune responses in mammals and plants. In bacteria, they play a major role in the induction of antibiotic resistance. The development of efficient methods to produce muropeptides is, therefore, desirable both to address their mechanism of action and to design new antibacterial and immunostimulant agents. Herein, we engineered the peptidoglycan recycling pathway of Escherichia coli to produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;muramic acid (GlcNAc&#8208;anhMurNAc), a common precursor of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides. Inactivation of the hexosaminidase nagZ gene allowed the efficient production of this key disaccharide, providing access to Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides through subsequent chemical peptide conjugation. E. coli strains deficient in both NagZ hexosaminidase and amidase activities further enabled the in&#8197;vivo production of Gram&#8208;negative muropeptides containing meso&#8208;diaminopimelic acid, a rarely available amino acid.

         <title>Selective Metal&#8208;ion Complexation of a Biomimetic Calix[6]arene Funnel Cavity Functionalized with Phenol or Quinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The calixarene core allows the introduction of functional groups at remote distance from the metal ion, but in the vicinity of its labile site. Introducing a phenol or quinone moiety in the calix core, in place of anisole, drastically changes not only thermodynamics but also kinetics of metal ion and guest&#8208;ligand binding, while the first coordination sphere is not affected.







Abstract
In the biomimetic context, many studies have evidenced the importance of the 1st and 2nd coordination sphere of a metal ion for controlling its properties. Here, we propose to evaluate a yet poorly explored aspect, which is the nature of the cavity that surrounds the metal labile site. Three calix[6]arene&#8208;based aza&#8208;ligands are compared, that differ only by the nature of cavity walls, anisole, phenol or quinone (LOMe, LOH and LQ). Monitoring ligand exchange of their ZnII complexes evidenced important differences in the metal ion relative affinities for nitriles, halides or carboxylates. It also showed a possible sharp kinetic control on both, metal ion binding and ligand exchange. Hence, this study supports the observations reported on biological systems, highlighting that the substitution of an amino&#8208;acid residue of the enzyme active site, at remote distance of the metal ion, can have strong impacts on metal ion lability, substrate/product exchange or selectivity.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Nanographenes with Excellent Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties: The Synergy of B/N and Azulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy between electron&#8208;deficient B, electron&#8208;rich N, and polar azulene with a proper arrangement endows these butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographenes with strong second&#8208;order NLO responses.







Abstract
Azulene, a simple polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with connected electron donor and acceptor (DA), ignites the hope of designing second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) molecular materials from pure nonpolar carbon nanomaterials. In this work, a butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene (&#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960;) was designed by incorporating azulene between two coronenes. One more electron in a N atom or one electron fewer in a B atom with respect to a C atom can polarize charge distribution in carbon nanomaterials, and further doping of B and N in the designed butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene changes the system from &#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960; to D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A, leading to strong NLO responses. For example, the largest static first hyperpolarizability even reaches 173.89&#215;10&#8722;30&#8197;esu per heavy atom. The synergetic role of B, N and azulene in the nanographene is scrutinized, and such a doping strategy is found to provide an effective means for the design of carbon&#8208;based functional materials. The strong second&#8208;order NLO responses of these butterfly&#8208;shaped carbon&#8208;based nanographenes under external fields, for example, sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation, could inspire future experimental exploration.

         <title>Bimetallic CuSbSe2: A Potential Anode Material for Sodium and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High&#8208;Rate Capability and Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic CuSbSe2 are successfully synthesis and evaluated in sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208; ion batteries. The CuSbSe2 anode exhibits superior rate behavior and cyclic performance. The excellent electrochemical property is attributed to the synergistic effect and the high electric conductivity of the material.







Abstract
Bimetallic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) materials have emerged as attractive anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the high intrinsic electronic conductivity, rich redox sites and unique reaction mechanism. In this work, we report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of a novel bimetallic TMCs material CuSbSe2. The as&#8208;prepared anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 545.6&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 592.6&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for LIBs at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an excellent rate capability of 425.9&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 226.0&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for LIBs without any common&#8208;used surface modification or carbonaceous compositing. In addition, ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveal a combined conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of LIBs and NIBs. Our findings suggest bimetallic CuSbSe2 could be a potential anode material for both SIBs and LIBs.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Bioreducible Polymers For mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioreducible polymeric mRNA carriers are an emerging family of vectors for gene delivery and vaccine development. Several bioreducible systems have been generated through aqueous&#8208;phase ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lipoic acid derivatives, however this methodology limits the incorporation of hydrophobic functionalities into resulting polymers. Herein we synthesize a poly(active ester)disulfide polymer that can undergo facile aminolysis with amine&#8208;containing substrates under stoichiometric control and&#160; mild reaction conditions to yield a library of multifunctional polydisulfide polymers. Functionalized polydisulfide polymer species form stable mRNA&#8208;polymer nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of mRNAs in vitro . Alkyl&#8208;functionalized polydisulfide&#8208;RNA nanoparticles demonstrate rapid cellular uptake and excellent biodegradability when delivering EGFP and OVA mRNAs to cells in vitro . This streamlined polydisulfide synthesis provides a new facile methodology for accessing multifunctional bioreducible polymers as biomaterials for RNA delivery and other applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tweezer&#8208;Based C&#8208;H Oxidation Catalysts Overriding the Intrinsic Reactivity of Aliphatic Ammonium Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H oxygenation of alkyl chains as well as deactivated positions remains a great challenge for chemists. Here, we report the synthesis and application of four new supramolecular tweezer&#8208;based oxidation catalysts. They consist of the well&#8208;explored M(pdp/mcp) oxidation moiety and a molecular tweezer capable of binding ammonium salts. All catalysts display preferential oxidation of the strongly deactivated C3/C4 positions, however to different degrees. Furthermore, the best performing catalyst Fe(pdp)Twe was explored with an expanded substrate scope. It was demonstrated that the deactivated positions C3/C4 are also preferentially oxidized in these cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Ru clusters decorated Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2 hybrid catalyst synergistically promotes NaBH4 hydrolysis and water splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for hydrolysis of metal hydrides and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for substituting conventional fuels for H2 production. Herein, a sheet&#8208;like Ru clusters modified Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2 supported on nickel foam (Ru/Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2@NF) is constructed by electroless deposition, calcination and chemical reduction. The catalyst exhibits an excellent H2 generation activity with a rate of 4989 mL min&#8722;1 [[EQUATION]]  and good reusability, superior to most previously reported catalysts. Besides, Ru/Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2@NF displays a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic capability with a low overpotential of 153.0 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 (50.5 mV at 10mA cm&#8722;2), a small Tafel slope of 40.0 mV dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability (100 h@10 mA cm&#8722;2) in 1.0 M KOH. The excellent catalytic H2 generation capacity benefits from the rapid charge transfer promoted by metallic Co3B, the synergistically catalytic effect between Co3B&#8208;Co(OH)2 and Ru clusters, and the unique composite structure favorable for solute transport and gas emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of the Dark States in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Process of Electron Donor&#8722;Acceptor Dyads: Insights from Optical Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photophysical processes involved in the electron donor&#8722;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of emitters are complicated and controversial. The recent consensus is that at least three states are involved, i.e. the singlet charge transfer state (1CT), the triplet localized excited state (3LE) and the triplet CT state (3CT). It is clear the very often used steady state and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopic methods are unable to present direct evidence for the dark states, i.e. the 3LE and 3CT states, as well as the interconversion of these states. Concerning this aspect, the femtosecond&#8208;nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic methods are in particular interests. Both the emissive state and the dark state can be detected in these spectra, and interconversion of the states involved in TADF process can be also revealed. This review article focuses on the recent development of using the transient absorption spectra to study the photophysics of the TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Maytansinol Functionalization: Towards Useful Probes for Studying Microtubule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maytansinoids represent a successful class of natural and semisynthetic tubulin binders, known for their potent cytotoxic activity. Their wider application as cytotoxins and chemical probes to study tubulin dynamics was set back due to the complexity of natural product chemistry. Here we report the synthesis of long&#8208;chain derivatives and maytansinoid conjugates. We confirmed that bulky substituents do not impact their high activity and the scaffold&#8217;s binding mode. These encouraging results open new avenues for the design of new maytansine&#8208;based probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Relaxation of Pseudotetrahedral [N2O2] Bis&#8208;Chelate Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets Controlled by Dihedral Twist Through Solvomorphism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methanol solvomorph 1&#183;2MeOH of the cobalt(II) complex [Co(LSal,2&#8208;Ph)2] (1) with the sterically demanding Schiff&#8208;base ligand 2&#8208;(([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;ylimino)methyl)phenol (HLSal,2&#8208;Ph) shows the thus far largest dihedral twist distortion between the two chelate planes compared to an ideal pseudotetrahedral arrangement. The cobalt(II) ion in 1&#183;2MeOH exhibits an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy leading to a spinreversal barrier of 55.3 cm&#8211;1, which corresponds to an increase of about 17% induced by the larger dihedral twist compared to the solvent&#8208;free complex 1. The magnetic relaxation for 1&#183;2MeOH is significantly slower compared to 1. An in&#8208;depth frequency&#8208;domain Fouriertransform (FD&#8208;FT) THz&#8208;EPR study not only allowed the direct measurement of the magnetic transition between the two lowest Kramers doublets for the cobalt(II) complexes, but also revealed the presence of spin&#8208;phonon coupling. Interestingly, a similar dihedral twist correlation is also observed for a second pair of cobalt(II)&#8208;based solvomorphs, which could be benchmarked by FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Insights into Bifunctional Ambruticin DH3 for Substrate Specificity and Catalytic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydratase (DH), a domain located at polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, commonly catalyzes the dehydration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl intermediate. As a unique bifunctional dehydratase, AmbDH3 (the DH domain of module 3 of the ambruticin PKS) is verified to be responsible for both dehydration and the following pyran&#8208;forming cyclization. Besides, in vitro studies showed that its catalytic efficiency varies with different chiral substrates. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AmbDH3 remains unclear. In this work, the structural rationale for the substrate specificity (2R/2S&#8208; and 6R/6S&#8208;substrates) in AmbDH3 was elucidated and the complete reaction pathways including dehydration and cyclization were presented. Both MD simulations and binding free energy calculations indicated AmbDH3 had a stronger preference for 2R&#8208;substrates (2R6R&#8208;2, 2R6S&#8208;3) than 2S&#8208;substrates (2S6R&#8208;1), and residue H51 and G61 around the catalytic pocket were emphasized by forming stable hydrogen bonds with 2R&#8208;substrates. In addition, AmbDH3&#8217;s mild tolerance at C6 was explained by comparison of substrate conformation and hydrogen bond network in 6S&#8208; and 6R&#8208;substrate systems. The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one&#8208;base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for 2R6S&#8208;3 substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2 kcal mol&#8208;1 and 24.5 kcal mol&#8208;1, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran&#8208;containing products.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dehydratase (DH), a domain located at polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, commonly catalyzes the dehydration of &#946;-hydroxy to an &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated acyl intermediate. As a unique bifunctional dehydratase, AmbDH3 (the DH domain of module 3 of the ambruticin PKS) is verified to be responsible for both dehydration and the following pyran-forming cyclization. Besides, in vitro studies showed that its catalytic efficiency varies with different chiral substrates. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AmbDH3 remains unclear. In this work, the structural rationale for the substrate specificity (2R/2S- and 6R/6S-substrates) in AmbDH3 was elucidated and the complete reaction pathways including dehydration and cyclization were presented. Both MD simulations and binding free energy calculations indicated AmbDH3 had a stronger preference for 2R-substrates (2R6R-2, 2R6S-3) than 2S-substrates (2S6R-1), and residue H51 and G61 around the catalytic pocket were emphasized by forming stable hydrogen bonds with 2R-substrates. In addition, AmbDH3&#8217;s mild tolerance at C6 was explained by comparison of substrate conformation and hydrogen bond network in 6S- and 6R-substrate systems. The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one-base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for 2R6S-3 substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2 kcal mol-1 and 24.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase-cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran-containing products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;stage core&#8208;expansion method is proposed here as one component of the integrative binding&#8208;site/extender/core&#8208;expansion (BEC) strategy. The conceptual deconstruction of the partitioning ligand into three editable parts draws our focus onto progressive core expansion and allows the optimization of both acetylene uptake and selectivity. The effectiveness of this strategy is shown through a family of eight cationic pore&#8208;partitioned materials containing three different partitioning ligands and various counter anions. The optimized structure, Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl (Hcpt = 4&#8208;(p&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H&#8208;tph = (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene) with the largest surface area and highest C2H2 uptake capacity (200 cm3/g at 298 K), also exhibits (desirably) the lowest CO2 uptake and hence the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity. The successful boost in both C2H2 capacity and IAST selectivity allows Co3&#8208;cpt&#8208;tph&#8208;Cl to rank among the best crystalline porous materials, ionic MOFs in particular, for C2H2 uptake and C2H2/CO2 experimental breakthrough separation.</dc:description>

Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with pyrrole and subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde, afforded mono&#8208;anionic, &#960;&#8208;extended bipyricorrole&#8208;like macrocycle. Attempted Ni(II) insertion with Ni(OAc)2&#8226;4H2O resulted an ESR active, Ni(II) bipyricorrole radical complex, which is converted to stable cationic Ni(II) complex upon treatment with [(Et3O)+(SbCl6)&#8208;]. Both complexes were characterized by 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Ni(II) bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to cationic Ni(II) complex by single electron reduction using cobaltocene.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Organogelators from Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: Effect of Stereochemistry and their Application on Visual Chiral Recognition of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators based on carboxylic acids derived from chiral cyclic &#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. The effect of their stereochemistry on the gelation of organic solvents was investigated, and their assemblies with the intermolecular interactions in the xerogels were proposed via infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and crystallographic details of the related model compounds. The effect of the alkyl chain length on the gelators was studied, and they were applied to the chiral recognition of amines. Only one diastereomeric salt with amines afforded gels, whereas the others resulted in precipitates. Chiral recognition was also achieved in the gel state, and the appearance of the as&#8208;prepared gel changed upon the addition of each amine enantiomer, thus enabling the visual detection of their chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>ZnTe/rGO composite as the Fully&#8208;Zinced Conversion&#8208;Type Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion&#8208;type cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) can provide flat plateau slop and stable output potential, compared to general intercalation&#8208;type cathodes. The high volumetric capacity and stable output potential of Te make it a promising cathode for ZIBs, but sluggish kinetics and large volume change hinder its further application. To address these issues, we revisit fully&#8208;zinced ZnTe and construct ZnTe/rGO composites as the new conversion&#8208;type cathode. The electrode undergoes a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion reaction and shows a stable output potential with ultra&#8208;flat discharge plateau slop of 0.09 V (Ah g&#8208;1)&#8208;1. When ZnTe is de&#8208;zinced and transformed to Te during charge process, it has a volume shrinkage which generates empty space in graphene matrix for latter volume expansion of Te. The graphene matrix also improves conductivity and reaction kinetics of the cathode. Due to the combination of pre&#8208;zincation of ZnTe, graphene matrix and the elimination of &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; process, ZnTe/rGO electrode exhibits a high and stable capacity of 186 mAh g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1 after 300 cycling, with almost no decay after initial 10 cycles.</dc:description>

Due to the combination of pre-zincation of ZnTe, graphene matrix and the elimination of &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; process, ZnTe/rGO electrode exhibits a high and stable capacity of 186 mAh g-1 at 500 mA g-1 after 300 cycling, with almost no decay after initial 10 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isocyanide&#8208;based Multicomponent Reactions Promoted by Visible Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions claim a one century&#8208;old history of flourishing developments. On the other hand, the enormous impact of recent progresses in visible light photocatalysis has boosted the identification of new straightforward and green approaches to both new and known chemical entities. In this context, the application of visible light photocatalytic conditions to multicomponent processes has been promoting key stimulating advancements. Spanning from radical&#8208;polar crossover pathways, to photoinduced and self&#8208;catalyzed transformations, to reactions involving the generation of imidoyl radical species, the present literature analysis would provide a general and critical overview about the potentialities and challenges of exploiting isocyanides in visible light photocatalytic multicomponent reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrelanes versus Tetrylenes as Precursors to Transition Metal Complexes Featuring Tridentate PEP Tetryl Ligands (E = Si, Ge, Sn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two synthetic approaches have until now been used to synthesize transition metal complexes having a tridentate (pincer or tripod) PEP tetryl (E = Si, Ge, Sn) ligand. These approaches differ in the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the corresponding PEP tetryl ligand. Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane&#8208;free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8211;X bond (X = H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low&#8208;valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8211;X bond (X = Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures and Supramolecular Properties of Inclusion Complexes of Anthracene&#8211;Triptycene Nanocages with Fullerene Guests and Their Dynamic Motion as Molecular Gyroscopes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three derivatives of macrocyclic cage compounds consisting of diarylanthracene and triptycene units were synthesized. These nanocages formed host&#8211;guest complexes with C60 and other fullerene guests as confirmed by 1H NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. The association constant of the mesityl and 2,4,6&#8208;tributoxyphenyl derivatives with C60 was determined to be 2.2 &#215; 104 L mol&#8211;1, which was larger than that of the pentafluorophenyl derivative. We obtained direct experimental evidence of the complexation by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis: the guest C60 molecule was included in the cavity via multipoint CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Dynamic disorders of the included C60 molecule in variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray analysis indicated uniaxial motion, such as gyroscopic motion. The unique dynamic behavior of the spherical C60 rotor anchored by the cage stator via CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions in the crystal, as well as substituent effects on the association properties, will be discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>POM@ZIF Derived Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts for Sustained Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials is crucial for energy conversion and storage. In this work, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 can be converted into a stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst by chemical etching, cation exchange, and thermal annealing steps. Characterization using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicate that POM&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 derived carbon supported metal oxides were synthesized. The resulting composite shows structural and compositional advantages which lead to low overpotential (306 mV at j = 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2) and long&#8208;term stability under harsh OER conditions (1.0 M aqueous KOH).</dc:description>

         <title>N2&#8208;Reduction vs H2&#8208;Evolution in a Molybdenum&#8208; or Tungsten&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Model System of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase. In comparison, analogous tungsten complexes have in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein we show that a tungsten complex supported by a pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand, under conditions of N  2  fixation, primarily catalyses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in contrast to its Mo analogue, which catalytically mediates the nitrogen reduction reaction (N  2  RR). DFT calculations are employed to evaluate possible mechanisms and identify the most likely pathways of N  2  RR and HER activities exhibited by Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;pentaPod complexes. Two mechanisms for N  2  RR by PCET are considered, starting from neutral (M(0) cycle) and cationic (M(I) cycle) dinitrogen complexes (M = Mo, W). The latter is found to be energetically more favourable. For HER three scenarios are treated; i.e., through bimolecular reactions of early M&#8208;N  x  H  y  intermediates, pure hydride intermediates or mixed M(H)(N  x  H  y  ) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Assisted Isomerically Pure Oxindole&#8208;Terminated Quinoids for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinoidal compounds have great potential utility as high&#8208;performance organic semiconducting materials because of their rigid planar structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, the existence of E and Z isomers adversely affects the charge&#8208;transport properties of quinoidal compounds. In this study, we developed three isomerically pure oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids by introducing chlorine atoms in the quinoidal core. The synthesized quinoids were confirmed to have a Z,Z configuration by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Importantly, the strategy of chlorination allowed to maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. Consequently, all three quinoidal compounds showed n&#8208;type transport characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors, with electron mobilities up to 0.35 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest value reported to date for oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids. We believe that our study can provide new guidelines for the design of isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobilities.</dc:description>

Various multicomponent COFs bearing both a moiety for photosensitization and complexation of nickel catalysts were synthesized using reticulation with different 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene nodes. This enabled the switching between persistent, charge&#8208;separated species or efficient charge&#8208;carrier mobility for different metallaphotocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions based on the node unit. The frameworks showed recyclability and the possibility to drive the reactions using red light irradiation.







Abstract
The multicomponent approach allows to incorporate several functionalities into a single covalent organic framework (COF) and consequently allows the construction of bifunctional materials for cooperative catalysis. The well&#8208;defined structure of such multicomponent COFs is furthermore ideally suited for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. We report a series of multicomponent COFs that contain acridine&#8208; and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable the usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8722;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto&#8208;enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge&#8208;separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel&#8208;loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross&#8208;couplings even using red light irradiation.

         <title>Boosting Ring Strain and Lewis Acidity of Borirane: Synthesis, Reactivity and Density Functional Theory Studies of an Uncoordinated Arylborirane Fused to o&#8208;Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An uncoordinated o&#8208;carborane&#8208;fused arylborirane was synthesized, which not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8722;(C=O)&#8722; into a B&#8722;C bond. The detailed computational mechanism studies show the relevance of both ring strain and Lewis acidity to the unique reaction profiles.







Abstract
Among the parent borirane, benzoborirene and ortho&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;fused borirane, the latter possesses the highest ring strain and the highest Lewis acidity according to our density functional theory (DFT) studies. The synthesis of this class of compounds is thus considerably challenging. The existing examples require either a strong &#960;&#8208;donating group or an extra ligand for B&#8208;coordination, which nevertheless suppresses or completely turns off the Lewis acidity. The title compound, which possesses both features, not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of P=O, C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8722;(C=O)&#8722; into a B&#8722;C bond. The fusion of strained molecular systems to an o&#8208;carborane cage shows great promise for boosting both the ring strain and acidity.

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Thiourea S&#8208;Oxides through Direct Thiourea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulking up: Thiourea S&#8208;oxides are usually short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates in the oxidation of thioureas and can be considered as heavier homologues of the elusive N&#8208;heterocyclic Criegee intermediates. Preparation and isolation was possible by introduction of bulky substituents on the nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Thiourea S&#8208;oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates (urea O&#8208;oxides). However, the preparation of such S&#8208;oxides is rather challenging, and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D4 double hybrid density functional, it was found that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea S&#8208;oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong &#960;&#8208;donation from the thiourea's nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea S&#8208;oxides in isolated yields of 35&#8211;40&#8201;%. The S&#8208;oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl&#8208;substituted thiourea S&#8208;oxide complexed with residual mCBA could be characterized by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino&#8208;substituted C=S+&#8722;O&#8722; moiety.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Atroposelective C&#8722;H Iodination to Synthesize Axial Chiral Biaryl N&#8208;Oxides via Enantioselective Desymmetrization Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
Pd(II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine has been identified as a highly enantioselective catalyst for atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination at room temperature via desymmerization strategy providing nearly enantiopure samples of a diverse range axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides. Mechanistic investigation disclosed the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol.







Abstract
The discovery of enantioselective desymmetrization reactions to provide practical synthesis of enantio&#8208;enriched atropisomeric biaryls is a challenging topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report a highly enantioselective desymmetrization reaction for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides by atroposelective C&#8722;H iodination by using Pd(II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as a chiral catalyst at room temperature. A broad range of products were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The products could be synthesized in gram scale, one of which was proved to be a powerful organocatalyst in asymmetric allylation reaction. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol in this reaction.

         <title>Photoresponsive Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous liquids have typically focused on static components which require temperature and pressure swings, or sonication, to release gas from the system. Here, a new photoresponsive type&#8197;III porous liquid is reported, formed by dispersing a known photoresponsive metal&#8211;organic framework in an ionic liquid, creating a porous liquid capable of releasing gas upon irradiation with UV light.







Abstract
Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free&#8208;flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non&#8208;porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release which involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO2 over CH4 and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Coupled with Organic Conversion to Selectively Synthesize High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical process of coupling electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and organic conversion reaction can effectively reduce the reaction overpotential and obtain value&#8208;added chemicals. Moreover, because of the diversity of substrates and the designability of coupling forms, more and more attention has been paid to this field. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of coupling electrolysis in recent years, (1) co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and organics at the cathode to obtain specific products with high selectivity, (2) replacing traditional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other valuable oxidation reactions to improve energy utilization efficiency and economic benefits of CO2 conversion, (3) in an electrolytic cell without membrane, the cathode and anode jointly transform CO2 and organics to redox products. We hope that the examples and insights on coupling electrolysis introduced in this review can inspire researchers to further explore and innovate in this direction.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Photodynamics of the Fluorescence Emission and Singlet Oxygen Generation of Fluorogen Activating Protein&#8208;Malachite Green&#160;System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembled fluorogen activating protein (FAP)&#8208; malachite green (MG) complex is a well&#8208;established protein&#8208;ligand system, which can realize binding&#8208;caused fluorescence turn&#8208;on of MG and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generation by MG iodination. To clarify the mechanism of fluorescence activation and the 1 O 2 generation, the photodynamics of different halogen&#8208;substituted MG derivatives and their corresponding MG&#8208;FAP complexes were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical computation. The results show that the rotation of MG was restricted by FAP binding, which preventing the rapid internal conversion and allowing a long lifetime for the excited MG to undergo fluorescence emission and intersystem crossing. Moreover, these MG&#8208;FAP complexes exhibit obviously varied fluorescence quantum yields ( &#934; FL ) and 1 O 2 yields. The study on the decay pathways indicates that such an anti&#8208;heavy atom effect predominately stems from the lifetimes of the excited&#8208;state species. The photodynamic mechanism study here will lead to more advanced FAP&#8208;MG systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Green emissive copper nanocluster with aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission for selective detection of Al3+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective detection of Al3+ is of great significance both for the benefit of human health and environmental safety considerations. In this work, a sensitive and selective fluorescence assay for Al3+ was proposed based on the green emissive Cu nanoclusters (Cu NCs). Different from the commonly reported works, the green emissive Cu NCs showed dual emission bands at 450 and 510 nm, attributed to the reaction product between polyvinyl pyrrolidone and ascorbic acid and the Cu core, respectively. Al3+ could induce the aggregation of Cu NCs by forming covalent bonds, which results in the enhancement of photoluminescence intensity. This enhancement phenomenon is rather selective to Al3+, which endows the detection in real samples. These results provide new insights for the fluorescence mechanisms of metal NCs, which also provided a functional luminescent material for various applications, such as chemical sensing, bioimaging and photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Hydrolysis of Phosphate Esters: A Route to Calixarene&#8208;Supported Rare&#8208;Earth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate ester bonds are widely present in nature (e.g. DNA/RNA) and can be extremely stable against hydrolysis without the help of catalysts. Previously, we showed how the combination of phosphoryl and calix[4]arene moieties in the same organic framework (LPO) allows isolation of single lanthanide (Ln) metal ions as [LnIII(LPO)2](O3SCF3)3. Here we report how by controlling the reaction conditions a new hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO) is formed as a result of LnIII&#8208;mediated P&#8211;OEt bond cleavage in three out of the eight possible sites in LPO. The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 dimers (Ln = La, Dy, Tb, Gd), where the Dy derivative shows slow magnetization relaxation. The strategy presented herein could be extended to access a broader library of hydrolyzed platforms (H x LHPO; x = 1&#8211;8) that may represent mimics of nuclease enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Interrupted Domino Reaction for the Synthesis of Fused Triazolyl Benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed domino reactions of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes yield fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides. The protocol features the synthesis of two fused heterocyclic rings in one step with good to excellent yields and a broad functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations indicate that a copper &#960;&#8208;complex initiates a cycloaddition and oxidative C&#8211;N coupling reaction sequence. The results suggest an interrupted domino process involving an iodinated triazole as a key intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites as a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalyst for organic dye removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites with Co3O4 as the core, Fe3O4/C as the shell, and a cavity structure were synthesized by the hard template method. The physical and chemical properties of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, XPS, BET, and VSM. The specific surface area of yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites is 175.9 m2 g&#8208;1, showing superparamagnetic properties. The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites were used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade MB, which showed high catalytic degradation performance. The degradation rate of MB reached 100% within 30 min under the circumstances of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1 g L&#8208;1, the PMS dosage of 1.0 g L&#8208;1, the initial MB concentration of 100 mg L&#8208;1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30&#177;2 &#8451;. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co&#8208;existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO&#8324;&#775;&#8315;&#160;in the&#160;yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification.</dc:description>

The degradation rate of MB reached 100% within 30 min under the circumstances of the yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1 g L-1, the PMS dosage of 1.0 g L-1, the initial MB concentration of 100 mg L-1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30&#177;2 &#8451;. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co-existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO&#8324;&#775;&#8315;&#160;in the&#160;yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk-shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Thiyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Desilylation of Arylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward, visible&#8208;light triggered desilylation of arylsilanes by thiyl radicals is presented. Silyl groups are often used to block a reactive position in multi&#8208;step organic synthesis, for which a mild cleavage at a late&#8208;stage will provide new possibilities and disconnection routes by CAr&#8208;Si cleavage/deprotection. In this work, commercially available and cheap disulfides are employed for the first time in this type of C(sp2)&#8208;Si bond cleavage reactions. Thus, upon irradiation with visible&#8208;light, homolytic cleavage of the disulfide give rise to the corresponding thiyl radical that allows for a radical chain mechanism. This methodology represents a mild, fast and simple approach suitable for a broad variety of simply substituted arylsilanes. Moreover, the procedure could be easily extended to natural products and therapeutic derivatives, showing its robustness and synthetic application potential.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Small molecule&#8208;drug conjugates (SMDCs) mimicking the RGD sequence (&#8208;Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;) with a non&#8208;peptide moiety require a pharmacophore&#8208;independent attachment site. A library of 36 sulfonamide&#8208;modified RGD mimetics with nM to pM affinity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3 was synthesized and analysed via DAD mapping. The best structure of the conjugable RGD mimetic was used and a linker was attached to an aromatic ring by Negishi cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>A Modular Olefination of Aldehydes with Thiols as Coupling Partners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefins range amongst the most important motifs in organic chemistry. Hence, the development of novel olefin syntheses has remained a constant field of research in synthetic chemistry to date. Herein, we report the development of a modular olefination that converts aldehydes into olefins with thiols as reaction partners. The simple, transition metal&#8208;free protocol proceeds via an unsymmetrical bissulfone intermediate which is converted into the respective alkene in a Ramberg&#8208;B&#228;cklund&#8208;type process. Differently substituted olefins can be synthesized from readily available starting materials in typically good yields and stereoselectivites using basic laboratory chemicals exclusively. Complementary reaction conditions differing in the choice of solvent favor the E/Z&#8208;products respectively under kinetic control rendering this protocol an interesting economical addition to the family of olefin syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular rotational correlation times and nanoviscosity determined by 111mCd perturbed angular correlation (PAC) of &#947;&#8208;rays spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoviscosity experienced by molecules in solution may be determined through measurement of the molecular rotational correlation time, &#964;c. e.g. by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. With this work we apply PAC spectroscopy to determine the rate of rotational diffusion, &#955;=1/&#964;c, of a de novo designed protein, TRIL12AL16C, in solutions with viscosities, &#958;, from 1.7 to 88 mPa&#183;s. TRIL12AL16C was selected as molecular probe, because it exhibits minimal effects of intramolecular dynamics and static line broadening, allowing for exclusive elucidation of molecular rotation diffusion. &#955; determined by PAC spectroscopy agrees well with literature data from fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, and scales linearly with 1/&#958; in agreement with the Stokes&#8208;Einstein&#8208;Debye model. PAC experiments require only trace amounts (&#8275;1011) of probe nuclei and can be conducted over a broad range of sample temperatures and pressures. Moreover, most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays. Thus, PAC spectroscopy may find applications under circumstances where conventional techniques cannot be applied, spanning from physics of liquids to in vivo biochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;derived NiCo&#8208;LDH nanocages on CuO nanorod arrays for robust and high energy density asymmetric supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process. Unfortunately, solitary LDH still has great limitations as electrode material due to the shortcomings such as poor conductivity and easy agglomeration. Herein, nanoflakes assembled NiCo&#8208;LDH hollow nanocages derived from metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) precursor are strung by CuO nanorods formed from etching and oxidation of copper foam (CF), forming hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructures. The as&#8208;synthesized CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF shows large capacitance (5607 mF cm&#8208;2 at 1 mA cm&#8208;2), superior rate performance (88.3% retention at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and impressive cycling durability (93.1% capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles), which is significant superior to control CuO/CF, CuO@ZIF&#8208;67/CF, NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and Cu(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF electrodes. Besides, an asymmetrical supercapacitor consists of CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and activated carbon displays maximum energy density of 47.3 Wh kg&#8208;1, and its capacitance only declines by 6.8% after 10000 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling durability. The advantages of highly conductive and robust CuO nanorods, MOF&#8208;derived hollow structure and the core&#8208;shell heterostructure contribute to the outstanding electrochemical performance. This synthesis strategy can be extended to design of various core&#8208;shell heterostructures adopted in versatile electrochemical energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready to screen. A library of cationic bis(acylhydrazones) as putative G4&#8208;DNA ligands was prepared by a straightforward condensation of the corresponding building blocks. Screening the resulting samples (without any isolation or purification steps) by fluorescence&#8208;melting experiments identified three novel hits, whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNA targets were studied in detail by several biophysical methods and molecular modeling.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine&#8208;rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high&#8208;throughput methods that allow the generation of congeneric series of G4&#8208;targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigating their interactions with the targets. We have developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well&#8208;established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables the rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interactions with G4&#8208;DNAs of different topologies were studied in detail by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.

     alt="Optimization of G-Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ready to screen&lt;/b&gt;. A library of cationic bis(acylhydrazones) as putative G4-DNA ligands was prepared by a straightforward condensation of the corresponding building blocks. Screening the resulting samples (without any isolation or purification steps) by fluorescence-melting experiments identified three novel hits, whose interactions with G4-DNA targets were studied in detail by several biophysical methods and molecular modeling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high-throughput methods that allow the generation of congeneric series of G4-targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigating their interactions with the targets. We have developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready-to-screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well-established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables the rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interactions with G4-DNAs of different topologies were studied in detail by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aluminium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8722;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CBG aluminium&#8208;dihydride (I) is used as a catalyst for reducing esters with good tolerance of reducible functionalities. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that compound I catalyzed the hydroboration of epoxides into Markovnikov&#8208;branched products. The earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive Al&#8208;based catalysts are attractive and alternatives to expensive transition and lanthanide&#8208;based metal catalysts.







Abstract
In this work, the molecular aluminium dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminium dihydride in the C&#8722;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.

         <title>Hyperbranched Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Polymers Constructed via Linear Side&#8208;Chains towards Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers with high charge mobilities have drawn increasing attention in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) in recent years. However, OFETs of conjugated polymers with high mobility and good device stability remain a challenge. In this article, we report a hyperbranched polymer approach to improve the charge mobility and device stability. Three hyperbranched diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers were designed and synthesized via linear alkyl side&#8208;chain linkers. The results show that 2D topological hyperbranched polymers form stable thin film microstructures, and thus improve the device stability, since the conjugated moiety is interconnected by linear alkyl chain. Besides, the incorporation of linear alkyl chain instead of branching alkyl one reduce steric hindrance, and improve the microstructure ordering as well as the charge mobility. Bar&#8208;coated OFETs result demonstrates that the devices mobilities and operational stabilities (bias stability and bending resistance) are both improved. All these indicate that hyperbranched polymer is a potential candidate for future application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation of allenyl ketones with diboron compounds which involves the carbene boryl migratory insertion as the key step. This reaction features mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Thus, it represents an efficient methodology for the assembly of diverse tri&#8208;substituted furyl boronates. In addition, a series of transformations of the resulting multi&#8208;substituted furyl boronates were conducted to provide various densely substituted furan derivatives in good yields, further illustrating the potential synthetic utility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyanion&#8208;type Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is a promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low cost and high safety. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) holey graphene (HG) decorated NFPP/C material (NFPPCHG) has been successfully prepared by a simple and scalable ball milling strategy with sodium phytate and ferrous oxalate as precursors. The introduction of HG can obviously improve the specific surface area, electronic conductivity and ions transport performance of NFPPCHG, and largely enhance its electrochemical properties. The prepared NFPPCHG delivers a high reversible capacity of 118 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and keeps a considerable capacity of 53 mAh g&#8208;1 even at an ultrahigh rate of 100 C. NFPPCHG also shows excellent performance at 55 &#176;C and &#8208;20 &#176;C. Moreover, in&#8208;situ distribution of relaxation time analysis further demonstrates NFPPCHG has superior electrochemical kinetics. In addition, HC//NFPPCHG full cell displays good performance, suggesting great potential of the prepared material for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fisson of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen&#8208;containing skeletons. Unlike approaches starting from cyclic tertiary amines, methods that can directly open secondary amines are still scarce. The present work discloses an efficient reductive ring opening of either of these cyclic amines using PhSiH3 under B(C6F5)3 catalysis. By this, the direct transformation of unstrained cyclic amines into the corresponding acyclic amines is achieved in a simple one&#8208;pot operation. A stepwise mechanism proceeding through the intermediacy of silylammonium ions followed by reductive cleavage of a carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond was experimentally verified.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Post&#8208;Functionalization and Properties of Diphosphapentaarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortening the core. Diphosphapentaarenes, the shorter analogs of diphosphahexaarenes, are stable linearly fused systems containing two six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles. They are fluorescent and their phosphorus atoms can be readily post&#8208;functionalized to modify their optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Linearly&#8208;fused polyarenes are an important class of compounds with high relevance in materials science. While modifying the shape and size represents a common means to fine&#8208;tune their properties, the precise placement of heteroatoms is a strategy that is receiving an increasing deal of attention to overcome the intrinsic limitations of all&#8208;carbon structures. Thus, linearly&#8208;fused diphosphaarenes recently emerged as a novel family of molecules with striking optoelectronic properties and outstanding stability. However, the properties of diphosphaarenes are far from being benchmarked. Herein, we report the synthesis, phosphorus post&#8208;functionalization and properties of new diphosphapentaarene derivatives. We describe their synthetic limitations and unveil their potential for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Molybdenocenes with Strong Metabolic Effects Inhibit Tumour Growth in Mice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molybdenocenes containing lipophilic substituted Cp ligands as well as bioactive chelating ligands have shown cytotoxicity against lung, colon and ovarian cancer in&#8197;vitro; one complex showed the greatest anticancer activity of any Mo&#8208;based agent known to date. Significant tumour growth inhibition was observed in in&#8197;vivo studies while proteomics showed the most active compound had a strong effect on cellular metabolic processes.







Abstract
A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. In vitro experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts. In vivo experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8722;Cp)2MoCl2 and the in&#8197;vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.

&lt;p&gt;A series of six highly lipophilic Cp-substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. In vitro experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non-Cp-substituted counterparts.
