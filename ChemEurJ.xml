         <title>(NH4)2V7O16 Micro&#8208;bricks as a Novel Anode for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;ion Battery with Good&#160;Cyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li  +  /Na  +  hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems, (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  and (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  , both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. The capacity retention of 78.61% after 500 cycles at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  has been demonstrated in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system while no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells have also been researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that the layered (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cata&#8208;Annulated Azaacene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient azaacenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes with chlorinated mellophanic diimide followed by oxidation of the intermediate N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydro compounds with MnO2 or PbO2. The resulting cata&#8208;annulated bisimide azaacenes have ultrahigh electron affinities with first reduction potentials as low as &#8211;0.35 V recorded for a tetraazapentacene. Attempts to prepare a tetrakis&#173;(dicarboximide)&#173;tetraazaheptacene resulted in the formation of a symmetric butterfly dimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have once been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8211;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu  3+  , La  3+  , and Y  3+  , into polyvalent Ionic Liquids. In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM  3+  ][A  &#8211;  ]  3  . To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants  P  and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes and Alkenes under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go with the flow: The photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using the [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 catalyst under blue LEDs irradiation is reported. A large panel of alkenes and alkynes was functionalized in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, the photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous flow conditions is described. By using 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the developed [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 under blue LEDs irradiation, a large panel of alkenes and alkynes was hydrosilylated in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance. The mechanism of the reaction was studied, and a plausible scenario was suggested.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Channel Optical Device for Solar&#8208;Driven Bacterial Inactivation under Real&#8208;Time Temperature Feedback</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial device was designed with multilayers based on IrO2 nanoaggregates&#8208;based photothermal and temperature sensor channels. The device can efficiently inactivate bacteria by monitoring the temperature accurately during the photothermal process. This study could provide valuable insight for development of solar&#8208;driven and self&#8208;feedback device for photothermal antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial devices have attracted a lot of interest due to the fact that solar energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy in the world. However, conventional materials have a narrow absorbance band, resulting in deficient solar harvesting. In addition, lack of knowledge on temperature change in these devices during the photothermal process has also led to a waste of energy. Here, we presented an elegant multi&#8208;channel optical device with a multilayer structure to simultaneously address the above&#8208;mentioned issues in solar&#8208;driven antibacterial devices. In the photothermal channel, semiconductor IrO2&#8208;nanoaggregates exhibited higher solar absorbance and photothermal conversion efficiency compared with nanoparticles. In the luminescence channel, thermal&#8208;sensitive Er&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles were utilized to reflect the microscale temperature in real&#8208;time. The bacteria were successfully inactivated during the photothermal effect under solar irradiation with temperature monitoring. This study could provide valuable insight for the development of smart photothermal devices for solar&#8208;driven photothermal bacterial inactivation in the future.

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Heterobimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers have been synthesized, which, upon 2e&#8208;oxidation, produce stable dication diradical species as shown. Through the bridge, both porphyrin rings exhibited notable conjugation resulting in effective coupling between metal and porphyrin radical spins of both rings while the coupling model dependent on the nature of metal ion used. Mulliken spin density distributions display the Cu(II) porphyrin center as charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center as charge acceptor.







Abstract
We have described copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared them with the corresponding homobimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct in the heterometallic species while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies show that upon 2e&#8208;oxidation of the heterobimetallic complexes only ring&#8208;centered oxidation occurs. The energy differences between HOMO and LUMO are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band obtained for the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Also, strong electronic communication between two porphyrin rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins present while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. While unpaired spins of Fe(III) and the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled, such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and a porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of dimanganese(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) porphyrin dimers as compared to their diiron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of a &#960;&#8208;cation radical and copper(II) is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) porphyrin dimer as compared to its copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively. In both the 2e&#8208;oxidized heterobimetallic complexes, the Cu(II) porphyrin center acts as a charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center act as a charge acceptor. The experimental observations are also strongly supported by DFT calculations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have described copper(II)-iron(III) and copper(II)-manganese(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared them with the corresponding homobimetallic analogs. UV-visible spectra are very distinct in the heterometallic species while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic and UV-visible spectroscopic studies show that upon 2e-oxidation of the heterobimetallic complexes only ring-centered oxidation occurs. The energy differences between HOMO and LUMO are linearly dependent with the low-energy NIR band obtained for the 2e-oxidized complexes. Also, strong electronic communication between two porphyrin rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins present while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. While unpaired spins of Fe(III) and the porphyrin &#960;-cation radical are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled, such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and a porphyrin &#960;-cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;-cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e-oxidized complexes of dimanganese(III) and copper(II)-manganese(III) porphyrin dimers as compared to their diiron(III) and copper(II)-iron(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of a &#960;-cation radical and copper(II) is much stronger in the 2e-oxidized complex of copper(II)-iron(III) porphyrin dimer as compared to its copper(II)-manganese(III) analog.

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (Di)Azatricyclododecene Scaffold and Its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffolds have the potential to provide unique bioactivity, which cannot be achieved by conventional flat aromatic ring&#8208;based compounds. (Di)Azatricyclododecene scaffold with a bridged tricyclic system was developed and applied to design peptidomimetics with a 3D scaffold. The designed peptidomimetics showed inhibition of HIF transcription activity and antiviral activity toward rabies virus, both of which &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mediated interaction play a pivotal role.







Abstract
A novel sp3 carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. Tricyclic framework 7 was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one (11) via a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor 12&#8201;b&#8211;e was the key to forming 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized product 7 with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework 7, a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a, which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics 21&#8201;a&#8211;u were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold 8&#8201;a. Compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;h were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z=Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy, and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound 21&#8201;a showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC50=4.1&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;M), whereas compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;g showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 4.2&#8211;12.4&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.

         <title>Nucleophilicities and Nucleofugalities of Thio&#8208; and Selenoethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong nucleophiles and weak Lewis bases: Kinetic studies by laser flash photolytic methods reveal that dialkyl sulfides and selenides are strong nucleophiles, comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole. Because of their low Lewis basicity (6 to 7 orders of magnitude lower than that of pyridine with respect to C&#8208;centred Lewis acids) they are also good nucleofuges, which makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents. Low Marcus intrinsic barriers account for the different ranking of dialkyl chalcogenides in nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity scales.







Abstract
Rate constants for the reactions of dialkyl chalcogenides with laser flash photolytically generated benzhydrylium ions have been measured photometrically to integrate them into the comprehensive benzhydrylium&#8208;based nucleophilicity scale. Combining these rate constants with the previously reported equilibrium constants for the same reactions provided the corresponding Marcus intrinsic barriers and made it possible to quantify the leaving group abilities (nucleofugalities) of dialkyl sulfides and dimethyl selenide. Due to the low intrinsic barriers, dialkyl chalcogenides are fairly strong nucleophiles (comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole) as well as good nucleofuges; this makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing &#1013;&#8208;Benzosultams by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt&#8208;Promoted Hydrophosphonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial ingredients: The first highly enantioselective hydrophosphonylation of seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl imines by bifunctional phosphonium salt catalysis has been developed, and a broad range of optically pure phosphorus&#8208;containing &#1013;&#8208;benzosultam compounds was readily prepared under mild conditions with very low catalyst loading, easy purification and high yields. The practicality and utility of this protocol were demonstrated by scaled&#8208;up reactions and facile synthetic elaborations. The mechanistic results suggested that the ion&#8208;pair and H&#8208;bonding interactions were crucial in asymmetric induction.







Abstract
&#1013;&#8208;Benzosultam derivatives are potential drug candidates with diverse biological activities. A series of chiral &#1013;&#8208;benzosultams bearing phosphorus functionalities was synthesized by catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphonylation in the presence of a bifunctional phosphonium salt catalyst. The desired hydrophosphonylation products were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities, and scale&#8208;up reactions and further derivations were successfully accomplished. Some control experiments were also conducted to elucidate the plausible reaction mechanism of this chemical transformation.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that, for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8208;O. Norrby, K. W&#228;rnmark, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100890).

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nanomaterials are indispensable to modern technologies and their low&#8208;temperature synthesis is a key&#8208;step to their incorporation in technologically advanced areas. In our pursuit to identify the reagents that are reactive at low temperature, we exploit here the inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand as a strategy to obtain molecular complexes with ultra&#8208;low decomposition temperature and explore their application as facile precursors to highly crystalline metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Mishra et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101471).

         <title>What is the Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can It be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation of arginine residues in histones is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation, and its dysregulation results in human diseases such as cancer and brain disorders. This study reveals the catalytic mechanism of the demethylation of methylated arginine R3 in H4 histone by a non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone demethylase 4E (KDM4E). Applying QM/MM and MD, we explored both C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H activations pathways. Importantly, the study revealed that by applying external electric fields (EEFs), we can modulate the C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H selectivities. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Z. Christov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101174).

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have received less attention compared with other C&#8208;heteroatom couplings. Most reported examples comprise the thioetherification of most reactive aryl iodides with aromatic thiols. The use of C&#8208;O electrophiles in this context is almost uncharted. Here we describe that preformed Ni(II) precatalysts of the type NiCl(allyl)(PMe  2  Ar&#8217;) (Ar&#8217; = terphenyl group) efficiently couple a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides, including challenging aryl chlorides, with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Aryl and alkenyl tosylates are also well tolerated demonstrating, for the first time, to be competent electrophilic partners in Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S bond formation. The chemoselective functionalization of the C&#8208;I bond in the presence of C&#8208;Cl bond allows for designing site&#8208;selective tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N couplings. The formation of the two C&#8208;heteroatom bonds takes place in a single operation and represents a rare example of dual electrophile/nucleophile chemoselective process.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron processes Ag(I/III) is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon Ag(III) species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of Ag(III) towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; is theoretically analyzed (X = F to At). Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable Ag(III)&#8211;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. In fact, the whole series of non&#8208;radiative halide complexes [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX] (X = F to I) has been experimentally prepared and isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgN&#8323;] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido&#8208;complex. Except for the iodo&#8208;compound, the crystal structures have been established by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF&#8323;AgX]&#8315; and [FAgX]&#8315; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; demonstrates that the Ag&#8211;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The experimentally established compatibility of Ag(III) with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or &#8208;catalyzed processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroarenes Utilizing Amide Solvent as Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was achieved using  N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;  &#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;  para  &#8208;phenylenediamine  (1  ) as a strong photoreduction catalyst. This reaction was applicable not only to electron&#8208;rich monofluoroarenes but also to polyfluoroarenes to afford non&#8208;fluorinated arenes. The experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays an important role for regeneration of the photocatalyst, enabling additive&#8208;free photoreduction catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide assisted covalent triazine framework for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with two&#8208;dimensional structures have exhibited promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution performance. However, it is still a challenge to improve its activity. Herein, we report &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. The CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material was obtained by a facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in the presence of GO. The results of photocatalytic H2 evolution indicate that the optimum hybrid, CTF&#8208;1/GO&#8208;3.0, exhibited an H2 evolution rate of 2262.4 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the GO in CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrids not only acts as an electron collector and transporter like a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges but also shortens the electron migration path due to its thin sheet layer uniformly distribution over CTF&#8208;1. This work could help future development of novel conjugated CTF&#8208;based composite materials as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in surface organometallic chemistry have enabled the detailed characterization of the surface species in single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts. However, the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of the supporting surface.

The grafting of the precursors on silica supports (MCM&#8208;41 and CARiACT Q10) proceeded through a substitution reaction on the silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand, which was verified by the detection of isobutene and  t  BuOH as the elimination products, to selectively yield bis&#8208;grafted surface species. The chemical structure of the surface species was characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, and the chemical shift values of the ancillary ligands and  195  Pt nuclei suggested that the bidentate coordination sphere was maintained following grafting.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescence Sensor Array Based on Zinc(II)&#8208;Carboxyamidoquinolines: Toward Quantitative Detection of ATP**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent carboxyamidoquinoline&#8208;zinc(II) assemblies were investigated as sensors for biologically relevant phosphate anions in water at low concentrations (micromolar). Analyte&#8208;specific changes in fluorescence allow for differentiation of inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, ADP, and ATP from eight other anionic analytes in a HEPES buffer. A fluorescence based array enabled quantitative analysis of ATP in the concentration range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (1&#8211;3) and their Zn(II) complexes (Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence. Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 assemblies interact with adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte&#8208;specific response. This process was investigated using UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enable differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi), and phosphate (Pi). The cross&#8208;reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines&#8208;Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) with 100&#8201;% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M concentration in unknown samples with error &lt;2.5&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and their Zn(II) complexes (&lt;b&gt;Zn@1-Zn@3&lt;/b&gt;) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the &lt;b&gt;Zn@1-Zn@3&lt;/b&gt; complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;-triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence. &lt;b&gt;Zn@1-Zn@3&lt;/b&gt; assemblies interact with adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte-specific response. This process was investigated using UV-vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enable differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;-diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi), and phosphate (Pi). The cross-reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines-Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;-monophosphate (AMP) with 100&#8201;% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M concentration in unknown samples with error &amp;lt;2.5&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar biphenyl is a stable minimum on the quantum mechanical potential energy surface of the crystal. The lack of thermal disorder in the phase I at 100&#8197;K and the properties of the experimental and theoretical electron densities support this conclusion. The crystal packing is mostly determined by intra and intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonding, non&#8208;covalent 
 interactions and internal rotation of the biphenyl molecule.







Abstract
A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100&#8197;K were subjected to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average of two twisted configurations in a double&#8208;well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H and the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.

1H MAS NMR experiment of ethane/ethylene mixtures adsorbed on ZIFs facilitates the precise determination of the adsorption selectivity. The adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interactions between ethane/ethylene and ZIFs are directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Host&#8208;Guest Interaction in Ethylene and Ethane Separation on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Revealed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy (Deng)







Abstract
The separation of ethane/ethylene mixture by using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as adsorbents is strongly associated with the pore size&#8208;sieving effect and the adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is utilized to explore the host&#8208;guest interaction and ethane/ethylene separation mechanism on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Preferential access to the ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;90 frameworks by ethane compared to ethylene is directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion MAS NMR spectroscopy and further verified by computational density distributions. The 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy provides an alternative for straightforwardly extracting the adsorption selectivity of ethane/ethylene mixture at 1.1&#8764;9.6&#8197;bar in ZIFs, which is consistent with the IAST predictions.

         <title>Unveiling Polymerization Mechanism in pH&#8208;regulated Supramolecular Fibers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and self&#8208;assembly in aqueous media of an amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene is reported. A dramatic change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed upon modifying the pH, which is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization and copolymerization processes.







Abstract
An amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein, a detailed mechanistic study is reported, carried out upon modifying the pH to trigger the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.

         <title>Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Modified Nickel Oxide Nanocrystals and Their Applications as Hole&#8208;Injection layers for Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification strategy to anchor Cu species onto the surfaces of as&#8208;prepared NiOx nanocrystals, leading to Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals was developed. The low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) films based on the NiOx&#8208;Cu nanocrystals show enhanced conductance, which is beneficial for use as hole&#8208;injection layers for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed NiOx thin films have been applied as hole&#8208;injection layers (HILs) in quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The commonly used NiOx HILs are prepared by the precursor&#8208;based route, which requires high annealing temperatures of over 275&#8201;&#176;C to in&#8197;situ convert the precursors into oxide films. Such high processing temperatures of NiOx HILs hinder their applications in flexible devices. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature approach based on Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals to prepare HILs. A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification step, which anchors the copper agents onto the surfaces of oxide nanocrystals, is developed to improve the electrical conductivity of the low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) oxide&#8208;nanocrystal thin films. In consequence, QLEDs based on the NiOx&#8208;Cu HILs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% and a T95 operational lifetime of &#8764;2,800&#8197;h at an initial brightness of 1,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, meeting the commercialization requirements for display applications. The results shed light on the potential of using NiOx&#8208;Cu HILs for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible QLEDs.

Furthermore, liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation was carried out to obtain a WO3 dispersion that could be directly used to fabricate thin films by the spray&#8208;coating method. WO3 thin films were used as electrodes in supercapacitors and photo&#8208;electrochemical water oxidation.







Abstract
Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique for use in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others, by a lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature is reported. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE was carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in 22 different solvents; among the solvents studied, the propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol/water (1&#8201;:&#8201;1) co&#8208;solvent system appeared to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of the co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point solvent enable thin films of various thickness to be fabricated by using spray coating. The obtained thin films were used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 5&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. Photo&#8208;electrochemical measurements revealed that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water oxidation.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Nerve Agents and Their Organophosphorus Surrogates:&#160;Toward Supramolecular Scavengers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nerve agents are tetrahedral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) that were developed in the last century to irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and therefore impede neurological signaling in living organisms. Exposure to OPs leads to a rapid development of symptoms from excessive salivation, nasal congestion and chest pain to convulsion and asphyxiation which if left untreated may lead to death. These potent toxins are prepared on a large scale from inexpensive staring materials, making it feasible for terrorist groups or states to use them against military and civilians. The existing antidotes provide limited protection and are difficult to apply to a large number of affected individuals. While new prophylactics are currently being developed, there is still need for therapeutics capable of both preventing and reversing the effects of OP poisoning. In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.</dc:description>

In undivided cells, a wide variety of indoles and alcohol compounds are examined to a&#64256;ord amide ester aromatics without using extra oxidants and stoichiometric metal catalysts, which avoids the formation of undesired by&#8208;products and exhibits high atom economy.

         <dc:description>
How TOCs tick: Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles.







Abstract
Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters, with more than 300 examples characterized by X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles by comparing the different cluster types.

         <title>Factors Controlling the Aluminium(I)&#8208;meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H Activation in Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, namely the activation strain model of reactivity and energy decomposition analysis, has been applied to quantitatively unveil the origin of the selectivity of the transformation as well as the influence of the associated potassium cation. It is found that the selectivity takes place during the initial nucleophilic addition step where the key LP(Al)&#8594;&#960;*(C=C) molecular orbital interaction is more stabilizing for the meta&#8208;pathway, which results in a stronger interaction between the reactants along the entire transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcination&#8208;Free Synthesis of Well&#8208;Dispersed and Sub&#8208;10 nm Spinel Ferrite Nanoparticles as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Case Study of CoFe2O4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10 nm CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles obtained by traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe  2  O  4  , MgFe  2  O  4  , ZnFe  2  O  4  , and so on.</dc:description>

         <title>FeII Metallohelices Stabilize DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes and Downregulate the Expression of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Regulated Oncogenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Holding on and holding down: DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) represent attractive targets for cancer therapy. We show that metallohelices, which exhibit bioactivity emulating that of natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and inhibit the activity of DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures. Moreover, the investigated metallohelices downregulate the expression oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at the mRNA and protein levels, thus holding promise as potential multitarget drugs.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy, and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, molecular biophysics and biology methods were employed to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (hTelo, c&#8208;myc, c&#8208;kit1, c&#8208;kit2) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (hTelo) and in the promoter regions of c&#8208;MYC and c&#8208;KIT proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible, optically pure metallohelices, which are made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around FeII ions and exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity to duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of a metallohelix containing a m&#8208;xylenyl bridge (5&#8201;b) were found to effectively inhibit primer elongation catalyzed by Taq DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing c&#8208;myc and c&#8208;kit2 G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of 5&#8201;b downregulated the expression of c&#8208;MYC and c&#8208;KIT oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multitargeted drugs.

         <title>Recyclable Supramolecular Assembly&#8208;Induced Emission System for Selective Detection and Efficient Removal of Mercury(II)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular functional system with appreciable photoluminescent properties on the basis of the supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) mechanism is successfully constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions, which shows great potentials in simultaneously selective detection and efficient removal of Hg2+ from water owing to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complexes. This system also possesses excellent regeneration ability without the loss of adsorption activity.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for simultaneously detecting and removing Hg2+ from water is vital to address mercury pollution. Herein a supramolecular assembly G&#8834;H with photoluminescent properties is facilely constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of a functional pillar[5]arene bearing two N,N&#8208;dimethyldithiocarbamoyl binding sites (H) and an AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene derivative (G). Remarkably, the fluorescence of G&#8834;H can be exclusively quenched by Hg2+ among the 30 cations due to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complex and only L&#8208;cysteine can restore fluorescence in the common 20 amino acids. Meanwhile, the probe G&#8834;H has a considerable thermal and pH stability, a good anti&#8208;interference property from various cations, and a satisfactory sensitivity. More importantly, G&#8834;H exhibits a prominent capability of Hg2+ removal with rapid capture rate (within 1&#8197;h) and excellent adsorption efficiency (98&#8201;%), as well as a highly efficient recyclability without losing any adsorption activity.

         <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to Carbene&#8208;M&#8208;Amido (M=Cu, Ag, Au) Complexes for Luminescence and Photocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

N&#8722;H metallation routes: Interest in carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes of the coinage metals has inspired comprehensive efforts towards simplifying their synthesis. We now showcase simple and sustainable routes to various CMAs, using mild conditions for the N&#8722;H metallation of carbazole and other amines. The action of a mild base is studied computationally and the photophysical properties of some new CMA complexes are examined.







Abstract
The development of novel and operationally simple synthetic routes to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes of copper, silver and gold relevant for photonic applications are reported. A mild base and sustainable solvents allow all reactions to be conducted in air and at room temperature, leading to high yields of the targeted compounds even on multigram scales. The effect of various mild bases on the N&#8722;H metallation was studied in silico and experimentally, while a mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free synthetic approach was also developed. Our photophysical studies on [M(NHC)(Cbz)] (Cbz=carbazolyl) indicate that the occurrence of fluorescent or phosphorescent states is determined primarily by the metal, providing control over the excited state properties. Consequently, we demonstrate the potential of the new CMAs beyond luminescence applications by employing a selected CMA as a photocatalyst. The exemplified synthetic ease is expected to accelerate the applications of CMAs in photocatalysis and materials chemistry.

         <title>Uncovering the Hidden Landscape of Tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) Ligands: Topological Complexity Derived from the Bridgehead</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power to change: the new heavy main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands E(4&#8208;py)3 (E=Sb, Bi) build into topologically complex MOFs with AgI, in which the bridgehead atom plays an important role in structure direction. The E(4&#8208;py)3 ligands can function as pyramidal or tetrahedral nodes, an ability that is modulated by the Lewis basicity (stereochemical activity) of the Group 15 element.







Abstract
Supramolecular main group chemistry is a developing field which parallels the conventional domain of metallo&#8208;organic chemistry. Little explored building blocks in this area are main group metal&#8208;based ligands which have the appropriate donor symmetry to build desired molecular or extended arrangements. Tris(pyridyl) main group ligands (E(py)3, E=main group metal) are potentially highly versatile building blocks since shifting the N&#8208;donor arms from the 2&#8208; to the 3&#8208;positions and 4&#8208;positions provides a very simple way of changing the ligand character from mononuclear/chelating to multidentate/metal&#8208;bridging. Here, the coordination behaviour of the first main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands, E(4&#8208;py)3 (E=Sb, Bi, Ph&#8722;Sn) is explored, as well as their ability to build metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The complicated topology of these MOFs shows a marked influence on the counter anion and on the ability of the E(4&#8208;py)3 ligands to switch coordination mode, depending on the steric and donor character of the bridgehead. This structure&#8208;directing influence of the bridgehead provides a potential building strategy for future molecular and MOF design in this area.

Tris(pyridyl) main group ligands (E(py)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, E=main group metal) are potentially highly versatile building blocks since shifting the N-donor arms from the 2- to the 3-positions and 4-positions provides a very simple way of changing the ligand character from mononuclear/chelating to multidentate/metal-bridging. Here, the coordination behaviour of the first main group metal tris(4-pyridyl) ligands, E(4-py)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (E=Sb, Bi, Ph&#8722;Sn) is explored, as well as their ability to build metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The complicated topology of these MOFs shows a marked influence on the counter anion and on the ability of the E(4-py)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands to switch coordination mode, depending on the steric and donor character of the bridgehead. This structure-directing influence of the bridgehead provides a potential building strategy for future molecular and MOF design in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Taking Advantage of Ortho&#8208; and Peri&#8208;Substitution to Design Nine&#8208;Membered P,O,Si&#8208;heterocycles**

         <dc:description>
A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds has been prepared. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform and the Si substituents. Despite some steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.







Abstract
A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds has been prepared and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray structure, which enables a detailed structural analysis. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform (Nap and Ace) as well as the Si substituents (Me and Ph). Despite a strong steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive toward oxidation or coordination. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. All the compounds display absorption/luminescence in the UV&#8208;Vis range. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.

Opening up open&#8208;shell molecular systems: We investigated the influence of AuI&#8722;AuI (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multispin molecular systems by using multinuclear&#8208;AuI complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anions. Among these complexes, the one in which an aurophilic interaction was observed by structural analysis showed characteristic spin&#8722;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and a solvatochromic behavior.







Abstract
Multinuclear AuI complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anion and phosphine&#8208;ligand scaffolds, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;m, and (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;p, have been synthesized to investigate the influence of AuI&#8722;AuI (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multispin molecular systems. The desired complexes were successfully prepared in moderate yields in a one&#8208;pot synthesis from the corresponding phosphine ligand, AuI source, parent NN, and sodium hydroxide. Among the prepared complexes, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o, in which an aurophilic interaction was clearly observed by crystal structure analysis, showed characteristic spin&#8722;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and solvatochromic behavior. The results from theoretical calculations also suggested that the differences in properties between complex (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o and the other complexes are due to intramolecular aurophilic interactions.

         <title>Versatile Reaction Pathways of 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Pentafluoropropene at Rh(I) Complexes [Rh(E)(PEt3)3] (E=H, GePh3, Si(OEt)3, F, Cl): C&#8208;F versus C&#8208;H Bond Activation Steps</title>

Studies on the reactivity of 1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene towards rhodium(I) complexes revealed versatile reaction pathways, such as coordination, C&#8722;F and C&#8722;H bond activation steps. Fluorido ligands play a key role for the reactivity pattern observed.







Abstract
The reaction of the rhodium(I) complexes [Rh(E)(PEt3)3] (E=GePh3 (1), H (6), F (7)) with 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene afforded the defluorinative germylation products Z/E&#8208;2&#8208;(triphenylgermyl)&#8208;1,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene and the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)2] (2) together with the fluorophosphorane E&#8208;(CF3)CH=CF(PFEt3). For [Rh(Si(OEt)3)(PEt3)3] (4) the coordination of the fluoroolefin was found to give [Rh{Si(OEt)3}(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)2] (5). Two equivalents of complex 2 reacted further by C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition to yield [Rh(CF=CHCF3)(PEt3)2(&#956;&#8208;F)3Rh(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)] (9). The role of the fluorido ligand on the reactivity of complex 2 was assessed by comparison with the analogous chlorido complex. The use of complexes 1, 4 and 6 as catalysts for the derivatization of 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene provided products, which were generated by hydrodefluorination, hydrometallation and germylation reactions.

         <title>Establishing a &#8220;Ring&#8208;Size&#8208;Divergent&#8221; Synthetic Strategy: Synthesis, Structural Revision, and Absolute Configuration of Feroniellins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Running rings around ethers: A &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy enabled us to divergently synthesize the five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered ether rings of feroniellin analogs from diepoxides under simple acidic or neutral conditions in only two steps from bergamottin. Additionally, the proposed structures of feroniellins A and B were revised, and the absolute configurations of all feroniellins were determined from their asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
Feroniellin analogs isolated from Feroniella lucida possess a furanocoumarin skeleton connected to monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings by an ether linkage and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this contribution, we intended to establish a &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; synthetic strategy for the monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings through the chemical sythesis of feroniellins. The short and comprehensive synthesis of feroniellins was achieved in only two steps from easily available bergamottin based on the &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy. In addition, these syntheses resulted in revision of the proposed structures for feroniellins A and B and the determination of all the absolute configurations of feroniellins; their preliminary anti&#8208;inflammatory activities were investigated as well.

&lt;p&gt;Feroniellin analogs isolated from &lt;i&gt;Feroniella lucida&lt;/i&gt; possess a furanocoumarin skeleton connected to monoterpenic five- to seven-membered ethereal rings by an ether linkage and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this contribution, we intended to establish a &#8220;ring-size-divergent&#8221; synthetic strategy for the monoterpenic five- to seven-membered ethereal rings through the chemical sythesis of feroniellins. The short and comprehensive synthesis of feroniellins was achieved in only two steps from easily available bergamottin based on the &#8220;ring-size-divergent&#8221; strategy. In addition, these syntheses resulted in revision of the proposed structures for feroniellins A and B and the determination of all the absolute configurations of feroniellins; their preliminary anti-inflammatory activities were investigated as well.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free Au(I) Catalysis Enabled by Bifunctional Urea&#8208; and Squaramide&#8208;Phosphine Ligands via H&#8208;Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I) chloride complexes with bifunctional phosphino(thio)urea and phosphinosquaramide ligands have been designed to be catalytically active in the absence of silver additives in intra&#8208; and intermolecular reactions of alkynes. Structure&#8208;activity relationships, DFT calculations focused on the Au&#8722;Cl bond activation, and comprehensive kinetic studies highlight the key role of the H&#8208;bond donor group in enabling catalysis at the Au(I) center.







Abstract
A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;Phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communication between ionic dyes: New triangular rhodamine triads were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized as isolated trications in the gas phase. Fluorescence spectra reveal efficient energy transfer from one dye (rhodamine 575) to another (rhodamine 640) despite of electrostatic screening by the &#960;&#8208;spacer. No spectral shift due to the internal Coulomb repulsion between the dyes was observed.







Abstract
When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions in vacuo. We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in D3h configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.

         <title>Highly Efficient Trityl&#8208;nitroxide Biradicals for Biomolecular High&#8208;field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful method to enhance the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state magnetic nuclear resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. However, its biomolecular applications at high magnetic fields (preferably &gt; 14 T) have so far been limited by the intrinsically low efficiency of polarizing agents and sample preparation aspects. Herein, we report a new class of trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols that combine high DNP efficiency with greatly enhanced hydrophilicity. SNAPol&#8208;1, the best compound in the series, shows DNP enhancement factors at 18.8 T of more than 100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibits strong DNP enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. By integrating optimal sensitivity and high resolution, we expect widespread applications of this new polarizing agent in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.</dc:description>

&#8220;In this work, we have employed the innovative supercritical water&#8208;based technology for synthesising high crystalline calcium silicate hydrate nanominerals, finely controlling the Si&#8208;OH and Ca&#8208;OH contents. A key result of this study relies on the observation, for the first time, of a transformation from an ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; water distribution in the Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystal to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; one in the Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich counterpart.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>PorphyStruct &#8211; A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Porphyrinoid out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortions have been in the focus of the group's research since our finding of a saddling mode being related to copper corrole non&#8208;innocence in 2007. Such modes could be quantified using J.&#8197;A. Shelnutts NSD method (normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition), but unfortunately the analysis was exclusive to metal porphyrins and metal chlorins. PorphyStruct is the result from our attempts to quantify these distortions for many different porphyrinoids with little effort, while retaining the established terminology.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Jens Krumsieck and Martin Br&#246;ring from the TU Braunschweig, Germany.

&#8220;We present an improved version of a rotaxane&#8208;based system in which unidirectional threading and dethreading of the molecular components can be carried out repeatedly under stationary optical excitation in solution. By performing the photoreaction in the probe of the NMR spectrometer, we were able to investigate the photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium behavior of the system, and in particular distinguish between kinetically trapped and stationary dissipative regimes.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Polymer Nanodiscs and their Bioanalytical Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins (MPs) play a pivotal role in cellular function and are therefore predominant pharmaceutical targets. Although detailed understanding of MP structure and mechanistic activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with the purification and study of MPs. This review delves into historical developments preluding the currently available membrane mimetic technologies before shining a spotlight on polymer nanodiscs. These are soluble nanosized particles capable of encompassing MPs embedded in a phospholipid annular. The expanding range of reported amphipathic polymer nanodisc materials are presented and discussed in terms of their tolerance to different solution conditions and their nanodisc properties. Finally, the analytical scope of polymer nanodiscs is considered in both the demonstration of basic nanodisc parameters as well as in the elucidation of structures, lipid&#8208;protein interactions, and functional mechanisms of reconstituted membrane proteins. The final emphasis is given to the unique benefits and applications demonstrated for native nanodiscs accessed through a detergent free process.</dc:description>

A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields  . Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu  +  contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI&#8208;GD is coupled with flower&#8208;like  NiAl&#8208;LDH  to produce H  2  from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing cross&#8208;coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of  CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH  has a 15&#8208; and 216&#8208;fold enhancement compared with CuI&#8208;GD and NiAl&#8208;LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process was proposed to insight understand the interaction among these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic d8&#8211;d10 Coupling of Rh(I) and M(0) (M=Pd, Pt) in a Sandwich Framework of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich framework of &#960;&#8208;conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands was found to provide a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back&#8208;donation allows the formation of a d&#963;&#8208;type Rh&#8208;Pd bond in a (d&#8208;d)18 electron system.

     alt="Heterometallic d8&#8211;d10 Coupling of Rh(I) and M(0) (M=Pd, Pt) in a Sandwich Framework of &#960;-Conjugated Ligands"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sandwich framework of &#960;-conjugated&lt;/b&gt; unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands was found to provide a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron-accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back-donation allows the formation of a d&#963;-type Rh-Pd bond in a (d-d)&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electron system.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Iron(VI), Low&#8208;Spin Ruthenium(VI), and Magnetically Bistable Osmium(VI) in Molecular Group 8 Nitrido Trifluorides NMF3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In different states: Molecular hexavalent group 8 nitrido fluorides feature different electronic ground&#8208;state d2 configurations in solid Ne matrices. While NFeF3 adopts a high symmetry structure, the heavier homologues are subject to symmetry lowering and spin&#8208;crossover caused by a pseudo Jahn&#8722;Teller effect &#8220;hidden&#8221; in the excited states. For NOsF3 two coexisting high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin structures show triplet&#8211;singlet spin crossover and magnetic bistability. A weakened covalent N&#8722;Fe bond in NFeVIF3 indicates the non&#8208;innocent character of the nitrido ligand.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral nitrido trifluorides N&#8801;MF3 (M=Fe, Ru, Os) and square pyramidal nitrido tetrafluorides N&#8801;MF4 (M=Ru, Os) were formed by free&#8208;metal&#8208;atom reactions with NF3 and subsequently isolated in solid neon at 5&#8197;K. Their IR spectra were recorded and analyzed aided by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. For a d2 electron configuration of the N&#8801;MF3 compounds in C3v symmetry, Hund's rule predict a high&#8208;spin 3A2 ground state with two parallel spin electrons and two degenerate metal d(&#948;)&#8208;orbitals. The corresponding high&#8208;spin 3A2 ground state was, however, only found for N&#8801;FeF3, the first experimentally verified neutral nitrido FeVI species. The valence&#8208;isoelectronic N&#8801;RuF3 and N&#8801;OsF3 adopt different angular distorted singlet structures. For N&#8801;RuF3, the triplet 3A2 state is only 5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy than the singlet 1A&#8242; ground state, and the magnetically bistable molecular N&#8801;OsF3 with two distorted near degenerate 1A&#8242; and 3A&#8220; electronic states were experimentally detected at 5&#8197;K in solid neon.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipid phase mediated photo&#8208;click cycloaddition between photo&#8208;generated nitrile imines and energy&#8208;storable dibenzo[c,g][1,2]diazocine (DBDA) was established, including optimized biocompatibility and highly spatiotemporal resolution as well. A supramolecular assembly of the photo&#8208;switchable DBDA monopeptides was also exploited to implant the DBDA moiety on live cell membranes for studying their dynamics via the photo&#8208;click reaction by using digital micromirror device (DMD) chip.







Abstract
A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;l&#8208;alanine (cis&#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on C&#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the cis&#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into trans&#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo&#8208;click reactions between the monopeptides and photo&#8208;generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of alkanes, particularly monobranched and dibranched isomers, is of paramount importance in petrochemical industry for optimizing the feedstock of ethylene production as well as for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Here we report the full separation of linear/monobranched alkanes from their dibranched isomers by a robust and easily scalable metal&#8208;organic framework material, Co3(HCOO)6. The compound completely excludes dibranched alkanes but adsorbs their linear and monobranched isomers, as evidenced by single&#8208;component and multicomponent adsorption measurements. More importantly, the material exhibits excellent performance in separating naphtha and is capable of providing high quality feedstock for the production of ethylene and gasoline components with high octane number, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation in petrochemical industry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven supramolecular pumping was achieved, as a result of unidirectional threading and dethreading movements, by combining photoisomerization and self&#8208;assembly processes in a closed reaction network (represented by reservoirs and pipes in the cover image). While light irradiation (bulb and gears) pushes the species energetically uphill, subsequent exergonic reactions (falling water) convert energy into motion, and a continuous and directional transfer along the cycle (the water flow) is observed at the photostationary state.

Lawsone is naturally obtained from Henna plant leaves (as shown in the cover image), which are responsible for the red&#8208;orange pigment properties. It is well known in the cosmetic industry as a natural coloring agent for hair, nails, and skin. Over the centuries, lawsone has been frequently used as a natural beauty product, but the pharmaceutical applications of lawsone and its analogs are still underexplored. To fulfill these shortcomings, we started utilizing lawsone as a synthon for a new class of cascade reactions to synthesize structurally complex molecules, which are analogues of biologically and pharmaceutically active molecules. We sincerely thank Dr. M. A. Pasha for the excellent design of the cover. More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;B. Ramachary et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100985).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lawsone is naturally obtained from Henna plant leaves&lt;/b&gt; (as shown in the cover image), which are responsible for the red-orange pigment properties. It is well known in the cosmetic industry as a natural coloring agent for hair, nails, and skin. Over the centuries, lawsone has been frequently used as a natural beauty product, but the pharmaceutical applications of lawsone and its analogs are still underexplored. To fulfill these shortcomings, we started utilizing lawsone as a synthon for a new class of cascade reactions to synthesize structurally complex molecules, which are analogues of biologically and pharmaceutically active molecules. We sincerely thank Dr. M. A. Pasha for the excellent design of the cover. More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;B. Ramachary et&#8197;al.

         <title>PorphyStruct: A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PorphyStruct is a new digital tool that allows quick and easy analyses of hidden conformational features of porphyrinoids from structural data. The software introduces the well&#8208;established technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter. The cover image shows the utopia of a futuristic analysis laboratory where life&#8208;size molecules are analysed for such hidden structural characteristics. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;Krumsieck and M.&#8197;Br&#246;ring. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101243).

         <title>Rationalizing the Mechanism of Peroxyformate Decomposition: Computational Insights To Understand Solvent Influence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effects revealed: An exhaustive mechanistic investigation into the decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate based on DFT calculations sheds light on how the reaction proceeds and how it is modulated depending on the nature and polarity of the surrounding medium. The computed mechanistic pathways are in excellent agreement with the experimental trends for a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents.







Abstract
The heterolytic decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate to tert&#8208;butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long&#8208;known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity. From DFT and ab initio methods together with the SMD implicit solvation model, an extension on the formerly accepted mechanism is proposed. This novel proposal involves the formation of a carbonic acid ester intermediate and its further decomposition, through an unreported pyridine&#8208;mediated stepwise route. Computed barriers for this mechanism at DLPNO/CCSD(T)&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP are in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data across different solvents. Furthermore, the strong relationships between activation energies, geometric parameters in the transition state and the characteristics of the different solvents are also analyzed in depth.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast synthesis of calcium silicate hydrates was performed in supercritical water that acts as a solvent for mimicking the natural conditions at high pressure and high temperature of the geological process. The synthesised xonotlite and tobermorite represent perfect Ca&#8722;OH&#8208;rich and Si&#8722;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals for investigating the effect of different chemical environments on the dynamics of confined water. These results could be applied to other water&#8208;containing construction materials. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;S. Dolado, C. Aymonier et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>
A silyl hydride derivative of d&#8208;glucal was used conveniently as a bench&#8208;stable precursor for the construction of C&#8208;glycosidic bond. After activation by fluoride&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative hydrolysis, an intermediate silanol species was used for Hiyama arylation. Various aryl and heteroaryl C&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycopeptides, as well as both a&#8208; and b&#8208;isomers of Dapagliflozin could be constructed rapidly and without the need for protecting groups.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosin A&#8722;F Aglycone via Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrovinylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applied metal catalysis: Exploiting a practical protocol for the asymmetric hydrovinylation of stryrenes in the opening move, the stereoselective total synthesis of bioactive constituents of the soft coral pseudopterogorgia elisabethae was efficiently achieved in sequence of metal&#8208;mediated steps to provide sufficient material for further biological investigations.







Abstract
Due to their pronounced bioactivity and limited availability from natural resources, metabolites of the soft coral Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, such as erogorgiaene and the pseudopterosines, represent important target molecules for chemical synthesis. We have now developed a particularly short and efficient route towards these marine diterpenes exploiting an operationally convenient enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation as the chirogenic step. Other noteworthy C&#8722;C bond forming transformations include diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations, a Suzuki coupling and a carbonyl ene reaction. Starting from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene the anti&#8208;tubercular agent (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene (&gt;98&#8201;% ee) was prepared in only 7 steps with 46&#8201;% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis of the pseudopterosin A aglycone was achieved in 12 steps with 30&#8201;% overall yield and, surprisingly, was found to exhibit a similar anti&#8208;inflammatory activity (inhibition of LPS&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation) as a natural mixture of pseudopterosins A&#8722;D or iso&#8208;pseudopterosin A, prepared by &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;xylosylation of the synthetic aglycone.

         <title>Low concentration C2H6 capture enabled by size matching in the ultramicropore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C 2 H 6 interaction and large C 2 H 6 uptake at low&#8208;concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large p K a value and small quadrupole moment of C 2 H 6 . Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6 &#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4 &#197;) in a nickel pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate metal&#8208;organic framework ( PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni ), which enables the record&#8208;breaking performance for low concentration C 2 H 6 capture. PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni exhibits the large C 2 H 6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7 kJ/mol, and record&#8208;high C 2 H 6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01&#8208;0.1 bar and 298 K (1.8 mmol/g at 0.01 bar). Molecule simulations and C 2 H 6 &#8208;loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni with ethane molecule originates the strong C 2 H 6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C 2 H 6 /N 2 (1/999, v / v ) and C 2 H 6 /CH 4 (5/95, v / v ) proved the excellent low&#8208;concentration C 2 H 6 capture performance.</dc:description>

The ideal physisorbent with strong C 2 H 6 interaction and large C 2 H 6 uptake at low-concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large p K a value and small quadrupole moment of C 2 H 6 . Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6 &#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4 &#197;) in a nickel pyridine-4-carboxylate metal-organic framework ( PC-4-Ni ), which enables the record-breaking performance for low concentration C 2 H 6 capture.

Molecule simulations and C 2 H 6 -loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in PC-4-Ni with ethane molecule originates the strong C 2 H 6 adsorption.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The F&#8208;actin stabilizing natural product geodiamolide H and its analogues were comprehensively investigated. The first total synthesis of geodiamolide H was enabled by optimized, scalable building block synthesis, improved couplings, and by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis as a key step. Biological profiling of the synthesized library in cells, on target, and in silico uncovered potent and simplified non&#8208;natural analogues. Additional structure&#8208;activity relationship information was extracted for the whole class, useful for tool compound design.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogues were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in&#8197;vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analogue of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.

         <title>Formulation of Next&#8208;Generation Multicompartment Microcapsules by Reversible Electrostatic Attraction</title>

Let&#8242;s assemble! Different active substances can be formulated within one carrier system. A novel melamine&#8208;formaldehyde/polyethyleneimine coating for microcapsules results in microcapsules with a positive surface charge. Based on electrostatic interactions with negative charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide and poly(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) nanocapsules, a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system was formed. Controlled assembling (pH&#8197;7) and disassembling (pH&#8197;3) between nanocapsules and microcapsules was demonstrated.







Abstract
The combination of several active substances into one carrier is often limited due to solubility, stability and phase&#8208;separation issues. These issues have been addressed by an innovative capsule design, in which nanocapsules are assembled on the microcapsule surface by electrostatic forces to form a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system. Here, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules with a negative surface charge were synthesized and coated with a novel MF&#8208;polyethyleneimine (PEI) copolymer to achieve a positive charge of &#950;=+28&#8197;mV. This novel coating procedure allows the electrostatic assembly of negatively charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide (PLLA, &#950;=&#8722;19&#8197;mV) and poly&#8208;(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) (PLGA, &#950;=&#8722;56&#8197;mV) nanocapsules on the microcapsule surface. Assembly studies at pH&#8197;7 gave a partial surface coverage of PLLA nanocapsules and full surface coverage for PLGA nanocapsules. The pH&#8208;responsive adsorption and desorption of nanocapsules was shown at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;3.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Spiro&#8208;double Sila[7]helicene: The LUMO Spiro&#8208;conjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9342-9349, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;double sila[7]helicene was synthesized through four successive nucleophilic substitutions on silicon atom. The two helicene units were symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. Delocalization of the LUMO orbital through the spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety lowered the LUMO energy, red&#8208;shifted the emission spectra, and enhanced polarization in the absorption.







Abstract
A double helicene with a spiro&#8208;Si linker (4) was synthesized by four successive nucleophilic substitutions on SiCl4. Its (P,P), (M,M) and (P,M) isomers were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the central spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety, the two helicene units in 4 are symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. (P,P)&#8208;4 and (M,M)&#8208;4 exhibit unique optical properties attributable to the LUMO spiro&#8208;conjugation between the two sila[7]helicene units.

Angling for the right result: Heteroleptic Pd cages containing two types of dipyridyl ligands are described. The common feature of these complexes is the presence of two 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligands (depicted in gray). By varying the ligand bent angle, &#945;, of the second ligand, we were able to able to increase the nuclearity of the assembly from 4 to 8.







Abstract
Spherical assemblies of the type [PdnL2n]2n+ can be obtained from PdII salts and curved N&#8208;donor ligands, L. It is well established that the bent angle, &#945;, of the ligand is a decisive factor in the self&#8208;assembly process, with larger angles leading to complexes with a higher nuclearity, n. Herein, we report heteroleptic coordination cages of the type [PdnLnL&#8242;n]2n+, for which a similar correlation between the ligand bent angle and the nuclearity is observed. Tetranuclear cages were obtained by combining [Pd(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 with 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and ligands featuring a bent angle of &#945;=120&#176;. The use of a dipyridyl ligand with &#945;=149&#176; led to the formation of a hexanuclear complex with a trigonal prismatic geometry; for linear ligands, octanuclear assemblies of the type [Pd8L8L&#8242;8]16+ were obtained. The predictable formation of heteroleptic PdII cages from 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene and different dipyridyl ligands is evidence that there are entire classes of heteroleptic cage structures that are privileged from a thermodynamic point of view.

         <title>Analysis of Non&#8208;innocence of Phosphaquinodimethane Ligands when Charge and Aromaticity Come into Play</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9350-9359, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to analyze their non&#8208;innocence character when ligated in M(CO)5 complexes, various phosphaquinodimethanes (pPQDM) and their complexes have been theoretically investigated regarding their electronic and structural properties, following corresponding changes in substitution, charge and spin state. Additionally, a combination of computed spin distributions and NICS values with geometric distortion models (HOMA, HOMQc) were used to gain further insights.







Abstract
Several phosphaquinodimethanes and their M(CO)5 complexes (M=Cr, Mo, W) and model derivatives have been theoretically investigated regarding the quest of non&#8208;innocence. Computed structural and electronic properties of the P&#8208;Me/NH2 substituted phosphaquinodimethanes and tungsten complexes revealed an interesting non&#8208;innocent ligand behaviour for the radical anion complexes with distonic ion character and a strong rearomatization of the middle phenyl ring. The latter was further probed taking also geometric aromaticity (HOMA) and quinoid distortion parameters (HOMQc) into account, as well as NICS(1). Furthermore, the effect of the P&#8208;substitution was investigated for real (or plausible) complexes and their free ligands focusing on the resulting aromaticity at the middle phenyl ring and vertical one&#8208;electron redox processes. The best picture of ligand engagement in redox changes was provided by representing NICS(1) values versus HOMA and the new geometric distortion parameter HOMQc8.

         <title>Soluble Congeners of Prior Insoluble Shape&#8208;Persistent Imine Cages</title>

Chains make the difference! By attaching three n&#8208;hexyloxy chains to a triptycene triamine precursor, various soluble [4+4] and [4+6] imine cages were synthesized that were prior insoluble, revealing detailed insights in cage formation and exchange mechanisms by NMR spectroscopy in combination with gel permeation chromatography. The cubic [4+4] cage once formed is extraordinarily stable against exchange, although it is a clear thermodynamically controlled product.







Abstract
One of the most applied reaction types to synthesize shape&#8208;persistent organic cage compounds is the imine condensation reaction and it is assumed that the formed cages are thermodynamically controlled products due to the reversibility of the imine condensation. However, most of the synthesized imine cages reported are formed as precipitate from the reaction mixture and therefore rather may be kinetically controlled products. There are even examples in literature, where resulting cages are not soluble at all in common organic solvents to characterize or study their formation by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Here, a triptycene triamine containing three solubilizing n&#8208;hexyloxy chains has been used to synthesize soluble congeners of prior insoluble cages. This allowed us to study the formation as well as the reversibility of cage formation in solution by investigating exchange of building blocks between the cages and deuterated derivatives thereof.

         <title>The Unusual Photochromic and Hydrochromic Switching Behavior of Cellulose&#8208;Embedded 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;Viologen Derivatives in the Solid&#8208;State</title>

Water and Light Triggered Chromic Switching! A series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads were found to exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid phase when embedded in a cellulose matrix. Relying on humidity&#8208;sensitive solid state fluorescence hydrochromism and photoreduction processes, the dyads could be cycled unidirectionally between three distinct chromic states. Mechanistic investigations provided new insights into the role of cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cations in the process.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials such as photochromics, hydrochromics, thermochromics, and electrochromics have a long history of capturing the attention of scientists due to their potential industrial applications and novelty in popular culture. However, hybrid chromic materials that combine two or more stimuli&#8208;triggered color changing properties are not so well known. Herein, we report a design strategy that has led to a series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads which exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid&#8208;state when embedded in a cellulose matrix. This behavior manifests as reversible solid state fluorescence hydrochromism upon changes in atmospheric relative humidity (RH), and reversible solid state photochromism upon generation of a cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cation. In this design strategy, the bipyridinium unit serves as both a water&#8208;sensitive receptor for the hydrochromic fluorophore&#8208;receptor system, and a photochromic group, capable of eliciting its own visible colorimetric response, generating a fluorescence quenching radical cation with prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. These dyes can be inkjet&#8208;printed onto cellulose paper or drop&#8208;cast as cellulose powder&#8208;based films and can be unidirectionally cycled between three different states which can be characteristically visualized under UV light or visible light. The material's photochromism, hydrochromism, and underlying mechanism of action was investigated using computational analysis, dynamic vapor sorption/desorption isotherms, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and variable humidity UV&#8208;Vis adsorption and fluorescence spectroscopies.

         <title>Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9398-9405, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large amount of Fe2+ was induced into Mn3O4 nanoparticles through effective electrodisplacement reaction to synthesize Mn3&#8722;xFeXO4 hollow nanostructures. By changing the addition of Fe2+, elemental compositions and structures of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 could be well adjusted. The remarkable performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures in pseudocapacitor applications is demonstrated. Compared with the original Mn3O4, the electrochemical performance of the obtained porous Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 nanostructure is significantly improved.







Abstract
Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn3&#8722;xFexO4 hollow nanostructure substantially enhanced comparing with pristine Mn3O4. Particularly, in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte, Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 with a typical diameter of 20&#8197;nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn0.16Fe2.84O4 and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 0.75&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.

         <title>Validation of Ab&#8208;Initio&#8208;Predicted Magnetic Anisotropies and Magneto&#8208;structural Correlations in Linear Hetero&#8208;trinuclear DyIII&#8208;NiII2 Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9372-9382, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discussed is a linear trinuclear DyIIINiII2 complex with a rare hexacoordinate DyIII center. The magnetic properties were studied experimentally by single crystal SQUID magnetometry, single crystal high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy. Parameters describing the ground state multiplet splitting have also been computed by ab&#8208;initio quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, and the large variety of experimental techniques allows for a thorough validation of the computational analysis.







Abstract
Reported are single crystal SQUID and single crystal high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR data of a trinuclear complex with a rare six&#8208;coordinate coordination sphere of a DyIII center coupled to two terminal six&#8208;coordinate NiII ions. The analysis of the single crystal spectroscopic parameters allows for an accurate description of the ground state wavefunction. The experimental analysis is supplemented by the analysis of the paramagnetic NMR spectra, allowing for a thorough description of the DyIII center. The experimental data are interpreted on the basis of an ab initio ligand field analysis, and the computed parameters are in good agreement with the experimental observations. This supports the quality of the theoretical approach based on a pseudo&#8208;spin Hamiltonian for the electronic ground state. Further support emerges from the ab initio ligand field theory based analysis of a structurally very similar system that, in contrast to the complex reported here, shows single molecule magnetic properties, and this is in agreement with the quantum&#8208;chemical prediction and analysis.

         <title>Tailored Mobility in a Zeolite Imidazolate Framework (ZIF) Antibody Conjugate**

Framing an assay: We present nanosized zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) conjugated to immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by using a strong and flexible covalent amino&#8208;alkyl link. These nanoZIF&#8208;IgG particles display good mobility and an excellent behaviour in dispersion. Their application to antibody&#8208;based bioanalytical assays, including enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), was examined.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) hybrid fluorescent nanoparticles and ZIF antibody conjugates have been synthesized, characterized, and employed in lateral&#8208;flow immunoassay (LFIA). The bright fluorescence of the conjugates and the possibility to tailor their mobility gives a huge potential for diagnostic assays. An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as label, proved the integrity, stability, and dispersibility of the antibody conjugates, LC&#8208;MS/MS provided evidence that a covalent link was established between these metal&#8208;organic frameworks and lysine residues in IgG antibodies.

         <title>Synthesis of Lignans Based on a Borate&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Cyclic Boranes</title>

Lignans are a kingdom of phytochemicals and have attracted much attention due to their structural variety and intriguing biological activities. Herein we report a unified synthetic approach to lignans that consisted of three phases: stereo&#8208;, substrate&#8208;, and skeletal&#8208;diversification. The approach was successfully applied to the syntheses of various lignans in a modular manner.







Abstract
Lignans are a group of polyphenolic phytochemicals that possess a large spectrum of chemical structures and biological activities. Here the syntheses of lignans &#8211; anwulignan, burseran, dehydroxycubebin, ruburisandrin B, and sesamin &#8211; are achieved based on a borate&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;fused bicyclic boranes, which were prepared by diastereoselective cyclic hydroboration of exo&#8208;cyclic diene with cyclopentyl&#8208; and thexylboranes, respectively. A one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of each cyclic borate with various aryl bromides initiated by activation of the cyclic borane with the carbon nucleophile provided 2,3&#8208;dibenzylbutane derivatives with different aromatic substituents. Finally, the syntheses of naturally occurring lignans were accomplished in several steps from the products of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.

Double (bond) take: The molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 has been realized in a rigid ultra&#8208;microporous metal organic framework that enabled efficient one&#8208;step C2H4 production from the binary gas mixture C2H2/C2H4 and the ternary gas mixture C2H2/CO2/C2H4.







Abstract
Rigid molecular sieving materials are the ideal candidates for gas separation (e.&#8201;g., C2H2/C2H4) due to their ultrahigh adsorption selectivity and the absence of gas co&#8208;adsorption. However, the absolute molecular sieving effect for C2H2/C2H4 separation has rarely been realized because of their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate the absolute molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 by a rigid ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8208;organic framework (F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu) with 1D regular channels (pore size of ca. 3.4&#8197;&#197;). F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu exhibited moderate acetylene uptake (35.5&#8197;cm3/cm3), but very low ethylene uptake (0.55&#8197;cm3/cm3) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, yielding the second highest C2H2/C2H4 uptake ratio of 63.6 up to now. One&#8208;step C2H4 production from a binary mixture of C2H2/C2H4 and a ternary mixture of C2H2/CO2/C2H4 at 298&#8197;K was achieved and verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Coupled with excellent thermal and water stability, F&#8722;PYMO&#8722;Cu could be a promising candidate for industrial C2 separation tasks.

         <title>Electrostatic Interactions Leading to Hierarchical Interpenetrating Electroconductive Networks in Silicon Anodes for Fast Lithium Storage</title>

Still going strong: A three&#8208;dimensional interpenetrating conductive framework composed of carbon nanotubes and MXene has been created through simple electrostatic self&#8208;assembly. It can connect silicon nanoparticles in series, thereby realizing rapid lithium&#8208;ion transmission of the electrodes. Moreover, the compound shows excellent cycle stability and a stable reversible capacity.







Abstract
Recently, the frequency of combining MXene, which has unique properties such as metal&#8208;level conductivity and large specific surface area, with silicon to achieve excellent electrochemical performance has increased considerably. There is no doubt that the introduction of MXene can improve the conductivity of silicon and the cycling stability of electrodes after elaborate structure design. However, most exhaustive contacts can only improve the electrode conductivity on the plane. Herein, a MXene@Si/CNTs (HIEN&#8208;MSC) composite with hierarchical interpenetrating electroconductive networks has been synthesized by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly. In this process, the CNTs are first combined with silicon nanoparticles and then assembled with MXene nanosheets. Inserting CNTs into silicon nanoparticles can not only reduce the latter&#8216;s agglomeration, but also immobilizes them on the three&#8208;dimensional conductive framework composed of CNTs and MXene nanosheets. Therefore, the HIEN&#8208;MSC electrode shows superior rate performance (high reversible capacity of 280&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8722;1 even tested at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), cycling stability (stable reversible capacity of 547&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and applicability (a high reversible capacity of 101&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles when assembled with NCM622 into a full cell). These results may provide new insights for other electrodes with excellent rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability.

         <title>An Ultrastable Crystalline Acylhydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water</title>

A new strategy for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;stable acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COFs through reinforcing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the adjacent layers with increased &#960;&#8208;surface is reported. It is surprising to found that the produced material exhibits extremely chemical stability in harsh environments, and could be used to effectively capture various organic micropollutants from water such as antibiotic and plastic components.







Abstract
As an important member of crystalline porous polymers, acylhydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained much attention in recent years. However, the low structural stability imparts a limit on their practical applications. To tackle this problem, we report a simple strategy to increase the chemical stability of acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COFs by incorporating azobenzene groups in the conjugated framework. Through reinforcing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the adjacent layers with increased &#960;&#8208;surface, it is surprising to find that the resulting materials exhibit extreme stability in harsh environments, such as in strong acid, strong base, aqueous educing agent and boiling water, even exposed to air for one year. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, such frameworks have been used to remove various organic micropollutants such as antibiotics, plastic components, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens from water with high capacity, fast speed and excellent reusability over a wide pH range at environmentally relevant concentrations. The results provide a new avenue to significantly enhance the stability of COFs for practical applications.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reactions of Osmanaphthalynes with PMe3 and H2O</title>

         <dc:description>
New classes of osmium complexes bearing different substituents have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method comprising ligand substitution and nucleophilic addition of osmanaphthalynes. Aided by DFT calculations, the possible mechanism of this experiment is discussed. Moreover, all the target complexes have been fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, HRMS and elemental analysis.







Abstract
Members of a new class of complexes, 2(CF3), 2(H), 2(Br), 2(I), and 2(OCH3), have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method involving the treatment of osmanaphthalynes bearing corresponding substituents (1(CF3), 1(H), 1(Br), 1(I), and 1(OCH3)) with trimethylphosphine (PMe3) and water. The main reaction process involves two steps, namely a ligand&#8208;exchange with trimethylphosphine and nucleophilic addition of water to the Os&#8801;C bond of the osmanaphthalyne. The substituents have a significant influence on the rate of the reaction, as befits a nucleophilic addition. Fortunately, the key intermediate [1(OCH3)]&#8242; could be successfully captured, and the detailed reaction mechanism has been explored with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which were in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. All of the target complexes have been fully characterized by 1H, 31P{1H}, and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Chiral Chromium Salen@rGO as Multipurpose and Recyclable Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>

A pyrene&#8208;tagged Cr&#8208;salen complex immobilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions at rGO surface delivers a robust, reusable, heterogeneous catalyst that is efficient in several asymmetric catalytic reactions. Highly enantioenriched compounds were produced and various valuable scalemic compounds were easily isolated in their pure form even when the catalyst was engaged in a multisubstrate procedure.







Abstract
The first immobilization of a pyrene&#8208;tagged chromium salen complex through &#960;&#8208;&#960; noncovalent interactions on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is described. A very robust supported catalytic system is obtained to promote asymmetric catalysis in repeated cycles, without loss of activity or enantioselectivity. This specific behavior was demonstrated in two different catalytic reactions (up to ten reuses) promoted by chromium salen complexes, the cyclohexene oxide ring&#8208;opening reaction and the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition between various aldehydes and Danishefsky's diene. Furthermore, the chiral chromium salen@rGO has been found to be compatible with a multi&#8208;substrate type use, in which the structure of the substrate involved is modified each time the catalyst is reused.

         <title>Scalable Production of Ambient Stable Hybrid Bismuth&#8208;Based Materials: AACVD of Phenethylammonium Bismuth Iodide Films**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9406-9413, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compact and stable bismuth halide&#8208;based hybrid material thin films were grown using aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. The dependence of structural and optoelectronic properties of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide films were evaluated on varying substrates, deposition temperatures and curing conditions. The morphology and optical band&#8208;bending effects were related to synthetic parameters, and crack&#8208;free films were obtained with high moisture resistance.







Abstract
Large homogeneous and adherent coatings of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide were produced using the cost&#8208;effective and scalable aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) methodology. The film morphology was found to depend on the deposition conditions and substrates, resulting in different optical properties to those reported from their spin&#8208;coated counterparts. Optoelectronic characterization revealed band bending effects occurring between the hybrid material and semiconducting substrates (TiO2 and FTO) due to heterojunction formation, and the optical bandgap of the hybrid material was calculated from UV&#8208;visible and PL spectrometry to be 2.05&#8197;eV. Maximum values for hydrophobicity and crystallographic preferential orientation were observed for films deposited on FTO/glass substrates, closely followed by values from films deposited on TiO2/glass substrates.

         <title>Reversible Vapochromic Luminescence Accompanied by Planar Half&#8208;Chair Conformational Change of a Propeller&#8208;Shaped Boron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
A propeller&#8208;shaped boron &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex exhibits a reversible color change of fluorescence originating from pseudopolymorphism. The emission color rapidly changes from green to blue when its pure crystals are exposed to an appropriate group of volatile organic compounds and vice versa. Such luminescent color changes are derived from crystal&#8211;crystal transitions accompanied by the planar&#8208;to&#8208;half&#8208;chair conformational changes of the complex. The small energy differences between the conformers of the complex can afford this pseudopolymorphic behavior.







Abstract
Leakage of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is one of the most severe industrial problems, because it can cause environmental pollution, global warming, fire, and explosion. Hence, the visualization of leakage is an essential technology to detect it at an early stage. Molecular crystals, fluorescence color of which can be changed by the exposure to VOCs could potentially serve as the sensing materials for realizing rapid and facile VOC detection. However, these materials usually require harsh conditions, such as heating or a vacuum, to recover their initial phases for reuse. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain completely reversible sensing systems without such energy&#8208;consuming recycling processes. Herein, the reversible color change of fluorescence from the crystals of a propeller&#8208;shaped boron &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex is reported. The complex was crystallized in distinct crystalline phases having different luminescent colors. Importantly, these phases were interconverted very rapidly (time constant &lt;60&#8197;s) and repeatedly upon exposure to the vapors of the appropriate VOCs. The small energy differences between conformers of the complex could lead to this pseudopolymorphic behavior. This finding could be applied for the development of further eco&#8208;friendly reversible sensing materials based on four&#8208;coordinated boron complexes.

         <title>Trifaceted Mickey Mouse Amphiphiles for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly, DNA Complexation and Organ&#8208;Selective Gene Delivery</title>

Mickey Mouse molecular nanoparticles with a trehalose&#8208;based cyclooligosaccharide core and uneven distributions of cationic (C, red lobules) and lipophilic patches (L, blue lobules) co&#8208;assemble with plasmid DNA (pDNA, orange chains) to afford transfectious nanacomplexes with programmable topologies and internal structures, ranging from multilamellar spheroids and rods to core&#8208;shell arrangements, translating into amazing cell efficiencies in&#8197;vitro and organ selectivities in&#8197;vivo with no need of targeting labels.







Abstract
Instilling segregated cationic and lipophilic domains with an angular disposition in a trehalose&#8208;based trifaceted macrocyclic scaffold allows engineering patchy molecular nanoparticles leveraging directional interactions that emulate those controlling self&#8208;assembling processes in viral capsids. The resulting trilobular amphiphilic derivatives, featuring a Mickey Mouse architecture, can electrostatically interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and further engage in hydrophobic contacts to promote condensation into transfectious nanocomplexes. Notably, the topology and internal structure of the cyclooligosaccharide/pDNA co&#8208;assemblies can be molded by fine&#8208;tuning the valency and characteristics of the cationic and lipophilic patches, which strongly impacts the transfection efficacy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Outstanding organ selectivities can then be programmed with no need of incorporating a biorecognizable motif in the formulation. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse nonviral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes by making cyclooligosaccharide patchiness the focus.

The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of a configurationally stable S&#8208;shaped double azahelicene&#8208;like molecule showing good chiroptical responses has been achieved with the high ee value of 89&#8201;% by the rhodium(I)/xyl&#8208;segphos&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed double [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a dicyanotetrayne.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of aza[6] and [7]helicene&#8208;like molecules have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyanodiynes. This protocol was successfully applied to the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of an S&#8208;shaped double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule with a high ee value of 89&#8201;%. Although no epimerization and racemization were observed in the double carbo[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule at 80&#8201;&#176;C, epimerization and racemization of the double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule proceeded at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule showed good fluorescent quantum yields and chiroptical responses under both neutral and acidic conditions.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9295-9301, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study on the amphiphilic peptides revealed unexpected effects of inserting an alkylene chain at the center on strengthening &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, providing stiffened hydrogels and diminishing cell adhesion property, which are clearly different from the effects of putting an alkyl tail at an end. This finding offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological functionalities of peptide materials.







Abstract
Amphiphilic peptides bearing terminal alkyl tails form supramolecular nanofibers that are increasingly used as biomaterials with multiple functionalities. Insertion of alkylene chains in peptides can be designed as another type of amphiphilic peptide, yet the influence of the internal alkylene chains on self&#8208;assembly and biological properties remains poorly defined. Unlike the terminal alkyl tails, the internal alkylene chains can affect not only the hydrophobicity but also the flexibility and packing of the peptides. Herein, we demonstrate the supramolecular and biological effects of the central alkylene chain length inserted in a peptide. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthened &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds and modulation of the packing order, and consequently the amphiphilic peptide bearing C2 alkylene chain formed a hydrogel with the highest stiffness. Interestingly, the amphiphilic peptides bearing internal alkylene chains longer than C2 showed a diminished cell&#8208;adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials.

         <title>Frontispiece: Organic Positive Materials for Magnesium Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium (Mg) is one of the popular elements on the earth which is more abundance, cheaper and safer for the users than lithium metal. In the combination with organic compounds (carbonyl&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and sulfur&#8208;based materials) as positive electrodes, the electrochemical system can be considered as a member of green chemistry. Moreover, this review will play a small role in reducing the environmental impact of the energy storage sector by avoiding the use of heavy metals or toxic elements. For more information, see the Review by N. A. Tran et&#8197;al. on page 9198.

         <dc:description>
Since two decades, tremendous progresses were made in gold chemistry. Most of them relate to the +I oxidation state which provides stable complexes with catalytic and pharmaceutical properties. Despite a more challenging chemistry, gold(III) complexes have recently attracted more and more attention as potential surrogates of gold(I) complexes. This is particularly true in the field of enantioselective catalysis, where the gold(III) complexes are expected to provide better asymmetric inductions. Read more about the syntheses and the applications of all well&#8208;defined chiral gold(III) complexes described during the last fifteen years in the Minireview by A. Blanc, P. de&#8197;Fr&#233;mont et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;9218&#8197;ff.

A tandem Nazarov/ene reaction in trienones was found to be initiated by tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPPB) and resulted in spiro compounds as single diastereoisomers. The reaction was applied to a set of substrates with different chain lengths and functionalities, and investigations on the mechanism were conducted. This novel diastereoselective reaction extends the application of interrupted Nazarov cyclizations as tools for the synthesis of natural products. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Kalesse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101041).

         <title>Cover Feature: Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers (Chem. Eur. J. 36/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of transient radical species are difficult to control, like the soap bubbles in the wind depicted in the cover image. Yet, these short&#8208;lived intermediates, when one encounters another, readily assemble into a united structure, as two bubbles fuse into a bigger single bubble. The enol silyl ether&#8208;derived radical cations with a highly acidic allylic proton facilitates the single&#8208;electron reduction of cyanopyridines via protonation. The resulting two radical intermediates successively engage in the radical&#8722;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Ooi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101352).

A vapochromic luminescent crystal consisting of boron diiminate has been discovered. The emission color is changed by absorption of solvent vapor, such as dichloromethane and recovered by desorption of encapsulated molecules through fuming with another solvent vapor, such as cyclohexane. The alteration of molecular conformation between planar and twisted structures is responsible for luminochromism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al.

Fiber&#8208;forming peptides are of high interest for potential biomedical applications. This work presents the unexpected effects of central alkylene chains in peptides on their self&#8208;assembly and biological properties. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthening of &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, formation of hydrogels with increased stiffness, thermal responses and significant decrease in the cell adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials by conformational flexibility.

Top hole! This minireview summarizes the design and synthesis challenges of porous WO3 including how the different synthesis methods affect its properties, morphology and application in different fields, such as supercapacitors, catalysts, sensors, and therapeutics. The porous tungsten oxide with thorough porous channels provides abundant active sites for surface reactions.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide (WO3) has received ever more attention and has been highly researched over the last decade due to its being a low&#8208;cost transition metal semiconductor with tunable, yet widely stable, band gaps. This minireview briefly highlights the challenges in the design and synthesis of porous WO3 including methods, precursors, solvent effects, crystal phases, and surface activities of the porous WO3 base material. These topics are explored while also drawing a connection of how the morphology and crystal phase affect the band gap. The shifts in band gap not only impact the optical properties of tungsten but also allow tuning to operate on different energy levels, which makes WO3 highly desirable in many applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysts, sensors, smart windows, and bioapplications.

         <title>Organic Positive Materials for Magnesium Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9198-9217, June 25, 2021. </description>

Mg cell is one of the promising candidate to replace to Li&#8208;ion batteries thanks to its advantages such as more abundance, cheaper and most importantly, the safety for the users. Positive electrode study is an important field in its development. Not only inorganic materials, but also the organic positive electrode research remains a major challenge to its potential use. Therefore, in this review, studies on organic positive electrodes in Mg batteries so far will be generalized.







Abstract
Magnesium batteries, like lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with higher abundance and similar efficiency, have drawn great interest for large&#8208;scale applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage and many more. On the other hand, the use of organic electrode materials allows high energy&#8208;performance, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, versatile, lightweight, and economically efficient magnesium storage devices. In particular, the structural diversity and the simple activity of organic molecules make redox properties, and hence battery efficiency, easy to monitor. While organic magnesium batteries still in their infancy, this field becomes more and more promising because significant results were reported. To summarize the achievements in studies on organic cathodes for magnesium systems, their synthesis is discussed, combined with electrode design to provide the basis for controlling the electrochemical properties. Moreover, the techniques to synthesize organic materials with high&#8208;yield are mentioned. Finally, potential problems and prospects are explored to further improve organic cathodes.

         <title>Chiral Gold(III) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9218-9240, June 25, 2021. </description>

Golden story: Recent progresses achieved in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined chiral gold(III) complexes have been summarized. Applications that encompass homogeneous catalysis, medicinal and material chemistry, are also described.







Abstract
Since the beginning of the 2000&#8217;s, homogeneous gold catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to promote the cyclization of unsaturated substrates with excellent regioselectivity allowing the synthesis of elaborated organic scaffolds. An important goal to achieve in gold catalysis is the possibility to induce enantioselective transformations by the assistance of chiral complexes. Unfortunately, the linear geometry of coordination for gold usually encountered in complexes at the +1 oxidation states renders this goal very challenging. In consequence, the interest toward the synthesis of chiral gold(III) complexes is steadily growing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Golden story&lt;/b&gt;: Recent progresses achieved in the synthesis of well-defined chiral gold(III) complexes have been summarized. Applications that encompass homogeneous catalysis, medicinal and material chemistry, are also described.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the 2000&#8217;s, homogeneous gold catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to promote the cyclization of unsaturated substrates with excellent regioselectivity allowing the synthesis of elaborated organic scaffolds. An important goal to achieve in gold catalysis is the possibility to induce enantioselective transformations by the assistance of chiral complexes. Unfortunately, the linear geometry of coordination for gold usually encountered in complexes at the +1 oxidation states renders this goal very challenging. In consequence, the interest toward the synthesis of chiral gold(III) complexes is steadily growing. Indeed, the square planar geometry of the gold(III) cation appears more suitable to promote chiral induction. Beside catalysis, gold(III) complexes have also shown promising potential in the field of pharmacology. Herein, syntheses and applications of well-defined gold(III) complexes reported over the last fifteen years are summarized.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>

The transient radical cations, generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation of enol silyl ethers by the excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst, can be exploited as Br&#248;nsted acids for the activation of cyanopyridines. The protonation allows facile single&#8208;electron reduction of the cyanopyridinium to generate radical intermediates and concomitantly converts the radical cations into nucleophilic allylic radicals to be engaged in the radical&#8208;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Low Pressure Carbonylation of Allylic Alcohols by Catalytic Anhydride Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9263-9266, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols is described for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure (10&#8197;bar). Key to high activities in the carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of anhydride activate the substrate.







Abstract
A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols has been realized for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure of CO (10&#8197;bar). The procedure is described in detail for the carbonylation of E&#8208;nerolidol, an important step in a new BASF&#8208;route to (&#8722;)&#8208;ambrox. Key to high activities in the allylic alcohol carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of carboxylic anhydride activate the substrate and are constantly regenerated with carbon monoxide under the reaction conditions. The identified reaction conditions are transferrable to other substrates as well.

Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a wide range of alkenols. This methodology allowed for the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide.







Abstract
Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a whole range of alkenols of different chain lengths linking the alkene and the alcohol, affording unsaturated aldehydes and ketones in moderate to good yields. In contrast, alkenyl triflates were not suitable partners for this reaction. This method allowed the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide, several of which retained key olfactory properties of the parent molecule.

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9257-9262, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations on Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations of trienones revealed a novel Nazarov cyclization/ene reaction tandem reaction. This reaction allows the stereoselective construction of quaternary spirocenters, with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl group acting as superb stereodirecting element. The produced spirocycles possess useful functionality for further modifications, making them potentially valuable synthetic intermediates.







Abstract
The different reactivity of trienones under Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids catalysis was investigated, resulting in distinct cyclization products and carbon backbones that originated either from a conjugate Prins cyclization or an interrupted Nazarov cyclization. In particular, an unprecedented Nazarov cyclization tandem reaction is presented, terminating the oxyallyl cation by an ene&#8208;type reaction, and leading stereoselectively to bicyclic spiro compounds. The terminal olefin of this motif represents a useful handle for further functionalization, making it a strategic intermediate in total syntheses. The tandem Nazarov/ene cyclization was shown to be preferred over a Nazarov/[3+2] tandem reaction for all our substrates, independent of chain length. Deuteration studies further support the mechanistic hypothesis of the terminating ene reaction.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Guanidine&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites with Strong Dichroism for Multiwavelength Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9267-9271, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskite, (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7, adopting the unique quantum&#8208;well structure, can be used for polarized&#8208;light detection. The polarization&#8208;sensitive detector based on (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7 single crystal achieves multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection with large dichroic ratios of &#8764;2.2, 1.29 and 1.23 for 520, 405 and 637&#8197;nm, respectively. This work shows that 2D hybrid perovskites hold great promise as materials for multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, benefiting from their natural anisotropy of quantum&#8208;well motifs and optical properties, have shown remarkable polarization&#8208;dependent responses superior to the 3D counterparts. Here, for the first time, multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive detectors were fabricated by using single crystals of a guanidine&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7 (where BA+ is n&#8208;butylammonium and GA+ is guanidium). Its unique 2D quantum&#8208;well structure results in strong crystallographic&#8208;dependence of optical absorption. Strikingly, our crystal&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a prominent photocurrent dichroic ratio (Imax/Imin) of &#8764;2.2 at 520&#8197;nm, higher than the typical 2D inorganic materials (GeSe, &#8764;1.09, PdSe2, &#8764;1.8). In addition, notable dichroic ratios of 1.29 and 1.23 at 405&#8197;nm and 637&#8197;nm are also created for the multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection. The prominent detecting performances, including low dark current (1.6&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;A), considerable on/off ratio (&#8764;2&#215;103), high photodetectivity (&#8764;3.3&#215;1011 Jones) and responsivity (&#8764;12.01&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1), make (BA)2(GA)Pb2I7 a promising candidate for polarized&#8208;light detection. This work sheds light on the rational engineering of new 2D hybrid perovskites for the high&#8208;performance optoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Carbo&#8208;mer of Barrelene: A Rigid 3D&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Expanded Molecular Barrel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9286-9291, June 25, 2021. </description>

After 1D (Z)&#8208;dimethylidynebutene, 2D benzene and 2D xylylene, carbo&#8208;meric expansion of 3D barrelene is envisaged. First examples of carbo&#8208;barrelenes have thus been obtained in 2&#8211;3 steps from classical substrates used for the synthesis of carbo&#8208;benzenes and carbo&#8208;xylylenes. Beyond experimental characterization by NMR/UV/Vis spectroscopy, voltammetry and crystallography, DFT&#8208;based theoretical analyses of carbo&#8208;barrelenes allow interpretation of their observed structural and electronic features and anticipation of their possible host capability toward ionic guests such as NH4+ or metallic ions.







Abstract
After extensive studies of 1D and 2D skeletal carbo&#8208;mers based on C8 &#960;&#8208;conjugating dialkynylbutatriene units (DABs: &#8764;C&#8801;C&#8722;(R)C=C=C=C(R)&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8764;) bridging sp or sp2 centers in carbo&#8208;butene, carbo&#8208;xylylene or carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives, 3D versions are envisaged through carbo&#8208;barrelenes and partially reduced derivatives thereof where two or three DAB blades span a bridge between sp3 carbinol vertices or ether thereof. For R=Ph, stable representatives were synthesized through a pivotal [6]pericyclynedione, and extensively characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical and crystallographic methods. Density functional theory calculations allow detailed analysis of structural and electronic features of the 7&#8197;&#197; high C26 barrel&#8208;shaped molecules, and show that they can behave as cages for ionic species. Beyond aesthetical concerns, the results could open prospects of applications in host&#8208;guest supramolecular chemistry and single molecule charge transport.

         <title>Synthesis of Stannylated Aryl Imines and Amines via Aryne Insertion Reactions into Sn&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 36, Page 9281-9285, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;stannylated anilines via aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion into Sn&#8722;N bonds is reported. Readily prepared stannylated imines were identified as suitable N&#8722;Sn&#8208;donors, offering the possibility to modify both introduced substituents in follow up reactions using the rich Sn&#8208;chemistry and deprotection of the imine.







Abstract
The reaction of in&#8197;situ generated arynes with stannylated imines to provide ortho&#8208;stannyl&#8208;aniline derivatives is reported. The readily prepared trimethylstannyl benzophenone imine is introduced as an efficient reagent to realize the aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion reaction. The imine functionality is an established N&#8208;protecting group and insertions proceed with good yields and good to excellent regioselectivities. The product anilines are valuable starting materials for follow&#8208;up chemistry thanks to the rich chemistry offered by the trimethylstannyl moiety.

A direct and efficient asymmetric synthesis of phenylamino&#8208;3&#8208;indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones was realized by developing a chiral nickel complex catalytic system for the amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines. A wide range of 3&#8208;aminooxindoles with 3&#8208;alkyl or 3&#8208;aryl substitution, including key intermediates of bioactive molecules, was created in excellent yield and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;nickel(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines has been developed. A series of alkyl or aryl 3&#8208;amino&#8208;indolinones with quaternary stereocenters were obtained in high yields with excellent ee values in one step (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 96&#8201;% ee). The method provided a ready route to optically active intermediates of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;based bioactive compounds. Moreover, a possible transition&#8208;state model is proposed so as to elucidate the origin of the chirality based on the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the catalyst and the adduct.

A series of alkyl or aryl 3-amino-indolinones with quaternary stereocenters were obtained in high yields with excellent &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; values in one step (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 96&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The method provided a ready route to optically active intermediates of 3-amino-2-oxindole-based bioactive compounds. Moreover, a possible transition-state model is proposed so as to elucidate the origin of the chirality based on the X-ray crystal structure of the catalyst and the adduct.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Suppressing Dehydroisomerization Boosts n&#8208;Butane Dehydrogenation with High Butadiene Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of alkaline&#8208;earth metals into Pt&#8208;Ga2O3 catalyst can significantly suppress the dehydroisomerization and coke deposition during n&#8208;butane dehydrogenation, increase the Pt dispersity and stabilize Pt atoms at high temperature. Consequently, the optimal catalyst of 0.1Pt6Mg2Ga/S10 displays a n&#8208;butane conversion of 82.1&#8201;% at a butadiene selectivity of 34.7&#8201;% at 625&#8201;&#176;C, which has outperformed the reported catalysts for n&#8208;butane dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Butadiene (BD) is a critical raw material in chemical industry, which is conventionally produced from naphtha cracking. The fast&#8208;growing demand of BD and the limited oil reserve motivate chemists to develop alternative methods for BD production. Shale gas, which mainly consists of light alkanes, has been considered as cheap raw materials to replace oil for BD production via n&#8208;butane direct dehydrogenation (n&#8208;BDH). However, the quest for highly&#8208;efficient catalysts for n&#8208;BDH is driven by the current drawback of low BD selectivity. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for boosting the selectivity of BD by suppressing dehydroisomerization, an inevitable step in the conventional n&#8208;BDH process which largely reduces the selectivity of BD. Detailed investigations show that the addition of alkali&#8208;earth metals (e.&#8201;g., Mg and Ca) into Pt&#8208;Ga2O3/S10 catalysts increases Pt dispersity, suppresses coke deposition and dehydroisomerization, and thus leads to the significant increase of BD selectivity. The optimized catalyst displays an initial BD selectivity of 34.7&#8201;% at a n&#8208;butane conversion of 82.1&#8201;% at 625&#8201;&#176;C, which outperforms the reported catalysts in literatures. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for BD production via n&#8208;BDH, but also promotes the researches on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Starburst Donor&#8208;Acceptor Triphenylamine Derivatives and Their Application as Ratiometric Luminescent Molecular Thermometers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From each his own: As the configuration of the central biphenyl breaks up any &#960;&#8208;conjugation, the triarylamine arms of these simple molecules retain their intrinsic electronic properties. This facilitates fluorescence from the individual subchromophoric units across the entire visible spectrum, generating white light. The excited&#8208;state process can be modulated by external stimuli such as temperature; thus, the compound could be exploited as molecular thermometers.







Abstract
White&#8208;light emission (WLE) from a single molecule is a highly desirable alternative to a complex mixture of complementary colour emitters, which suffers from poor stability and reproducibility for potential use in organic electronic devices and lighting applications. We report single&#8208;molecule WLE both in solution and thin films by judiciously controlled &#960;&#8208;electron delocalisation between the triarylamine subchromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) forms the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron&#8208;rich donors triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration of the TPA core and the other donors renders the &#960;&#8208;conjugation across the entire chromophore poor, thus the individual subchromophoric units retain their individual emission characteristics, which cover all three primary colour emissions, that is, red, green and blue (RGB). TPA&#8722;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green&#8208;red region originating from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in lifetime, have a linear relationship with temperature between 180&#8211;330&#8197;K, thus the molecules can function as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19&#8197;K&#8722;1 in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with a spectral shift of 0.3&#8197;nm&#8201;K&#8722;1 and their workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications. At lower temperatures, individual subchromophoric properties subside because of the reduced dihedral angle of biphenyl, and fluorescence from the whole molecule becomes dominant.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From each his own&lt;/b&gt;: As the configuration of the central biphenyl breaks up any &#960;-conjugation, the triarylamine arms of these simple molecules retain their intrinsic electronic properties. This facilitates fluorescence from the individual subchromophoric units across the entire visible spectrum, generating white light. The excited-state process can be modulated by external stimuli such as temperature; thus, the compound could be exploited as molecular thermometers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White-light emission (WLE) from a single molecule is a highly desirable alternative to a complex mixture of complementary colour emitters, which suffers from poor stability and reproducibility for potential use in organic electronic devices and lighting applications. We report single-molecule WLE both in solution and thin films by judiciously controlled &#960;-electron delocalisation between the triarylamine subchromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) forms the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron-deficient acceptor 3-ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron-rich donors triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration of the TPA core and the other donors renders the &#960;-conjugation across the entire chromophore poor, thus the individual subchromophoric units retain their individual emission characteristics, which cover all three primary colour emissions, that is, red, green and blue (RGB). TPA&#8722;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green-red region originating from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in lifetime, have a linear relationship with temperature between 180&#8211;330&#8197;K, thus the molecules can function as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19&#8197;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with a spectral shift of 0.3&#8197;nm&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and their workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications. At lower temperatures, individual subchromophoric properties subside because of the reduced dihedral angle of biphenyl, and fluorescence from the whole molecule becomes dominant.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by crystal structure prediction, a &#8220;templating&#8221; strategy was used to construct selective binding sites in a trianglimine macrocycle crystal for ethyl acetate, an important chemical raw material and solvent. The resulting molecular crystals exhibit inherently high selectivity towards ethyl acetate, and hence can separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol. The crystals show reasonable adsorption kinetics, good reliability after multiple adsorption cycles, and hold promise for practical separation or detection applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G.&#8197;M. Day, M. Liu, A.&#8197;I. Cooper, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101510).

         <title>An NHC&#8208;Stabilised Phosphinidene for Catalytic Formylation: A DFT&#8208;Guided Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a low&#8208;valent phosphorus compound to the arena of catalysis: A N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene (1) was used for the activation of CO2. DFT calculations showed that the nucleophilicity of the phosphorus centre and a noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the phenyl rings of phenylsilane and the catalyst synergistically drive the formylation of primary amides by CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
In recent years, the applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds have gained momentum in the field of catalysis. Owing to the accessibility of two lone pairs of electrons, NHC&#8208;stabilised phosphinidenes have been found to be excellent Lewis bases; however, they cannot yet be used as catalysts. Herein, an NHC&#8208;stabilised phosphinidene, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H imidazole (1), for the activation of CO2 is reported.A closer inspection of the CO2 activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis shows that phosphinidene is associated with phenylsilane through a noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8722;H bond facilitating hydride transfer to the CO2 molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO2 activation and its catalytic reductive functionalisation leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted to Certain Live Cells Based on the Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;Cell Affinity of G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure topologies, we elaborately designed a whole set of DNA basic logic gates. More significantly, by further using the selective affinity between aptamer G4 and its targeted cancer cells, a spatially restricted cellular INHIBIT logic gate was successfully achieved, whose operational sites can be restricted to specific live cells.







Abstract
DNA computation is considered a fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers; it has evoked substantial attention and made rapid advances. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially at the cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, a series of DNA logic gates was designed by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further using the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, an INHIBIT logic gate has been realized whose operational site is precisely restricted to specific live cells. The design strategy might have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene: Synthesis, Characterization and Application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let there be light: A &#960;&#8208;extended, fully conjugated antiaromatic azatrioxa[8]circulene&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure has been prepared, fully characterized and used in as the emitter in brightly emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), inverted organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (IOLEDs) and quantum light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs).







Abstract
A soluble, green&#8208;blue fluorescent, &#960;&#8208;extended azatrioxa[8]circulene was synthesized by oxidative condensation of a 3,6&#8208;dihydroxycarbazole and 1,4&#8208;anthraquinone by using benzofuran scaffolding. This is the first circulene to incorporate anthracene within its carbon framework. Solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and bright green electroluminescence accompanied by excimer emission are the key optical properties of this material. The presence of sliding &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the single crystal of dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene is found to cause a very high electron&#8208;hopping rate, thus making this material a promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an electron mobility predicted to be around 2.26&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The best organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device based on the dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene fluorescent emitter has a brightness of around 16&#8201;000&#8197;Cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 3.3&#8201;%. Quantum dot&#8208;based OLEDs were fabricated by using dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene as a host matrix material.

         <title>&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Trapping of Multiple Transient Azolyllithiums in Batch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums via a halogen &#8216;dance&#8217; was realized in a batch reactor. This method allows selective generation of isomeric azolylzinc species from a single starting material using newly synthesized bench&#8208;stable zinc halide diamine complexes, leading to the divergent and stereoselective synthesis of functionalized azoles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Okano et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101256).

Varying both chromophores enables different communication pathways between the chromophores, exploiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and energy transfer (ET) properties, and thus, furnishing aggregation&#8208;based fluorescence switches.

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20 % and 44 % in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease&#8208;relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42 %. The introduced principle will enable new applications where temporal or spatiotemporal control of an RNA&#8208;targeting mechanism is desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Germyliumylidene: A Versatile Low Valent Group 14 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes [RGe(NHC)2]+ are typically Lewis basic (LB) in nature, owing to their lone pair and coordination of two NHCs to the vacant p&#8208;orbitals of the germanium atom. However, they can also show Lewis acidity (LA) via Ge&#8208;CNHC&#963;* orbital. Utilizing this unique electronic feature, we report the first example of bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene [MesTerGe(NHC)2]Cl (1), (MesTer= 2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3; NHC= IMe4 = 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) catalyzed reduction of CO2 with amines and silane, which proceeds via its Lewis basic nature. In contrast, the Lewis acid nature of 1 is utilized in the catalyzed hydroboration and cyanosilylation of carbonyls. Thus, highlighting the versatile ambiphilic nature of bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating by molecular design the enantiodiscrimination features of inherently chiral selectors: a HPLC and voltammetry study case with atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208; biindole based monomers and oligomer films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is introduced and studied in cascade in two enantioselection contests. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Resolution of Spin&#8208;Crossover Active Iron(II) [2x2] Grid Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral magnetic materials are proposed for applications in second&#8208;order non&#8208;linear optics, magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism, among others. Recently, we have reported a set of tetra&#8208;nuclear Fe(II) grid complex conformers with general formula C/S&#8208;[Fe  4  L  4  ]  8+  (L: 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole). In the grid complexes, isomerism emerges from tautomerism and conformational isomerism of the ligand L, and the S&#8208;type grid complex is chiral, which originates from different non&#8208;centrosymmetric spatial organization of the trans type ligand around the Fe(II) center. However, the selective preparation of an enantiomerically pure grid complex in a controlled manner is difficult due to spontaneous self&#8208;assembly. To achieve the pre&#8208;synthesis programmable resolution of Fe(II) grid complexes, we designed and synthesized two novel intrinsically chiral ligands by appending chiral moieties to the parent ligand. The complexation of these chiral ligands with Fe(II) salt resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure Fe(II) grid complexes, as unambiguously elucidated by CD and XRD studies. The enantiomeric complexes exhibited similar gradual and half&#8208;complete thermal and photo&#8208;induced SCO characteristics. The good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated CD spectra further supports the enantiomeric purity of the complexes and even the magnetic studies. The chiral resolution of Fe(II)&#8208; [2x2] grid complexes reported in this study, for the first time, might enable the fabrication of magneto&#8208;chiral molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Promotion of Proton Conductivity by Encapsulation Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra in Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successively to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has the size of  ca.  20 &#197; (diameter), lager than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14 &#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7 &#197;), which makes that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOFs&#8217; cavities. The incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  S cm  &#8208;1  (at 80&#176;C under 98% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#204;DUT&#8208;68 which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 are more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Zr-based metal-organic polyhedra (MOP) was self-assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT-68, successively to synthesize MOP-1@DUT-68. The MOP guest (MOP-1) has the size of  ca.  20 &#197; (diameter), lager than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14 &#197;) of DUT-68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7 &#197;), which makes that the migration and leaching of MOP-1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP-1 is encapsulated in the MOFs&#8217; cavities. The incorporation of MOP-1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP-1@DUT-68 reach 1.14 &#215; 10  -3  S cm  -1  (at 80&#176;C under 98% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT-68. Compared with MOP-1&#204;DUT-68 which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP-1@DUT-68 are more prone to form faster proton-conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;helical array of the aromatic oligoamide sequences can be switched from the antiparallel to parallel pattern through the transformation of thiol to disulfide. This enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias.







Abstract
A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the P/M bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This change enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness&#8208;mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.

         <title>Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Mono&#8208; and Bimetallic Lanthanide Tetraimido&#8208;Sulfate S(NtBu)42&#8722; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of isomorphous lanthanide Gd to Er complexes containing the tetraimido sulfate ligand renders these compounds compelling to be investigated for their single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The displayed Dy dimer shows slow magnetic relaxation at zero field. The monomeric Tb and Dy complexes show field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour. The ligand holds great potential for higher blocking systems, that is, removal of chloride ions, lithium transmetalation and promotion of the magnetic communication between the metal ions.







Abstract
Lanthanide ions are particularly well&#8208;suited for the design of single&#8208;molecule magnets owing to their large unquenched orbital angular momentum and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling that gives rise to high magnetic anisotropy. Such nanoscopic bar magnets can potentially revolutionize high&#8208;density information storage and processing technologies, if blocking temperatures can be increased substantially. Exploring non&#8208;classical ligand scaffolds with the aim to boost the barriers to spin&#8208;relaxation are prerequisite. Here, the synthesis, crystallographic and magnetic characterization of a series of each isomorphous mono&#8208; and dinuclear lanthanide (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er) complexes comprising tetraimido sulfate ligands are presented. The dinuclear Dy complex [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2DyCl2}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClLi(thf)2] (1c) shows true signatures of single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior in the absence of a dc field. In addition, the mononuclear Dy and Tb complexes [{(thf)2Li(NtBu)2S(tBuN)2LnCl2(thf)2] (2b,c) show slow magnetic relaxation under applied dc fields.

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol Derivatives and the Lewis Amphoteric Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate Anion, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species are virtually unknown, the oxidation of tris(pentafluoroethyl)silane, Si(C2F5)3H, with NO2 yielding tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol 1 which readily condenses to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane is reported. Deprotonation of in&#8197;situ generated Si(C2F5)3OH leads to hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate 3 showing the Lewis amphoteric character of [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;.







Abstract
While alkyl&#8208;substituted siloxanes are widely known, virtually nothing is known about perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species, the silanols and silanolates. We recently reported on the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide ion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, which features Lewis amphoteric character deriving from the pentafluoroethyl substituents and their strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Transferring this knowledge, we investigated the Lewis amphoteric behavior of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;. In order to examine such Lewis amphoteric behavior, we first developed a strategy for the synthesis of the corresponding silanol Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses at room temperature to the hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disiloxane, (C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3. Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3OH employing a sterically demanding phosphazene base allows the characterization of the first example of a dimeric triorganosilanolate: the dianionic hexakis(pentafluoroethyl)disilanolate, [{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722;, implies Lewis amphoteric character of the monomeric [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722; anion.

         <title>PorphyStruct: A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supersaddled copper corroles are a result of structural investigations towards non&#8208;planar distortion modes of porphyrinoids performed by the new digital tool PorphyStruct. The program introduces the technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter.







Abstract
PorphyStruct, a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in&#8208;depths discussions of structure&#8208;function correlations.

         <title>Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Semi&#8208;flexible Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Low Frequency and Small Amplitude Mechanical Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six types of polyoxometalates (POMs) with different structures and compositions are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs can promote the transfer of electrons from semiconductors to metals, laying a foundation for the application of POMs in a new field. and providing a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is essential for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Many organic polymer friction materials used widely have thermal stability problems, which makes TENGs with semiconductors as friction materials stand out. Here, we report a semi&#8208;flexible TENG based on metal and TiO2 modified by polyoxometalates (POMs) as pure inorganic friction materials. Six different POMs are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of TENGs, and the output performance of TENGs with different POMs&#8208;modified semiconductors and different metals as friction materials are tested. Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the optimal Ag&#8208;K6P2Mo18O62(P2Mo18)/TiO2 TENG device is increased by more than 4 times, which is mainly attributed to the strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs. This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.

         <title>BODIPYs with Photoactivatable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivatable BODIPYs permit fluorescence switching with spatiotemporal control under the influence of optical stimulations. Their synthetic versatility further provides the opportunity to engineer the photochemical, photophysical and structural properties for the implementation of invaluable imaging strategies aimed at elucidating the structures and dynamics of biological samples. Specifically, these photoactivatable fluorophores allow the visualization of live cells with sub&#8208;diffraction resolution and the monitoring of dynamic events in live organisms.







Abstract
The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, but efficient: Inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the tBu2S ligand is exploited to obtain molecular precursors that decompose at low&#8208; or even room temperature to afford metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. Easily extendable to other systems, this strategy can be used to obtain metastable or compositionally complex nanomaterials with greater control and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to harsh conditions.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(tBu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(tBu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(tBu2S)] (3) (TFA=trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.&#8201;g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5, Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.

         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium battery attracts lots of attention because of its high safety and low cost compared to lithium battery, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn  2  O  4  is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  . The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn  3+  (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe  3+  (non Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of a&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as a&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetallation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetallation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8211;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. Using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI  2  (IMe)  4  ] (Ln = Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] (M = Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetallation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI  2  (IMes)(THF)  3  ] while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI  2  (THF)  4  ] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI  2  (IMe)  4  ]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both complexes are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which may lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, we developed a light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into achieve selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus to induce the thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. We also demonstrate the Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo, which can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control cytotoxicity activation at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C &#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.</dc:description>

A room temperature, visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and redox neutral direct C&#8208;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance allow the preparation of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.</dc:description>

All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Iod(az)olium Salts &#8211; Potent Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the application of  N  &#8208;heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB&#8208;donors in halogen&#8208;bond catalysis.

N  &#8208;Methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB&#8208;donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF  3  .</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article describes the application of  N  -heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono- and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB-donors in halogen-bond catalysis. They were benchmarked in seven diverse test reactions in which the activation of carbon- and metal-chloride bonds as well as carbonyl and nitro groups was achieved.  N  -Methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB-donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF  3  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T  1  &#8208;weighted MR images.</dc:description>

         <title>"Zn bridge" Effect Toward Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristic For Volatile Random Access Memory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyimide memory materials with D&#8208;A structure based on charge transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next generation of information storage technology due to its outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance, well dimensional and chemical stability. It is one of core challenges in this field to precisely control memory performance by limited chemical decoration. Most of reported work mainly focus on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for expected memory behaviour of polyimides, which take a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we reported a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8208;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in central core of porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of charge transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8208;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance via only altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered cyclotides with potent broad in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to bioterrorism and rapid drug resistance development to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, we report the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity and provided protection in vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the  N  &#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example on the direct C&#8208;6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8208;H group.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Initiated Cobalt Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Outer&#8208;sphere radical hydrogenation of olefins proceeds via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from transition metal hydride species to the substrate. Typical catalysts exhibit M&#8211;H bonds that are either too weak to efficiently activate H  2  &#160;or too strong to reduce unactivated olefins. This contribution evaluates an alternative approach, that starts from a square&#8208;planar cobalt(II) hydride complex. Photoactivation results in Co&#8211;H bond homolysis. The three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) photoproduct binds H  2  &#160;to give a dihydrogen complex, which is a strong hydrogen atom donor, enabling the stepwise hydrogenation of both styrenes and unactivated aliphatic olefins with H  2  &#160;via HAT.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions show a remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8208;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tunning its reactivity. Here, we describe the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions. We use DFT&#8208;derived parameters for capturing their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic carbon, the number of &#945;&#8208;boryl motifs, and the metal counteraction. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata&#8208;alkene species with C&#8208;B &#960; interaction polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, we can classify the &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1) nucleophilic borata&#8208;alkene salts with alkali and alkali&#8208;earth metals, 2) nucleophilic &#951;  2  &#8208;(C&#8208;B) borata&#8208;alkene complexes with early transition metals, Cu and Ag, and 3) &#945;&#8208;boryl alkyl complexes with late transition metals. This trend map aids the selection of the appropriate reactive synthon depending on the sought reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tunable, Redox Active Octapalladium Chains Supported by Linear Tetraphosphines, Leading to Dynamically 1D Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of Pd8 chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L = none (1), solvents (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]&#173;(BF4)2 (4), were systematically synthesized by using 2a (L = CH3CN) as a good precursor. DFT calculations with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (D3) indicated that the formation energy of Pd8 chain from two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions with four sets of interligand C&#8211;H/p interactions and Pd&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared delocalized covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands, which are evidenced by the relationships between the NIR absorption energy and the distances of the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2]2+ (13), and their cyclic voltammograms demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+ &#8596; {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. Reactions of 2a with 1 eq. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, DOSY NMR spectra and SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers exist as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50 units of the Pd8 rod.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of a nickel&#8208;porphyrin derivative (Ni&#8208;DPPyP) containing two pyridyl coordinating sites and two pentyl chains at trans  meso  positions was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) on Au(111). Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl&#8217;s nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423 K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) are formyl&#8208;containing nucleosides that are created by oxidative stress in differentiated cells. While fdU is almost exclusively an oxidative stress lesion formed from deoxythymidine (T), the situation for fdC is more complex. Next to formation as an oxidative lesion, it is particularly abundant in stem cells, where it is more frequently formed in an epigenetically important oxidation reaction performed by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent TET enzymes from 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC). Recently, it was shown that genomic fdC and fdU can react with the &#949;&#8208;aminogroups of nucleosomal lysines to give Schiff base adducts that covalently link nucleosomes to genomic DNA. Here we show that fdU features a significantly higher reactivity towards lysine side chains compared with fdC. This result shows that depending on the amounts of fdC and fdU, oxidative stress may have a bigger impact on nucleosome binding than epigenetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Surface Behavior of NDI&#8208;Chromophores Mounted on a Tripodal Scaffold: Towards Self&#8208;Decoupled Chromophores for Single Molecule Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the efficient synthesis, the absorption and the emission spectra and the electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetra&#173;carbox&#173;di&#173;imide (NDI) tripodal molecules comprising thioacetate anchors for their surface investigations. Our studies showed that particularly pyrrolidinyl group with strong electron&#8208;donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core&#8208;substituted NDI chromophore and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94 eV. The redox properties of NDIs are influenced by core substituents as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. The strong electron donating character of pyrrolidine substituents results in relatively high HOMO and LUMO levels of &#8208;5.31 and &#8208;3.37 eV when compared with the parental unsubstituted NDI. UHV&#8208;STM measurements of a submonolayer of the rigid tripodal NDI chromophores deposited on Au(111) by spray deposition show that these molecules mainly tend to adsorb flat in a pairwise fashion on the surface and form unordered films. However, the STML experiments also reveal a few molecular clusters, which might consist of upright oriented molecules protruding from the molecular island and show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields of up to 6&#215;10  &#8208;3  . These results demonstrate the promising potential of the NDI tripodal chromophores for the fabrication of molecular devices profiting from optical features of the molecular layer.</dc:description>

Our studies showed that particularly pyrrolidinyl group with strong electron-donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core-substituted NDI chromophore and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94 eV. The redox properties of NDIs are influenced by core substituents as revealed by cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>The Binding Pocket at the Interface of Multimeric Telomere G&#8208;quadruplexes: Myth or Reality?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human telomeric DNA with hundreds of repeats of the 5&#8217;&#8208;TTAGGG&#8208;3&#8217; motif plays a crucial role in several biological processes. It folds into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures and features a pocket at the interface of two contiguous G4 blocks. Up to now no structural NMR and crystallographic data are available for ligands interacting with contiguous G4s. We investigated naphthalene diimide monomers and dyads as ligands of a dimeric G4 of human telomeric DNA comparing the results with those of the model monomeric G4. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling were used to elucidate binding features. Ligand fluorescence lifetime and induced circular dichroism unveiled occupancy of the binding site at the interface. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the hypothesis as they remarkably change for the dyad complexes of the monomeric and dimeric telomeric G4. The bi&#8208;functional ligand structure of the dyads is a fundamental requisite for binding at the G4 interface as only the dyads engage in complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry, lodging in the pocket at the interface and establishing multiple interactions with the DNA skeleton. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data, our study affords important proofs of binding at the interface pocket and clues on the role played by the ligand structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A chiral lanthanide tag for stable and rigid attachment to single cysteine residues in proteins for NMR, EPR and time&#8208;resolved luminescence studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lanthanide&#8208;binding tag site&#8208;specifically attached to a protein presents a tool to probe the protein by multiple spectroscopic techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy experiments. Here we present a new stable chiral Ln(III) tag, referred to as C12, for spontaneous and quantitative reaction with a cysteine residue generating a stable thioether bond. The synthetic protocol of the tag is relatively straightforward and the tag is stable for storage and shipping. It displays greatly enhanced reactivity towards selenocysteine, opening a route towards selective tagging of selenocysteine in proteins containing cysteine residues. Loaded with Tb(III) or Tm(III) ions, the C12 tag readily generates pseudocontact shifts (PCS) in protein NMR spectra. It produces a relatively rigid tether between lanthanide and protein, which is beneficial for interpretation of the PCSs by single magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensors, and it is suitable for measuring distance distributions in double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER) experiments. Upon reaction with cysteine or other thiol compounds, the Tb(III) complex exhibits a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence quantum yield, affording a highly sensitive turn&#8208;on luminescence probe for time&#8208;resolved FRET assays and enzyme reaction monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex formation by DNA sequences deficient in guanines: Two tetrad parallel quadruplexes do not fold intramolecularly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical forms of nucleic acids which are frequently found in genomes. The stability of G4s depends, among other factors, on the number of G&#8208;tetrads. Three&#8208; or four&#8208;tetrad G4s and antiparallel two&#8208;tetrad G4s have been characterized experimentally; however, the existence of an intramolecular (i.e., not dimeric or multimeric) two&#8208;tetrad parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G4 has never been experimentally observed. Many sequences compatible with two&#8208;tetrad G4 can be found in important genomic regions such as promoters, for which parallel G4s predominate. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, we study the propensity of the model sequence AATGGGTGGGTTTGGGTGGGTAA to form an intramolecular parallel&#8208;stranded G4 upon increasing the number of GGG&#8208;to&#8208;GG substitutions. Deletion of a single G leads to the formation of intramolecular G4s with a stacked G&#8208;triad, whose topology depends on the location of the deletion. Removal of another guanine from another G&#8208;tract leads to bi&#8208; or multi&#8208;meric G4s. Further deletions mostly prevent formation of any stable G4. Thus, a solitary two&#8208;tetrad parallel DNA G4 is not thermodynamically stable and requires additional interactions through some capping residues. However, transiently populated metastable two&#8208;tetrad species can associate to form stable dimers, the dynamic formation of which may play additional delicate roles in gene regulation. These findings provide essential information for bioinformatics studies searching for potential G4s in genomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitric Oxide Photoreleasers with Fluorescent Reporting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology and its controlled delivery has great prospect in therapeutic applications. &#160;The light&#8208;activated NO uncaging from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of the easy and real&#8208;time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in cell environment. In this contribution, we seek to provide an overview of the advances in photoactivatable NO releasers bearing fluorescent reporting functionalities achieved in our and other laboratories, highlighting the rationale design and their potential therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerization of allenes using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst to generate high Mn polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co&#8208;catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to  M  n  = 189 000 Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically we postulate that the co&#8208;catalyst does not form an iron(II) hydride  in situ  , but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclobutane side&#8208;product is also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolated aromatic molecules is described via an auxiliary&#8208;assisted, palladium catalyzed, C&#8208;H bonds functionalization with trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as reagent. The mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;products can be preferentially formed. Some mechanistic investigations were realized to better understand the reaction. This methodology was also extended to fluoroalkylselenyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite with Significantly Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered as a green metallic corrosion protection technology, which uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials. A CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared in this work, and its photoelectrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO 3  has a well band matching with CdIn 2  S 4  , leading to a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical CP performance of the CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn 2  S 4  /WO 3  nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination by intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of W element, and it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals. This research will promote the practical application process of the photoelectrochemical CP technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;Dipyrrin: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Assemblies and Slow Magnetic Relaxation of the Cobalt(II) Complex in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin (  Janus&#8208;PPAD  ) with Janus duality was synthesized by a Schiff base forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole. The orthogonal interactions of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties in  Janus&#8208;PPAD  enabled arrangement of metal ions at regular intervals: zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination provided metal&#8208;coordinated  Janus&#8208;PPAD  dimers, which can subsequently form hydrogen&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional arrays both in solution and in the solid state. The supramolecular assembly formation of the zinc(II) complex in solution was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on the isodesmic model, in which a binding constant for the elongation of assemblies is constant. In the solid state, owing to the tetrahedral coordination, the cobalt(II) complex exhibited a slow magnetic relaxation due to the negative  D  value of &#8722;27.1 cm  &#8722;1  with the effective relaxation energy barrier  U  eff  &#160;of 38.0 cm  &#8211;1  . The effect of magnetic dilution on the relaxation behavior is discussed. The relaxation mechanism in the low temperature range was analyzed by considering spin lattice interactions and quantum tunneling effects. The easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy was confirmed, and the relevant wave functions were obtained by ab initio CASSCF calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding Insights into Quadruplex Selective Carbazole Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary DNA structures have received increasing attention in medicinal chemistry owing to their key involvement in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere length homeostasis and transcription of important proto&#8208;oncogenes. Different classes of G4 ligands have been developed for the potential treatment of several human diseases. Among them, the carbazole scaffold with appropriate side chain appendages has attracted much interest for designing G4 ligands. Because of its large and rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugation system and ease of functionalization at three different positions, a variety of carbazole derivatives have been synthesized from various natural or synthetic sources for potential applications in G4&#8208;based therapeutics and biosensors. Herein, we provide an updated close&#8208;up of the literatures on carbazole&#8208;based G4 ligands with particular focus given on their detailed binding insights studied by NMR spectroscopy. The structure&#8208;activity relationships and the opportunities and challenges of their potential applications as biosensors and therapeutics are also discussed. This review will provide an overall picture of carbazole ligands with remarkable G4 topological preference, fluorescence properties and significant bioactivity; portraying carbazole as a very promising scaffold for assembling G4 ligands with a range of novel functional applications.</dc:description>
