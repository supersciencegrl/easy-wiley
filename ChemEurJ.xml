         <title>Coumarin C&#8211;H Functionalization by Mn(I) Carbonyls: Mechanistic Insight by Ultra&#8208;Fast IR Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn(I) C&#8211;H functionalization of coumarins provides a versatile and practical method for the rapid assembly of fused polycyclic pyridinium&#8208;containing coumarins in a regioselective manner. The synthetic strategy enables application of bench&#8208;stable organomanganese reagents in both photochemical&#8208; and thermal &#8208;promoted reactions. The cyclomanganated intermediates, and global reaction system, provide an ideal testing ground for structural characterization of the active Mn(I) carbonyl&#8208;containing species, including transient species observable by ultra&#8208;fast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. The thermodynamic reductive elimination product, solely encountered from reaction between alkynes and air&#8208;stable organometallic cyclomanganated coumarins, has enabled characterization of a critical seven&#8208;membered Mn(I) intermediate, detected by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy, enabling the elucidation of the temporal profile of key steps in the reductive elimination pathway. Quantitative data are provided. Managanated polycyclic products are readily decomplexed by AgBF 4 , opening&#8208;up an efficient route to the formation of &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Captodative Effect Facilitates the Excitation in Diboron Molecule (CAAC)2B2(SH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the extraordinary versatility in chemical reactions and applications, boron compounds have gained increasing attentions in the past two decades. One of the remarkable advances is the unprecedented preparation of unsaturated boron species. Notably, Braunschweig et al. found that the cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs) stabilized diboron molecules (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 host unpaired electrons and exist in the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form, while other analogues such as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) stabilized diboron molecules prefer a conventional B=B double bond. Since previous studies recognized the differences in the steric effect between CAAC and NHC carbenes, here we focused on the role of thiol substituents in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by gradually localizing involved electrons. The co&#8208;planarity of the thiol groups and the consequent captodative effect were found to be the culprit for the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form of (CAAC)2B2(SR)2. Computational analyses identified two forces contributing to the &#960; electron movements. One is the &#8220;push&#8221; effect of lone pairs on the sulfur atoms which boosts the &#960; electron delocalization between the BB center and CAACs. The other is the &#960; electron delocalization within each (CAAC)B(SR) fragment where the pull effect originates from the &#960; electron withdrawal by CAACs. There are two such independent and orthogonal push&#8208;pull channels which function mainly in individual (CAAC)B(SR) fragments. This enhanced &#960; push&#8208;pull effect in the triplet state facilitates the electronic excitation in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrigued by diverse non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks occurring naturally in bacterial adhesins and pili domains, scientists have endeavored to expand crosslinker structures by using a variety of approaches and transpose this unusual topology to other robust protein scaffolds such as domain antibodies. This Concept summarizes recent advances in this fertile intersection of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and protein science.







Abstract
Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in the vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarize recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks by using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlight our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in&#8197;situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology&#8208;mimicking bacterial adhesins.

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of a series of Cu(II) complexes revealed several highly efficient mediators for radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. After optimization of the reaction conditions, their application enabled preparation of seven PET&#8208;tracers in improved radiochemical yields and/or using significantly lower precursor loadings.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in nBuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved 18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve 18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75&#8201;%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (S)&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1&#8201;% and 30&#177;3&#8201;% using only 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.

         <title>Carbodicarbenes and Striking Redox Transitions of their Conjugate Acids: Influence of NHC versus CAAC as Donor Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures and coordination behavior of carbodicarbenes bearing three possible combinations of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) (CAAC) are compared. The strikingly different redox transitions of their conjugate acids are also reported.







Abstract
Herein, a new type of carbodicarbene (CDC) comprising two different classes of carbenes is reported; NHC and CAAC as donor substituents and compare the molecular structure and coordination to Au(I)Cl to those of NHC&#8208;only and CAAC&#8208;only analogues. The conjugate acids of these three CDCs exhibit notable redox properties. Their reactions with [NO][SbF6] were investigated. The reduction of the conjugate acid of CAAC&#8208;only based CDC with KC8 results in the formation of hydrogen abstracted/eliminated products, which proceed through a neutral radical intermediate, detected by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduction of conjugate acids of NHC&#8208;only and NHC/CAAC based CDCs led to intermolecular reductive (reversible) carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bond formation. The resulting relatively elongated carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bonds were found to be readily oxidized. They were, thus, demonstrated to be potent reducing agents, underlining their potential utility as organic electron donors and n&#8208;dopants in organic semiconductor molecules.

The conjugate acids of these three CDCs exhibit notable redox properties. Their reactions with [NO][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] were investigated. The reduction of the conjugate acid of CAAC-only based CDC with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; results in the formation of hydrogen abstracted/eliminated products, which proceed through a neutral radical intermediate, detected by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduction of conjugate acids of NHC-only and NHC/CAAC based CDCs led to intermolecular reductive (reversible) carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bond formation. The resulting relatively elongated carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bonds were found to be readily oxidized. They were, thus, demonstrated to be potent reducing agents, underlining their potential utility as organic electron donors and n-dopants in organic semiconductor molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst allows the direct arylation polymerization of non&#8208;activated (poly)thiophenes with (poly)aryl halides leading to a series of 20 highly reticulated, porous and alternating conjugated polymers with yields from 50 to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst, combined with lithium hexamethyldisilazide as base, demonstrates its wide applicability in the direct arylation polymerization of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;thiophene heteroaryls with poly(hetero)aryl halides. With a nickel catalyst loading of 2.5&#8197;mol%, a series of twenty highly cross&#8208;linked organic polymers is obtained in 34 to 99&#8201;% yields. Using mixed polytopic coupling partners allows obtaining alternating and optically active thiophene&#8208;based solids with intrinsic porosity.

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>

ESIPT&#8208;type resorcin[4]arenes are capable of guest&#8208;binding in the cavity and generate FL response with large Stokes shift and size&#8208;selective enhancement of emission via the mechanism that involves (a) selective di&#8208;deprotonation, (b) generation of emissive double keto tautomeric forms, and (c) recognition&#8208;induced restriction of intramolecular motion.







Abstract
Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Investigated by Time&#8208;Resolved Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) emitter was investigated by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. This enabled upper excited states that contribute to spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to be detected.







Abstract
Emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S1)&#8208;triplet (T1) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by vibronic mixing with higher excited states Sn and Tn (n=2, 3, 4, &#8230;). For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA&#8208;DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.

The synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides has been achieved. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl source. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding nitrogen heterocycles in moderate to good yields. Notably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.

         <title>Rational Design and Synthesis of D&#8208;galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases</title>

New&#8208;to&#8208;Nature D&#8208;galactosyl lysophospholipids were rationally designed and synthesized to act as artificial substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases, which are validated drug targets for deadly human diseases including cancers, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and SARS&#8208;COVID&#8208;2 infection. Rational Design and Synthesis of D&#8208;galactosyl Lysophospholipids as Selective Substrates and non&#8208;ATP&#8208;competitive Inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases (X. Huang, J. Hu et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) produce lipid signaling molecules and have been attracting increasing attention as drug targets for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infection.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) produce lipid signaling molecules and have been attracting increasing attention as drug targets for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infection. Given the potential cross-inhibition of kinases and other ATP-utilizing enzymes by ATP-competitive inhibitors, targeting the unique lipid substrate binding site represents a superior strategy for PIPK inhibition. Here, by taking advantage of the nearly identical stereochemistry between &lt;i&gt;myo&lt;/i&gt;-inositol and D-galactose, we designed and synthesized a panel of D-galactosyl lysophospholipids, one of which was found to be a selective substrate of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase. Derivatization of this compound led to the discovery of a human PIKfyve inhibitor with an apparent IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 6.2&#8197;&#956;M, which significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect of Apilimod, an ATP-competitive PIKfyve inhibitor under clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2 infection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our results provide the proof of concept that D-galactose-based phosphoinositide mimetics can be developed into artificial substrates and new inhibitors of PIPKs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, are shown to be excellent photocatalysts in a range of different reactions, benchmarked against the widely used donor&#8208;acceptor TADF photocatalyst, 4CzIPN. Advantages of using these MR&#8208;TADF photocatalysts include robust and inexpensive photocatalyst synthesis, lower required photocatalyst loadings and faster reaction rates, while achieving comparable or improved product yields.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist's collection of photocatalysts.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Stannylenoids Stabilized by Amido/Imino Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stannylenoid was isolated by using a bulky amido ligand. It can be converted to the dimeric chlorostannylene at 80&#8201;&#176;C with the elimination of LiCl. Treatment of the amidostannylenoid with IPrNLi (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) led to the formation of amido(imino)stannylene. In addition, the reaction of bis(imino)stannylenoid with N2O resulted in a dimeric Sn/O/Li complex.







Abstract
The reaction of the lithium aryl(silyl)amide Dipp(iPr3Si)NLi (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with one equivalent of SnCl2 in THF gave a novel stannylenoid Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl&#8901;LiCl(THF)2. Heating the solution of amidostannylenoid in toluene to 80&#8201;&#176;C resulted in dimeric amido(chloro)stannylene [Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl]2, which can be converted to bis(amido)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)]2 and amido(imino)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)][IPrN] (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino). Treatment of bis(imino)stannylenoid [IPrN]2Sn(Cl)Li with N2O resulted in the dimeric complex [IPrNSn(Cl)OLi]2. All compounds were characterized by NMR, elementary analysis, and X&#8208;ray structural determination.

Photocatalysis: The increase in the degree of CN functionalization can regulate the D&#8208;A interaction with beneficial effects, such as broadened light absorption range, improved charge separation, enhanced interaction with Pt cocatalyst, and strengthened hydrophilicity, which achieves an excellent activity in the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dehydropolymerization of Phosphine&#8211;Boranes at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes [PhRP&#8208;BH2]n, including P&#8208;disubstituted derivatives, were accessed by deprotonation of a series of readily prepared phosphine&#8211;(triflimido)borane adducts. The choice of base impacts the polymer molar mass and linear/cyclic ratio and transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'P&#8208;BH2 are proposed intermediates.







Abstract
Stoichiometric reaction of phosphine&#8211;borane adducts RR'PH&#8901;BH3 (R=Ph, R&#8217;=H, Ph, Et, and R=R&#8217;=tBu) with the strong acid HNTf2 (Tf=SO2CF3) leads to H2 elimination and the formation of the triflimido derivatives, RR'PH&#8901;BH2(NTf2). Subsequent deprotonation by using bases, such as diisopropylethylamine or the carbene IPr (IPr=N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), led to the formation of P&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#8208;disubstituted polyphosphinoboranes [RR'P&#8208;BH2]n. Evidence for the intermediacy of transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'PBH2, was provided by trapping reactions.

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of five iodido antimonates with structurally very similar anions has been prepared, and the influence of the anion's size on the band gap and the presence of additional charge&#8208;transfer effects was investigated.







Abstract
Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used for metal halide perovskites. Due to the variable anion structures in group 15 halogenido metalates, similar family relations are still largely missing. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2nI6n+4]4&#8722; family of anions, including the first n=5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz=pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n=1&#8211;5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72&#8197;eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8722; unit, as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, thus providing a framework for understanding new and known compounds in this emerging class of materials.

         <title>Simultaneous Loading of Ni2P Cocatalysts on the Inner and Outer Surfaces of Mesopores P&#8208;Doped Carbon Nitride Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Splitting Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni2P cocatalysts were simultaneously loaded on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres to boost photocatalytic water splitting. The obtained Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P shows a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. The findings guide the design of composite photocatalysts and the better utilization of hollow nanostructured semiconductors for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. A simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P photocatalyst is reported. Ni2P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Multifunctional Organocatalysts &#8208; Singly&#8208;Linked and Macrocyclic Bisphosphoric Acids for Asymmetric Phase&#8208;Transfer and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>

Covalently linked bisphosphoric acids deliver enhanced stereoselectivities compared to their monofunctional counterparts. The nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence. Based on a library of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, we could identify catalysts suitable for electrophilic fluorinations and for asymmetric transfer&#8208;hydrogenations.







Abstract
The linking of phosphoric acids via covalent or mechanical bonds has proven to be a successful strategy for the design of novel organocatalysts. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, including their synthesis and their application in phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We found that the novel bisphosphoric acids show dramatically increased enantioselectivities in comparison to their monophosphoric acid analogues. However, the nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence on the enantioselectivities. In the asymmetric dearomative fluorination via phase&#8208;transfer catalysis, bisphosphoric acids with a single, rigid bisalkyne&#8208;linker give the best results with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. In contrast, bisphosphoric acids with flexible linkers give excellent enantioselectivities in the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation of quinolines via cooperative Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT calculations.

The binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by a majority of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers.







Abstract
We found the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by most of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers but are reduced in HEPES buffer through competitive binding. Nevertheless, salts do change the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to charged molecules through a screening effect.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles Catalyzed by NNP&#8211;Manganese(I) Pincer Complexes at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several NImNHP&#8208;Mn(I) pincer complexes were synthesised and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations. Their interesting catalytic activities were shown in several hydrogenation reactions of N&#8208;heterocycles with good to excellent performance under very mild conditions.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions have aroused widespread interest in recent years. Among the catalytic systems described, especially PNP&#8208; and NNP&#8211;Mn pincer catalysts have been reported for the hydrogenation of aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, aldimines and esters. Furthermore, NNP&#8722;Mn pincer compounds are efficient catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of less reactive amides, ureas, carbonates, and carbamates. Herein, the synthesis and application of specific imidazolylaminophosphine ligands and the corresponding Mn pincer complexes are described. These new catalysts have been characterized and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations, and their catalytic activities have been tested in several hydrogenation reactions with good to excellent performance. Especially, the reduction of N&#8208;heterocycles can be performed under very mild conditions.

         <title>Dielectric Relaxation and Dielectric Switching Behaviors in (N,N&#8208;Diisopropylethylamine) Tetrachloroantimonate(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric relaxation and dielectric switching behaviors of a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor are characterized by experiments and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. It contains a 1D chain, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature.







Abstract
Dielectric switches have drawn renewed attention to the study of their many potential applications with the adjustable switch temperatures (Ts). Herein, a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor, (N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate ((DIPEA)SbCl4, DIPEA+=N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound, consisting of coordinated anion 
 chains and isolated DIPEA+ cations, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (Ts). Variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structure analyses and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations give information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics. This work enriches the dielectric switch family and proves that hybrid metal halides are promising candidates for switchable physical or chemical properties.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Network Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited State Formation Within a Two&#8208;fold Catenated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electronically complementary linkers of the same framework are a well&#8208;studied pathway to achieve the photo&#8208;excited charge transfer state in a framework structure. Here, we show a mostly undiscovered strategy, how intercatenated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) endows ground&#8208;state donor&#8208;acceptor interaction from two networks of the same framework to facilitate the inter&#8208;net charge&#8208;transfer excited state through direct photo&#8208;excitation rendering the possibility in the energy conversion scheme.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of RGO&#8208;Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures by PVA&#8208;Assisted Freeze&#8208;Casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption

A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting is developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped&#8208;carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the resultant aerogel demonstrated an improved sound absorption property, especially at low frequencies. Moreover, the sample exhibits good microwave absorption performance and cyclic loading stability.







Abstract
Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze&#8208;casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increased from 0 to 15&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ml&#8722;1, the average pore size of the aerogel was reduced from 154 to 45&#8197;&#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound were optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO&#8208;10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8211;6300&#8197;Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8722;47.3&#8197;dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0&#8197;mm). Prospectively, this synthetic strategy can be extended to develop other forms of elastic aerogel with a controlled pore size.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component, solvent&#8208;dependent, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of benzaldehydes, silyl enolates and arene nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of potential drug candidate 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;indanones. This reaction features the formation of three C&#8722;C bonds, high regioselectivity in a one&#8208;pot strategy, broad substrate generality, facile scalability (1.04g), high functional group tolerance and viable substrates. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;silyl ethers generated in&#8208;situ from the Mukaiyama aldol reaction were subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed benzylic arylation with strong as well as weak nucleophiles, and the resultant &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl esters can undergo a third C&#8722;C bond formation with excellent regioselectivity through intramolecular cyclization to afford the indanone products in the same pot. Detailed mechanistic insight leads to a feasible reaction pathway. This transformation opens up a practical and adaptable approach to producing a variety of synthetically valuable transformations and enable the synthesis of medicinally valuable (R)&#8208;tolterodine and (+)&#8208;indatraline.

         <title>Sustainable Production of Molybdenum Carbide (MXene) from Fruit Wastes for Improved Solar Evaporation</title>

A sustainable novel synthesis of food waste conversion into molybdenum carbide samples for improved solar evaporation performances.







Abstract
Freshwater production using solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation is regarded as a green and sustainable strategy. The biggest barrier to practical deployment of solar desalination, however, continues to be the lack of options for renewable materials. Herein, we present a facile two&#8208;step carbonization approach that is sustainable for developing innovative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) materials derived from carbonized fruit wastes. The resultant 2D Mo2C photothermal layer has an efficient water evaporation rate of 1.52&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation, which is among the best reported values so far. The broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area (555.1&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) with large micro&#8208; and meso porosity, of the Mo2C photothermal layer are responsible for these outstanding results. The conversion of food wastes into valuable products, in this case MXene, can potentially inspire greener developments of advanced materials for solar water evaporator.

Clusters is a group of the same or different elements that aggregate closely together. Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications. The contributions of these cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials to the host&#8208;guest chemistry of iodine are summarized in the Review by W.&#8208;H. Fang and colleagues (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202638).

Shine a light! This Minireview shines a light on potential design strategies for luminophores with efficient emission in solution and the solid state. These so&#8208;called solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSE) can be regarded as interplaying phenomena between the classic effects of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Hence, they feature remarkable and ideally environmentally insensitive photophysical properties and will for sure find wide&#8208;ranging applications in the near future.







Abstract
For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation&#8208;sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shine a light&lt;/b&gt;! This Minireview shines a light on potential design strategies for luminophores with efficient emission in solution and the solid state. These so-called solution and solid-state emitters (SSSE) can be regarded as interplaying phenomena between the classic effects of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Hence, they feature remarkable and ideally environmentally insensitive photophysical properties and will for sure find wide-ranging applications in the near future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close-packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual-state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;olution and &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;olid-&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;tate &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;mitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation-sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Based Crystalline Materials for Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials play an important role in the field of iodine host&#8208;guest chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progress of different types of cluster&#8208;based materials (such as cluster&#8208;based MOFs with different cluster nodes, metal&#8208;organic cages, macrocyclic molecules, and cluster composites) for iodine capture. The research status, possible iodine capture mechanisms and prospects of such crystalline materials are discussed.







Abstract
The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively. Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications. Herein, recent progress of different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture is reviewed. Research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Electrochemical and Structural Characterization of Soft Landed Tungsten&#8208;Substituted Lindqvist Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lindqvist polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion processes due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten&#8208;substituted POV&#8208;alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms. Soft landing of mass&#8208;selected ions was used to purify heterometal POV&#8208;alkoxides that cannot be readily separated using conventional approaches. The soft landed POV&#8208;alkoxides are characterized using infrared reflection&#8208;absorption spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The redox properties of the isolated ions are examined using an in situ electrochemical cell which enables traditional in vacuo electrochemical measurements inside of an ion soft landing instrument. Although the overall cluster core retains redox activity after tungsten doping, vanadium&#8208;based redox couples (VV/VIV) are shifted substantially, indicating a pronounced effect of a heteroatom on the electronic structure of the core.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Rare&#8208;Earth/Lithium&#8208;Mediated Conversion of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The rare&#8208;earth/lithium cooperative effect on activation and functionalization of white phosphorus has been investigated. The reaction of diazabutadiene&#8208;supported&#160;yttrium hydride chelated a LiPPh2 molecule (LY&#215;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2[&#956;&#8208;PPh2(Li)] (1, L = N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene) with P4 gave two novel mixed Y/Li multinuclear polyphosphorus complexes(LY&#215;THF)2[cyclo&#8208;P3]Li(THF)3 (2) and [Li(THF)4]+[(LY&#215;THF)3(norborane&#8208;P7)Li(THF)]&#8208; (3), accompanied with the elimination of diphosphorus compound Ph2PPPh2 (4) and H2. However, the comparative reaction of yttrium hydride (LY&#215;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2&#160;with P4 afforded a trinuclear yttrium star&#8208;P4 complex (LY&#215;THF)3(m3&#8208;P(PH)3) (5). Further investigations show that 5 cannot continuously react with LiPPh2 to form 2 and 3, and LiPPh2 reacted with P4 to form a Zintl&#8208;P7 lithium complex (TMEDA.Li)3(Zintl&#8208;P7) (6) and 4. These results indicated that the cooperation of Y/Li for activation of P4 is a key for the formation of 2 and 3. All new compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Internal Charge Transfer on the Photophysical Properties of Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phosphaquinolinone scaffold has been previously studied as a modular core for a variety of fluorescent species where use of substituent effects has focused on increasing or decreasing electron density in the core rings. We now report the synthesis and analysis of several pyridine&#8208;containing phosphaquinolinone species exhibiting notable linear conjugation from the aryl&#8208;substituent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridyl nitrogen. Varying the nature of the aryl substituent from electron&#8208;withdrawing to electron&#8208;donating leads to the generation of an internal charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) band in the absorbance spectrum, which becomes the dominant absorbance in terms of intensity in the most electron&#8208;rich &#8211;NMe2 example. This heterocycle exhibits improved photophysical properties compared to others in the set including high quantum yield and considerably red&#8208;shifted emission. The enhanced ICT can be observed in the X&#8208;ray data where a rare example of molecule co&#8208;planarity is observed. Computational data show increased localization of negative charge on the pyridyl nitrogen as the electron&#8208;donating character of the aryl&#8208;substituent increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid&#8208;State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid&#8208;state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill&#8208;defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive&#8208;linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid&#8208;state current&#8208;voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion&#8208;induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B&#8208;form.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Structure and Photo&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Electric Property of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Liquid Crystalline Polymer Containing Poly(4&#8208;vinylpridine) and Cyanostilbene Side Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE) x , where x is the molar ratio of cyanostilbene (CN&#8208;DBE) to poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) repeating unit, were synthesized based on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between P4VP and CN&#8208;DBE. Their luminescent property, liquid crystalline structure and photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property were elucidated using photoluminescence spectra, X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal imaging and thermoelectric experiments. With the increase of x, the supramolecular system can be changed from lamellar structure to hexagonal columnar structure. Moreover, the P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE) x  polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photothermal effect. The temperature of P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)0.6 can rise to 130 &#176;C within 10 s under the irradiation of ultraviolet lamp. In addition, the supramolecular system possesses unique photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric conversion ability, and 25 mA current can be detected in the circuit coupled with the thermoelectric module. This work broadens the potential applications of hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer, and provides a simple and facile strategy to prepare liquid crystalline polymers with photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezoelectric&#160;Metal Organic Frameworks Mediated Mechanoredox&#160;Borylation&#160;and Arylation Reactions via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein,&#160;metal organic frameworks&#160;UiO&#8208;66 and&#160;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;were synthesized and their piezoelectric&#160;properties were characterized by piezoresponse force&#160;microscopy. Under mechanical agitation, the highly polarized UiO&#8208;66 and&#160;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;can act as electron donors&#160;to reduce aryl diazonium salts, forming the aryl radical species which further react with bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes to generate the desired products&#160;with broad substrate scope. For all substrates, it was found that the reactions mediated by UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;which exhibited better piezoelectric property were more efficient than those promoted by UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, we have shown the convenient regeneration of spent catalysts&#160;which can be reused for promoting mechanoredox reactions without loss of activities by taking advantage of the unmatched repairability of metal organic frameworks. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical pathway was involved in these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The allylic alcohol structural motif is prevalent in many important molecules and valuable building blocks. The rearrangement reaction is one of the most important transformations, however there are only a few reports for the 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols. Herein, we describe a 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols catalyzed by an Ir(III) dihydride complex. This reaction could provide the corresponding less accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively from readily available E/Z mixtures of the substrates. Furthermore, a tandem alkene isomerization followed by 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of homoallylic alcohols was also realized. In addition, this rearrangement reaction could be used to synthesize the natural product Navenone B. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the reaction pathway involved a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and that the dihydride in the iridium catalyst acts as a hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of the iridium center.</dc:description>

         <title>An Innovative Bi12SiO20 Multistage Cubic Nanospheres Cathode for High&#8208;performance Bi//Zn Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline&#160;Bi//Zn&#160;batteries&#160;with superb&#160;safety,&#160;low cost, and high power density are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. However, their developments&#160;are&#160;severely limited by the Bi&#8208;based cathode as the unsatisfying capacity and cycle&#160;life. Herein, an innovative multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20&#160;(MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20) is successfully synthesized by a simple&#160;calcination&#160;methode, which shows&#160;excellent&#160;energy storage performances&#160;of superior&#160;specific capacity (294&#160;mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 0.5&#160;A g&#8208;1)&#160;and&#160;outstanding rate capability&#160;(134 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 12&#160;A g&#8208;1). When coupled with Zn anode a superior MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 247.5&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1&#160;at the power density of 375&#160;W kg&#8208;1. Additionally, the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn battery shows excellent cycle life, which reserves more than 100% of its original capacity after 5000 cycles. Such performance is higher than previously reported Bi//Zn battery and most other Zn batteries. This is the first example of using Bi12SiO20&#160;as cathode for&#160;RAZBs, which may provide highly promising&#160;material towards better Bi//Zn&#160;battery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures via  i &#960;&#8211; i &#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, was synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Diterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus and Its Sponge&#8208;prey Chelonaplysilla sp.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigation of the South China Sea nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded, in addition to three known compounds, nine new diterpenoids of the 5,19&#8208;cycloclerodane&#8208; (sanyanolides A&#8722;D), clerodane&#8208; (sanyanolide E) and subersin&#8208; (sanyanolides F&#8722;I) type. Remarkably, six diterpenoids aforementioned from H. sanguineus were also isolated from the sponge Chelonaplysilla sp. from the same water region, suggesting a trophic relationship between H. sanguineus and Chelonaplysilla sp. The structure and absolute configuration of new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and/or time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these diterpenoids, along with the chemo&#8208;ecological implications of their co&#8208;occurrence in the two organisms investigated, was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassays, echinoclerodane A exhibited a potent inhibitory effect (IC50 = 2.81 &#956;M) on LPS&#8208;induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. In addition, echinoclerodane A and oculatolide showed considerable antibacterial activities with MIC values ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 &#956;g/mL.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Potent and Highly Selective Epoxyketone&#8208;based Plasmodium Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present remarkable epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000&#8208;fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic&#8208;stage P. falciparum over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D&#8208;amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from P. falciparum cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171&#8208;fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of P. falciparum proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a P. berghei mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6 days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti&#8208;malarial drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Double Aldol&#8208;Tishchenko Reaction of Butanone, Cyclobutanone and a 3&#8208;Pentanone Derived Sulfinylimine and DFT Calculations of the Stereo&#8208;determining Step</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p class="Abstract"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN&#8208;GB"&gt;Herein, we present a highly diastereoselective method to furnish acyclic 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diol derivatives using a tandem double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko protocol (&lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; up to &amp;gt;99:1) using a butanone derived sulfinylimine. In most cases only 1 diastereomer predominates, from a possible 16. The reaction is also regioselective. In addition, the highly challenging cyclobutanone and 3&#8208;pentanone derivatives are also amenable to a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction, although the &lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; values are modest. Despite that, clean single diastereoisomers can be isolated, which should prove very useful in medicinal chemistry and other areas. Detailed DFT calculations support the observed stereoselectivities in all cases, providing a rationale for the excellent &lt;italic&gt;dr&lt;/italic&gt; values in the butanone series and the moderate values for the 3&#8208;pentanone class.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(boranil) Columnar Liquid Crystalline Fluorophores: pseudo&#8208;Triphenylene Boron(III) Complexes with N3B3O3 Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borate complexes derived from salicylaldimine ligands, called boranils, possess a wide range of photophysical and electronic characteristics intrinsically. The unique combination of molecular rigidity, rendered by four&#8208;coordinate boron bridges, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation enable them to serve as technically feasible fluorescent materials (dyes). The incorporation of liquid crystallinity in these boron(III) complexes, especially the columnar (col) mesomorphism, which is overlooked hitherto, would provide a new dimension to these complexes. Herein, we report the first examples of tris(boranil) discotic liquid crystal (LC) dyes that have been readily synthesized by treating tris(N&#8208;salicylideneaniline)s, (TSAN)s, with BF3.Et2O in the presence of an acid quencher. These&#160;C3&#8208;symmetric borate complexes self&#8208;assemble into Col phase, existing over a wide thermal span including room temperature.&#160; The 2D periodic order of the Col phases shows dependence on the length of the peripheral tails. The photophysical measurements reveal the fluorescence emission in their two condensed states viz., solid and Col phase, and in the solution. Their electrochemical, two&#8208;step oxidation process coupled with the aforesaid features upholds their significance in applied research.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the rising field of organoindium chemistry little is known about the perfluoroorganyl&#8208;substituted indium compounds. The increasing use of indium reagents is explained by their high stability and tolerance towards water and functional groups. Here we report on the synthesis of the novel tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;, and its characterization in salts with the cations [Li(thf)3]+, Cs+, [PPh4]+&#160;and [H14O6]2+&#160;(thf = tetrahydrofuran). To the best of our knowledge, these salts constitute the first perfluoroalkylindates and, in general, the first isolated perfluoroalkylindium compounds which are fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Secondary Orbital Effect Involving Fluorine is Responsible for Substrate&#8208;Controlled Diastereodivergence in the Catalyzed syn&#8208;aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Fluoronitroalkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorine atom is a powerful, yet often enigmatic influence on chemical reactions. True to form, fluorine was recently discovered to effect diastereodivergence in an enantioselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction, resulting in a very rare case of syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane products. More bewildering was the observation of an apparent hierarchy of substituents within this substrate&#8208;controlled behavior: Ph&gt;F&gt;alkyl. These cases have now been examined comprehensively by computational methods, including both non&#8208;fluorinated and a&#8208;fluoro nitronate additions to aldimines catalyzed by a chiral bis(amidine) [BAM] proton complex. This study revealed the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions that dictate anti&#8208; (a&#8208;aryl) vs. syn&#8208;selectivity (a&#8208;alkyl) using &#945;&#8208;fluoronitronate nucleophiles, and an underlying secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and the activated azomethine.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radio&#8208;Iodination of Arenes by using Organosilane and Organogermane as Radiolabelling Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The radio&#8208;iodination of arenes is investigated from organosilane and organogermane precursors using Ipso&#8208;Electrophilic Halogenation (IEH). Discovery of a mild base mediated process allows radio&#8208;iodination in HFIP of either aryl silane or germane, with germanes being more reactive. Clinical potential of arylgermanes as radio&#8208;iodination precursors is demonstrated through the labelling of [125I]IMTO and [125I]MIBG thus offering an alternative to radio&#8208;iododestannylation processes using non&#8208;toxic precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized MOFs&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have become a research forefront in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction attributed to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, adjustable structure and abundant catalytic active sites. Particularly, MOFs can be facilely tuned to match CO2 photoreduction by means of post&#8208;modification of metal nodes, organic linkers with specific functions, and combined with other active materials. Herein, we highlight the recent advances in the construction strategy of MOF&#8208;based photocatalytic materials for CO2 reduction. Some systematic modification strategies on MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are also been discussed, such as modification of metal sites and organic ligands, construction of heterojunction, introduction of single/diatoms and strain engineering. Finally, the future developments directions of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysis in the field of CO2 reduction are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands to Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] is the Right Donor Set</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that leads to the progressive and irreversible loss of mental functions. The amyloid beta (A&#946;) peptide involved in the disease is responsible for the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when bound to Cu ions. A therapeutic approach, which consists in removing Cu ions from A&#946; to alter this deleterious interaction, is currently developed. In this context, we report the ability of 5 different 12&#8208;membered thiaazacyclen ligands to capture Cu from A&#946; and to redox silence it. We propose that the presence of a sole sulfur atom in the ligand increases the rate of Cu capture and removal from A&#946;, while the kinetic aspect of the chelation was an issue encountered with the 4N parent ligand. The best ligand in removing Cu from A&#946; and inhibiting the associated ROS production is the 1&#8208;thia&#8208;4,7,10&#8208;triazacyclododecane [3N1S]. Indeed the replacement of more N by S atoms makes the corresponding Cu complexes easier to reduce and thus able to produce ROS on their own. In addition, the ligand with three sulfur atoms has a weaker affinity for Cu(II) than A&#946;, and is thus unable to remove Cu from CuA&#946;.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects in Iron Porphyrin Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comparison of differently substituted iron porphyrins in their as&#8208;prepared state and after immobilization on carbon indicates no or only a weak interaction with the carbon support. Hydrogen evolution catalysis of the supported systems is improved by electron donating groups that destabilize an Fe(II) intermediate, presumably by assisting in the formation of a radical anion.







Abstract
For a future hydrogen economy, non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the water splitting reactions are needed that can be implemented on a global scale. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) catalysts with active sites constituting a metal center with fourfold coordination of nitrogen (MN4) show promising performance, but an optimization rooted in structure&#8208;property relationships has been hampered by their low structural definition. Porphyrin model complexes are studied to transfer insights from well&#8208;defined molecules to MNC systems. This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphyrin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance. We propose an HER mechanism for supported iron porphyrin complexes involving a [FeII(P&#8901;)]&#8722; radical anion intermediate, in which a porphinic nitrogen atom acts as an internal base. While this work focuses on the HER, the limited influence of a simultaneous interaction with the support and an aqueous electrolyte will likely be transferrable to other catalytic applications.

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;containing species can &#8220;chemically trap&#8221; CO2, and nesquehonite is one such metastable mineral. Its chemical formula has been debated for decades as Mg(HCO3)(OH)&#8901;2&#8201;H2O or MgCO3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O. The thermodynamics of the route to stable carbonates require knowledge of the captured CO2 as either a carbonate or bicarbonate. To determine the precise atomic coordinates of hydrogens present, we combined solid&#8208;state 13C NMR lineshapes and REDOR with density functional theory and confirmation by neutron diffraction. The perturbation of 13C NMR lineshapes by nearby hydrogens is a persuasive indicator. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;E. Hayes and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203052).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines. The developed method features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and a simple one&#8208;pot procedure without the need to prepare enolate equivalents separately, thus offering a general and practical approach to the synthesis of a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds. Experimental mechanistic investigations indicate that this amination proceeds through a unique radical coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical which are generated through a single&#8208;electron transfer between a lithium enolate and the hypervalent iodine reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S Ternary Heterostructures with Enhanced LSPR effect for NIR Photonic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photonic disinfection, particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light triggered antibacterial, has emerged as a highly promising solution for combating pathogenic microbes due to its spatiotemporal operability, safety, and low cost of apparatus. However, it remains challenging to construct NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial agents with high light&#8208;converting efficacy and elucidate synergistic mechanisms. In this work, novel ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S ternary heterostructures that can efficiently kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria were synthesized by doping 0D Bi2S3 and Cu2S nanoparticles in the 2D BiOCl nanosheets via a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method. Notably, the incorporation of Cu2S nanoparticles bestows strong NIR light&#8208;harvesting capability to the composite nanosheets due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Upon NIR light illumination, the BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets can exert both enhanced photonic hyperthermia and reaction oxygen species (ROS) generation, serving as single light&#8208;activated bi&#8208;functional photothermal and photodynamic therapeutics. Here, high&#8208;speed hot electrons and large local electronic fields caused by LSPR might play important roles on thermal vibrations and effective carrier separations respectively. Benefiting from the unique ternary heterostructures, both the photothermal conversion efficacy and ROS generation efficacy of BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets are remarkably improved in comparison to the binary BiOCl&#8208;Cu2S or BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3 nanosheets. Accordingly, the ternary composite nanosheets can effectively kill bacteria via the NIR&#8208;driven photonic disinfection mechanism. This work presents a new type of 2D composite nanosheets with ternary heterostructures for NIR photonic disinfection.</dc:description>

         <title>An&#160;Aluminium Imide as a Transfer Agent for the [NR]2&#8208; Function via Metathesis Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with a range of oxygen&#8208;containing substrates have been probed with a view to developing its use as a novel main group transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8208; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] units driven thermodynamically by Al&#8208;O bond formation. N2O reacts rapidly to generate the organoazide DippN3 (Dipp = 2,6&#8208; iPr2C6H3), while CO2 (under dilute reaction conditions) yields the corresponding isocyanate, DippNCO. Mechanistic studies, using both experimental and quantum chemical techniques, identify a carbamate complex K2[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8208;(N,O)&#8208;N(Dipp)CO2}]2 (formed via [2+2] cycloaddition) as an intermediate in the formation of DippNCO, and also in an alternative reaction leading to the generation of the amino&#8208;dicarboxylate complex K2[(NON)Al{&#954;2(O,O')&#8208;(O2C)2N(Dipp)}] (via the take&#8208;up of a second equivalent of CO2). In the case of benzaldehyde, a similar [2+2] cycloaddition process generates the metallacyclic hemi&#8208;aminal complex, Kn[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8208;(N,O)&#8208;(N(Dipp)C(Ph)(H)O}]n. Extrusion of the imine, PhC(H)NDipp, via cyclo&#8208;reversion is disfavoured thermally, due to the high energy of the putative aluminium oxide co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(O)]2. However, addition of CO2 allows the imine to be released, driven by the formation of the thermodynamically more stable aluminium carbonate co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(&#954;2&#8208;(O,O')&#8208;CO3)]2.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering electronic and structural effects in Copper Corrole/Graphene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent hybrid materials based on graphene and A3&#8208;type copper corrole complexes were computationally investigated. The corroles complexes contain strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents at the meso positions. Our results show that the non&#8208;innocent character of corrole moiety modulates the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties once the hybrid systems are held. The graphene&#8208;corrole hybrids displayed outstanding stability via the interplay of dispersion and electrostatic driving forces, while graphene act as an electron reservoir. The hybrid structures exposed an intriguing magneto&#8208;chemical performance, compared to the isolated counterparts, that evidenced how structural and electronic effects contributed to the magnetic response for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Directional spin polarization and spin transfer from the corrole to the graphene surface participate in the amplification. Finally, there are relations between the spin transfer, the magnetic response, and the copper distorted ligand field, offering exciting hints about modulating the magnetic response. Therefore, this work shows that copper corroles emerged as versatile building blocks for graphene hybrid materials, especially in applications requiring a magnetic response.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor aziridines with N&#8208;aryl protected imines were developed with a Ni(ClO4)2&#183;6H2O/N,N&#697;&#8208;dioxide catalyst system, providing a broad range of chiral trans&#8208;substituted imidazolidine compounds with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% yields, up to 98% ee). Control experiments indicated that the products could offer excellent diastereoselectivities with the control of chiral Ni(II)&#8208;N,N&#697;&#8208;dioxide complex and the interaction of the substrates. The possible catalytic process was proposed to rationalize the stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strongly twisted benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene, containing three dibenzosuberenone units fused to a common benzene ring, was subjected to Ramirez olefination and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acids. The high steric demand within the overcrowded, benzene&#8208;rich benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylenes enforced an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;rearrangement upon &#960;&#8208;extension during the Suzuki coupling reaction. According to crystal structure analysis, the resulting negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consist of two heptagons and one octagon surrounding a central benzene ring as a result of strain release. In the solid state, the materials exhibit a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence with increased quantum yields and a hypsochromic shift of the emission maxima compared to their respective solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Control of Fluorescence Blinking Patterns Based on Electron Transfer in DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging uses changes in the fluorescence intensity and emission wavelength to analyze multiple targets simultaneously. To increase the number of targets that can be identified simultaneously, fluorescence blinking can be used as an additional parameter. To understand and eventually control blinking, we used DNA as a platform to elucidate the processes of electron transfer (ET) leading to blinking, down to the rate constants. With a fixed ET distance, various blinking patterns were observed depending on the DNA sequence between the donor and acceptor units of the DNA platform. The blinking pattern was successfully described with a combination of ET rate constants. Therefore, molecules with various blinking patterns can be developed by tuning ET. It is expected that the number of targets that can be analyzed simultaneously will increase by the power of the number of blinking patterns.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free intermolecular coupling reaction of halocompounds with styrenes in the presence of NaH and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline was developed.

Our method allows the use of a wide range of halocompounds, including aryl and alkyl halides, and good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Synthesis of Efficient and Stable Tetrabutylammonium Copper Halides with Dual Emissions for Warm White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to achieve high color rendering index (CRI) and low correlated color temperature (CCT) indoor lighting, single component phosphors with broadband dual emission emission are high demanded for white light emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, phosphors with such fluorescent properties are rare at present. Herein, we report a facile solid&#8208;state chemical method for the synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor with broadband emission and large Stokes shift that can meet the requirements of future white light sources. These new tetrabutylammonium copper halides phosphors have excellent warm white emission characteristics, and their luminescence peaks located at 494 nm and 654 nm, respectively. The optimized photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield can reach 93.7%. The typical CIE coordinate of the as&#8208;fabricated WLED is at (0.3620, 0.3731) with CRI of 89 and low CCT of 4516 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Level, Crystal Morphology and Fluorescence Emission Tuning in Cocrystals via Molecular&#8208;Level Engineering</title>

New DCAF based charge transfer cocrystals with tunable energy level, crystal morphology and fluorescence emission were prepared via a cocrystal engineering method.







Abstract
Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene &#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through a rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering strategy. Although they are both 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structures, the DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DCPY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted DCPE nanobelts, and the small band gap causes near infrared fluorescence. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space groups and weaker intermolecular interactions exhibited an untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.

         <title>Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on of Tetraphenylethylene Derivative by Transfer from Cyclodextrin to Liposomes, HeLa Cells, and E. coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's fluorescence time! Although the tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) was fluorescence OFF state in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx), the fluorescence turn&#8208;on was observed in the liposomes, HeLa cells, and E. coli, because TPE&#8722;OH4 was transferred from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid or cell membranes.







Abstract
Herein, trimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx) and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) in water through high&#8208;speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was much higher than that of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex, as the rotation of the central C=C double bond of TPE&#8722;OH4 after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8722;OH4 from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, it was demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase&#8208;transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon, TPE&#8722;OH4 could detect the presence of HeLa cells and E. coli by fluorescence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's fluorescence time&lt;/b&gt;! Although the tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was fluorescence OFF state in &#947;-cyclodextrin (&#947;-CDx), the fluorescence turn-on was observed in the liposomes, HeLa cells, and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, because TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was transferred from the &#947;-CDx cavity to the lipid or cell membranes.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, trimethyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (TMe-&#946;-CDx) and &#947;-cyclodextrin (&#947;-CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in water through high-speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe-&#946;-CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complex was much higher than that of the &#947;-CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complex, as the rotation of the central C=C double bond of TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe-&#946;-CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;-CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;-CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from the &#947;-CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn-on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, it was demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase-transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn-on phenomenon, TPE&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; could detect the presence of HeLa cells and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; by fluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Disproportionation and Ligand Lability in Low Oxidation State Boryl&#8208;Tin Chemistry

The carbene&#8208;stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2], can be synthesized from (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br using Mg(I) or K reducing agents. In contrast to their germanium congeners, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation: NHC abstraction from (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and 2&#8208;electron oxidation of K2[Sn2(boryl)2] both yield a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of Sn(boryl)2 and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4. A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve the vinylidene&#8208;type intermediate (boryl)2Sn=Sn.







Abstract
Boryltin compounds featuring the metal in the+1 or 0 oxidation states can be synthesized from the carbene&#8208;stabilized tin(II) bromide (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br (boryl={B(NDippCH)2}; NHC=C{(NiPrCMe)2}) by the use of strong reducing agents. The formation of the mono&#8208;carbene stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) (2) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2] (3), using Mg(I) and K reducing agents mirrors related germanium chemistry. In contrast to their lighter congeners, however, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation. Carbene abstraction from 2 using BPh3, and two&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 both result in the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of the Sn(II) compound Sn(boryl)2, and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4 (4). A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve a vinylidene intermediate (analogous to the isolable germanium compound, (boryl)2Ge=Ge), which undergoes facile atom transfer to generate Sn(boryl)2 and trinuclear [Sn3(boryl)2]. The latter then dimerizes to give the observed hexametallic product 4, with independent studies showing that similar trigermanium species aggregate in analogous fashion.

         <title>Preorganized Polyaromatic Soft Terdentate Hosts for the Capture of [Ln(&#946;&#8208;diketonate)3] Guests in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

For its binding to the La(hfac)3 lanthanum container, the benzimidazole side arms of the terdentate ligand L1 must rotate to reach the cis&#8208;cis arrangement required for the formation of the heteroleptic [L1La(hfac)3] complex. The novel rigid, planar and cis&#8208;cis preorganized ligand L8 avoids this energy penalty and increases the overall stability of the final [L8La(hfac)3] complex by three orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations has successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more overlooked. The resulting rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (L1&#8211;L7) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;h][1,7]naphthyridines (L8&#8211;L11) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [LkLn(hfac)3] adducts (Lk=L1, L8, L9; Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb, Y; H&#8208;hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) show a drastic decrease in the Ln&#8722;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand L1 with its preorganized counterparts L8 and L9. This points to a limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)3] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion, with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)3 when L1 is replaced by the preorganized L8&#8211;L9 receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [L1Ln(hfac)3] complexes in solution. This driving force overcomes the poor match between the preorganized terdentate N&#8745;N&#8745;N cavity in L8 and L9 and the size of trivalent lanthanides. As planned, the rigid, planar and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system found in L8 and L9 shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands by about 5000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 toward lower energies, a crucial point if these stable [L8Ln(hfac)3] and [L9Ln(hfac)3] platforms have to be considered for the visible sensitization of luminescent lanthanides in metallopolymers.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Free Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A little light on electrolytes: We take a timely and comprehensive look at the criteria for high&#8208;voltage magnesium metal batteries (RMBs) from the viewpoint of high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding electrolyte/anode interphase. Potential high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding interphase degradation mechanisms are analyzed in depth.







Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safe energy storage devices has spurred increasing interest in high&#8208;voltage rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB). As electrolytes are the bridge connecting the cathode and anode materials, the development of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes is the key factor in realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs. This concept presents an overview of three chloride&#8208;free electrolyte systems with wide electrochemical windows, together with the degradation mechanisms and modification strategies at the anode/electrolyte interphase. Finally, future directions in stabilizing Mg anodes and realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs are highlighted.

         <title>Harnessing the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d System for Protein Detection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Based Transcription Amplification</title>

Transcriptional immuno&#8208;CRISPR: A target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for proteins was rationally designed by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based target recognition and binding&#8208;induced in&#8208;vitro transcription to trigger Cas13d&#8208;mediated signal amplification. Such a dual recognition/amplification mode enables protein detection with high specificity and sensitivity, expanding CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d diagnostic toolbox significantly.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensing technology has been emerging as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for many disease&#8208;related biomarkers. In particular, RspCas13d, a newly identified RNA&#8208;guided Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus sp., has shown great promise for accurate and sensitive detection of RNA due to its RNA sequence&#8208;specific recognition and robust collateral trans&#8208;cleavage activity. However, its diagnostic utility is limited to detecting nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;related biomarkers. To address this limitation, herein we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for protein biomarkers. This system was rationally designed by integrating a dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based transcription amplification strategy with CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d (DATAS&#8208;Cas13d), in which the protein binding initiates in&#8208;vitro RNA transcription followed by the activation of RspCas13d. Using a short fluorescent ssRNA as the signal reporter and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the model analyte, the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system showed a wide linear range, low detection limit, and high specificity for the detection of cTnI in buffer and human serum. Thanks to the facile integration of various bioreceptors into the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system, the method could be adapted to detecting a broad range of clinically relevant protein biomarkers, and thus broaden the medical applications of Cas13d&#8208;based diagnostics.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Synergistic Catalysis of Pd single atoms and nanoparticles under Near&#8208;Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Synthesis of a synergistic catalyst of Pd single atoms and Pd nanoparticles is presented, which shows broad catalytic activity towards hydrogenation of organic nitro molecules and functional aromatics.







Abstract
Due to the limited resources and high cost of noble metals, boosting their catalytic activities is highly desired in the current catalysis industry. Here, we report a synergetic catalyst, combining Pd2+ and Pd0 species in a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons (NPC), which shows boosted catalytic activities in hydrogenation reactions of organic nitro compounds (nitrobenzene, 4&#8208;nitrophenol, 1&#8208;nitronaphthalene and 1&#8208;nitropropane) under near ambient conditions. This synergetic catalyst NPC&#8208;[Pd] was synthesized by partial reduction of a palladium&#8208;loaded NPC. The catalytic activities and selectivity of NPC&#8208;[Pd] for hydrogenation were enhanced significantly compared with those of NPC&#8208;Pd2+ or NPC&#8208;Pd0 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations show that H2 preferentially dissociates on Pd nanoparticles, and then organic molecules (nitrobenzene) can be captured and react with the dissociated H atom on Pd2+ sites. Similar reaction procedure also occur on Pt or Rh. Hydrogenation of different aromatic compounds with different functional groups (naphthalene, 4&#8208;nitrochlorobenzene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone) confirmed the broad excellent catalytic activity of this synergistic catalyst.

         <title>Crystallographic Deciphering of Spontaneous Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral Calciphores to Chiral Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating a metal&#8208;deprivation strategy, a new skeleton of thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine natural product (thiapyricins) with calcium&#8208;binding property was discovered from metal&#8208;tolerant extremophile, Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004. Their characteristic co&#8208;occurrence in the &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form of octahedral chirality visualizes achiral natural products assemble into chiral complexes.







Abstract
Thiapyricins (TPC&#8208;A/B, 1 and 2), which are new metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal&#8208;deprived conditions by Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine skeleton of a calcium&#8208;binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co&#8208;crystalline characteristics of the apo&#8208; and holo&#8208;forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four&#8208;hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal&#8208;chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.

         <title>Heteropoly Blue/Carbon Nanotubes Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. The HPB/CNTs (20&#8201;%) shows promising prospects in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To realize the direct and full use of the widely distributed solar energy, developing novel materials with superb photothermal conversion capability is essential. Although heteropoly blue has intrinsic outstanding solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties, its spectral absorption in the infrared region is weak. Here, composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. As a result, the light absorption of the optimized HPB/CNTs (20&#8201;%) reaches more than 95&#8201;% in the range of 200&#8211;2400&#8197;nm, showing promising prospects as high&#8208;performance photothermal conversion material in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Porous 2D Lattices from C3&#8208;symmetric Ph6&#8722;Me&#8208;Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;OAc3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STM investigation of temperature&#8208;controlled deposition of hexaphenyl&#8208;methyltribenzotriquinacene with thermolabile acetate groups revealed highly ordered coverage and temperature dependent self&#8208;assembly of this C3 symmetric structure. At higher temperature the structure flattens and interacts strongly with the metal substrate due to loss of all acetate groups and the methyl groups resulting in an unsaturated triquinacene core.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly of molecules to form holey nanographenes is a promising approach to control the properties of the resulting 2D lattice. Usually, planar molecules are utilized to prepare flat, structurally confined molecular layers, with only a few recent examples of warped precursors. However, control of the superstructures is limited thus far. Herein, we report the temperature&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of a bowl&#8208;shaped, acetylated C3&#8208;symmetric hexaphenyltribenzotriquinacene derivative on Cu(111). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;&#8208;stacked bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon&#8208;based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on&#8208;surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.

Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;-stacked bowl-to-bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon-based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on-surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Foldable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery with Gear&#8208;Structured Composite as Freestanding Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gearing up for portable devices: A flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery uses a freestanding cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of over 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;, and a better capacity retention of &gt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;. The highly flexible, safe, aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens up a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronic devices.







Abstract
A foldable battery with high flexibility provides great potential in various wearable electronic devices for health and fitness tracking, chronic disease management, performance monitoring, navigation tracking, and portable gears for soldiers. We report a highly flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery with a free&#8208;standing cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of up to 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;. An aqueous hydrogel consisting polyvinyl alcohol, glycerin and Zn(CF3SO3)2 was used as electrolyte, which showed as high as 580&#8201;% tensile strain under a loading weight of 78&#8197;N. The battery exhibited a better capacity retention of over 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8&#8201;% after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;, thereby indicating a great self&#8208;healing performance. The gear&#8208;like geometry greatly improved the volume accommodation due to the increased interval space between the blades and the outward configuration. Meanwhile the Zn2+ ionic conductivity was improved by rapid re&#8208;binding of many existing hydroxy groups from the electrolyte and the enhanced contact surface area and diffusion route from the cathode material. The highly flexible, safe aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronics under mechanical agitation.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling through Nitrogen Deletion: Application to Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The main idea behind this study was to bring &#8220;nitrogen deletion&#8221; chemistry into production of compound libraries, and it was successfully done through formal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling of &#8220;benzylic&#8221; amines and (hetero)aromatic aldehydes.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202203470).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Oleksandr Grygorenko and his Ukrainian colleagues at Enamine Ltd., Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and ChemSpace, as well as Mark&#8197;Levin at the University of Chicago. The image depicts application of a nitrogen&#8208;deleting anomeric amide to parallel C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202203470.

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The accumulation of the catalyst at the gas/IL interface is even more pronounced than expected from the surface activity of the free ligand.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202203325).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Hans&#8208;Peter&#8197;Steinr&#252;ck and Peter&#8197;Wasserscheid at the Friedrich&#8208;Alexander&#8208;Universit&#228;t Erlangen&#8208;N&#252;rnberg. The image depicts two Pt catalysts dissolved in an ionic liquid. For one of them, fluorinated side chains in the ligand system act as buoys leading to pronounced enrichment of the complex at the gas/IL interface, as is evidenced by strongly enhanced Pt signals in angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. For the complex without fluorinated side chains, no such effect is observed. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202203325.

         <title>Crystallization of a Neptunyl Oxalate Hydrate from Solutions Containing Np(V) and the Uranyl Peroxide Nanocluster U60Ox30</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uranyl peroxide nanoclusters are an evolving family of materials with potential applications throughout the nuclear fuel cycle. While several studies have investigated their interactions with alkali and alkaline earth metals, no studies have probed their interactions with actinide elements. This work describes a system containing U60Ox30, [((UO2)(O2))60(C2O4)30]60&#8208;, and neptunium(V) as a function of neptunium concentration. Ultra&#8208;small and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering were used to observe these interactions in the aqueous phase, and X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to observe solid products. The results show that neptunium induces aggregation of U60Ox30 when the neptunium concentration is&#160;&#8804; 10 mM, whereas (NpO2)2C2O4&#183;6H2O(cr) and studtite ultimately form at 15&#8208;25 mM neptunium. The latter result suggests that neptunium coordinates with the bridging oxalate ligands in U60Ox30, leaving metastable uranyl peroxide species in solution, and is an important finding given the potential application of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters in the recycling of used nuclear fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Templating influence of regulated inorganic framework in two&#8208;dimensional ferroelastic perovskites: (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M = Mn and Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The remarkable material stability and structural diversity of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) constitute a vast available library of versatile materials. In particular, ferroelastic property, for which the spontaneous strain can be transformed by applying mechanical stress, is very promising for extensive nanotechnological applications. However, integrating ferroelastic property into 2D OIHPs is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed two new 2D OIHPs (C3H5CH2NH3)2[MCl4] (M = Mn for 1 and Cd for 2), which undergo reversible ferroelastic phase transitions with an Aizu expression 4/mmmFmmm. The templating influence of the more distorted inorganic framework on the disordering of organic cations and the stronger hydrogen bonds has a key role in the striking improvement of Curie temperature from 246 K in 1 to 273 K in 2. Meanwhile, the minimized alteration of structural motif ensures the well maintaining of the ferroelastic performance in the forms of crystals and thin films, as demonstrated by the identifiable evolution of domain structures. This work will provide a fertile new ground for enlarging the limited number of 2D ferroelastic OIHPs with better practical utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;fullerene Electron Acceptors based on Hybridisation of Corannulene and Thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we show that hybridisation of buckybowl corannulene and thiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide motifs is a general approach for the preparation of high electron affinity molecular materials. The devised synthesis is modular and relies on thienannulation of corannnulene&#8208;based phenylacetylene scaffolds. The final compounds are highly soluble in common organic solvents. These compounds also exhibit interesting optical properties such as absorption in the blue/green and emission in the green/red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Importantly, a bis&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide derivative exhibits three reversible reductions similar in their strength to the prevalent fullerene&#8208;based electron acceptor phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium(II)&#8208;dithiocarbazates as Anticancer Agents: Synthesis, Solution Behavior, and Mitochondria&#8208;targeted Apoptotic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the Ru(PPh  3  )  3  Cl  2  with HL  1&#8722;3  &#8722;OH (&#8722;OH stands for the oxime hydroxyl group; HL  1  &#8722;OH = diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;benzyldithiocarbazonate; HL  2  &#8722;OH = diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;(4&#8208;methyl)benzyldithiocarbazonate; and HL  3  &#8722;OH = diacetylmonoxime&#8208;S&#8208;(4&#8208;chloro)benzyl&#8208;dithiocarbazonate) gives three new ruthenium complexes [RuII(L  1&#8722;3  &#8722;H)(PPh  3  )  2  Cl] (  1  &#8211;  3  ) (&#8722;H stands for imine hydrogen) coordinated with dithiocarbazate imine as the final products. All ruthenium(II) complexes (  1  &#8211;  3  ) have been characterized by elemental (CHNS) analyses, IR, UV&#8722;vis, NMR (  1  H,  13  C, and  31  P) spectroscopy, HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS spectrometry and also, the structure of  1  &#8722;  2  was further confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The solution/aqueous stability, hydrophobicity, DNA interactions, and cell viability studies of  1  &#8722;  3  against HeLa, HT&#8208;29, and NIH&#8722;3T3 cell lines were performed. Cell viability results suggested  3  being the most cytotoxic of the series with IC  50  6.9 &#177; 0.2 &#181;M against HeLa cells. Further, an apoptotic mechanism of cell death was confirmed by cell cycle analysis and Annexin V&#8208;FITC/PI double staining techniques. In this regard, the live cell confocal microscopy results revealed that compounds primarily target the mitochondria against HeLa, and HT&#8208;29 cell lines. Moreover, these ruthenium complexes elevate the ROS level by inducing mitochondria targeting apoptotic cell death.</dc:description>

         <title>Green synthesis and analytical characterization of core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study demonstrates a simple and reproducible approach to synthesize green core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles stabilized by poly(n&#8208;vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Cu@PVP colloids were here prepared using copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor and glucose as reducing agent. The presence of PVP in the synthetic medium eliminates the need for an inert atmosphere during the process, thus simplifying the whole method. Both the morphology and the spectroscopic properties of Cu@PVP were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and infrared, UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Size distributions and average shell thickness were obtained by statistical analysis on TEM micrographs, and spectroscopies demonstrated the formation of a PVP layer around the copper core. The produced colloids were employed in composite thin films for potential antimicrobial application, in association with a highly&#8208;recyclable polymer: polycarbonate (4,4'&#8208;(1&#8208;methylethylidene)bis(phenol)).</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Teflates Revisited: from the Lewis Superacid [Au(OTeF5)3] to the Anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new synthetic access to the Lewis acid [Au(OTeF5)3] and the preparation of the related, unprecedented anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; with inorganic or organic cations starting from commercially available and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle gold chlorides are presented. In this first extensive study of the Lewis acidity of a transition metal teflate complex using different experimental and quantum chemical methods, [Au(OTeF5)3] was classified as a Lewis superacid. The solid state structure of the triphenylphosphane adduct [Au(OPPh3)(OTeF5)3] was determined, representing the first structural characterization of an adduct of this highly reactive [Au(OTeF5)3]. Therein, the coordination environment around the gold center slightly deviates from the typical square planar geometry. The related, unprecedented anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; shows a similar coordination motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Tweezers for N&#8208;Glycans. Selective Recognition of the Core GlcNAc2 Disaccharide of the Sialylglycopeptide SGP.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, glycomics have shown how pervasive is the role of carbohydrates in biological systems and how chemical tools are essential to investigate glycan function and modulate carbohydrate&#8208;mediated processes. Biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates can carry out this task but, although significant affinities and selectivities toward simple saccharides have been achieved, targeting complex glycoconjugates remains a goal yet unattained. In this work we report the unprecedented recognition of a complex biantennary sialylglycopeptide (SGP) by a tweezers&#8208;shaped biomimetic receptor, which selectively binds to the core GlcNAc2 disaccharide of the N&#8208;glycan with an affinity of 170 &#956;M. Because of the simple structure and the remarkable binding ability, this biomimetic receptor can represent a versatile tool for glycoscience, opening the way to useful applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Control of Glucocerebrosidase Inhibitors: Towards Photoswitchable Pharmacological Chaperones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperidine&#8208;based photoswitchable derivatives have been developed as putative pharmacological chaperones for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease (GD). The&#160;structure&#8208;activity study&#160;revealed that both the iminosugar and the light&#8208;sensitive azobenzene are essential features to exert inhibitory activity towards human GCase and a system with the correct inhibition trend (IC50&#160;of the light&#8208;activated form lower than IC50&#160;of the dark form) was identified. Kinetic analyses showed that all compounds are non&#8208;competitive inhibitors (mixed or pure) of GCase and the enzyme allosteric site involved in the interaction was identified by means of MD simulations.&#160;A moderate activity enhancement of mutant GCase assessed in GD patients&#180; fibroblasts (ex&#8208;vivo&#160;experiments) carrying the most common mutation was recorded. This promising observation paves the way for further studies to improve the benefit of the light&#8208;to&#8208;dark thermal conversion for chaperoning activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free Engineering toward Efficient Zinc Storage: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;based energy storage has lately gained popularity due to natural abundance, operational safety, high energy density. Unfortunately, dendrite growth is a common and intractable issue faced in existing zinc&#8208;ion batteries to shorten cycle lifespan/stability. This review summarizes recent progress in assembly component (e. g., anode, electrolyte, separator) engineering for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;ion batteries. First, diversiform strategies of Zn surface modification and Zn host design are presented to shield the fundamental adverse effect aroused by uneven zinc deposition on the anode. Then, subtle deployments of electrolyte constituents are illustrated to optimize the Zn2+ solvation structure for ultimate dendrite control and Coulombic efficiency elevation in aqueous systems and beyond (e.g., eutectic electrolytes). Furthermore, rational manipulation of advanced separators and the upgrade of zinc metal&#8208;free Zn2+&#8208;storage devices are briefly discussed to explore the dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;storage. Finally, challenges and perspectives are proposed to offer research inspirations toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Process Engineering and Glycosyltransferase Improvement for Short Route Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of GM1 Gangliosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large&#8208;scale synthesis of GM1, an important ganglioside in mammalian cells especially those in the nervous system, is needed to explore its therapeutic potential. Biocatalytic production is a promising platform for such a purpose. We report herein the development of process engineering and glycosyltransferase improvement strategies to advance chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1. Firstly, a new short route was developed for chemical synthesis of lactosylsphingosine from the commercially available Garner&#8217;s aldehyde. Secondly, two glycosyltransferases including Campylobacter jejuni &#946;1&#8211;4GalNAcT (CjCgtA) and &#946;1&#8211;3&#8208;galactosyltransferase (CjCgtB) were improved on their soluble expression in E. coli and enzyme stability by fusing with an N&#8208;terminal maltose binding protein (MBP). Thirdly, the process for enzymatic synthesis of GM1 sphingosines from lactosylsphingosine was engineered by developing a multistep one&#8208;pot multienzyme (MSOPME) strategy without isolating intermediate glycosphingosines and by adding a detergent, sodium cholate, to the later enzymatic glycosylation steps. Installation of a desired fatty acyl chain to GM1 glycosphingosines led to the formation of target GM1 gangliosides. The combination of glycosyltransferase improvement with chemical and enzymatic process engineering represents a significant advance in obtaining GM1 gangliosides containing different sialic acid forms by total chemoenzymatic synthesis in a short route and with high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene Derivatives Embedded with AIE Luminogens and Their Fluorescence Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through McMurry coupling reaction, three meso&#8208;position functionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives (H&#8208;1, H&#8208;2, and H&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared by embedding aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens, diphenyldibenzofulvene (DPDBF) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)) into the skeleton of supramolecular macrocycles. H&#8208;1, bearing [15]paracyclophane ([15]PCP) and DPDBF moiety, exhibits yellow emission and demonstrates obvious AIE effect. In order to further improve the host&#8208;guest properties of this type of structure, H&#8208;2 and H&#8208;3 are prepared by replacing the [15]PCP moiety with pillar[5]arene backbone, both of which show significant AIE effect and excellent host&#8208;guest complexation properties with pyrazine salt guest G&#8208;1 and 1,4&#8208;dicyanobutane G&#8208;2. Our findings indicate that G&#8208;1 can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the AIE macrocycles, while G&#8208;2 can increase their fluorescence intensity in solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded, depending on the size and basicity of the anion, new cascade complexes or plenates, i.e., cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The nature of the product was counterion&#8208;dependent, and its formation was either driven by the cascade anion binding or by the argentophilic interactions stabilizing the cluster within the cavity. The reaction of plenates with tetrabutylammonium halides resulted in the protonation&#8208;coupled replacement of the Ag33+ with anion(s), yielding cascade cryptates.</dc:description>

         <title>Destruction of a Cu metal&#8211;organic framework&#160;to induce CuPt growth as a heterojunction&#160;catalyst for hydrogen peroxide sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ABSTRACT: Assembling bimetallic alloys (BAs) with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form heterojunctions has emerged as a promising strategy for the construction of highly active electrocatalysts. However, the current approaches to prepare BA@MOF heterojunctions suffer from poor controllability. In this work, we report a fascinating method involving partial thermal reduction and galvanic replacement to induce CuPt growth on a CuHHTP MOF (HHTP= 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) to construct a CuPt@CuHHTP heterojunction. The size of the CuPt nanoparticles can be effectively regulated by modifying the reduction temperature. The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and potential as an electrochemical H2O2 sensor with a low detection limit (5 nM), high sensitivity (6.942 mA&#183;mM&#8208;1&#183;cm&#8208;2), and outstanding selectivity. This in situ approach provides not only new insights into the preparation of BA@MOF&#8208;based heterojunctions but also an effective approach for the optimization of the catalytic performance of MOFs and related materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoted Photothermal Catalytic CO Hydrogenation by Using TiC&#8208;Supported Co&#8722;Fe5C2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;Fe5C2/TiC catalysts absorb light from the visible to near&#8208;infrared regions for efficient photo&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion. Plasmonic hot&#8208;electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 further modulates the chemical states of Fe on the Fe5C2 surfaces, enabling a 7.2&#8208;fold increase in C2+ yield in photothermal CO hydrogenation.







Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation offers the potential to synthesize light hydrocarbons by using solar energy. However, the selectivity and activity of the reaction are still far below those achieved in conventional thermal catalytic processes. Herein, we report that the Co&#8208;modified Fe5C2 on TiC catalyst promotes photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation with a 59&#8201;% C2+ selectivity in the produced hydrocarbons and a 30&#8201;% single&#8208;pass CO conversion at a high gas hourly space&#8211;time velocity of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using in&#8208;situ&#8208;irradiated XPS, we show that light&#8208;induced hot electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 modulates the chemical state of Fe, thereby increasing the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Co-Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiC catalysts&lt;/b&gt; absorb light from the visible to near-infrared regions for efficient photo-to-thermal conversion. Plasmonic hot-electron injection from TiC to Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; further modulates the chemical states of Fe on the Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surfaces, enabling a 7.2-fold increase in C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; yield in photothermal CO hydrogenation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation offers the potential to synthesize light hydrocarbons by using solar energy. However, the selectivity and activity of the reaction are still far below those achieved in conventional thermal catalytic processes. Herein, we report that the Co-modified Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on TiC catalyst promotes photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation with a 59&#8201;% C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity in the produced hydrocarbons and a 30&#8201;% single-pass CO conversion at a high gas hourly space&#8211;time velocity of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Using in-situ-irradiated XPS, we show that light-induced hot electron injection from TiC to Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; modulates the chemical state of Fe, thereby increasing the CO-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. This work suggests that it is possible for plasmon-mediated surface chemistry to enhance the activity and selectivity of photothermal catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stirring&#8208;Free Scalable Electrosynthesis Enabled by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is receiving increased interest as a versatile tool for mild and selective electrochemical transformations. In this work, we demonstrate that AC can enable the concept of a stirring&#8208;free electrochemical reactor where the periodic switch of electrode polarity, inherent to AC, provides uniform electrolysis across the whole volume of the reactor. Such design implies a straightforward approach for scaling up electrosynthesis. This was demonstrated on the range of electrochemical transformations performed in three different RVC&#8208;packed reactors on up to a 50&#8208;mmol scale. Redox&#8208;neutral, oxidative, and reductive processes were successfully implemented using the suggested design and the applicable frequency ranges were further investigated for different types of reactions. The advantages of the AC&#8208;enabled design &#8211; such as the absence of stirring and a maximized surface area of the electrodes &#8211; provide the possibility for its universal application both for small&#8208;scale screening experimentation and large&#8208;scale preparative electrosynthesis without significant optimization needed in between.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of the boryl&#8208;substituted SnII bromide {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5 equivalents of potassium graphite leads to the generation of the cyclic tetra&#8208;tin tetra&#8208;boryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion. This system is non&#8208;aromatic as determined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift Calculations (NICS(0) = &#8722;0.28, NICS(1) = &#8722;3.17), with the primary contributing resonance structures shown by Natural Resonance Theory (NRT) to involve a Sn=Sn double bond and 1,2&#8208;localized negative charges. Abstraction of the K+ cations or oxidation leads to contraction or cleavage of the Sn4 unit, respectively, while protonation generates the neutral dihydride 1,2&#8208;Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4H2 (a heavier homologue of cyclobutene) in a manner consistent with the predicted charge distribution in the [Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4]2&#8208; dianion.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNAs with Modified and 19F&#8208;Labelled Nucleotides by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>More than 170 post&#8208;transcriptional modifications of RNAs have currently been identified. Detailed biophysical investigations of these modifications have been limited since large RNAs containing these post&#8208;transcriptional modifications are difficult to produce. Further, adequate readout of spectroscopic fingerprints are important, necessitating additional labeling procedures beyond the naturally occurring RNA modifications. Here, we report the chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of RNA modifications and several structurally similar fluorine&#8208;modified analogs further optimizing a recently developed methodology.[1] This chemo&#8208;enzymatic method allows synthesis of also large RNAs. We were able to incorporate 16 modified nucleotides and 6 19F&#8208;labeled nucleotides. To showcase the applicability of such modified large RNAs, we incorporated a 19F&#8208;labelled cytidine into the aptamer domain of the 2&#8217;dG sensing riboswitch (2&#8217;dG&#8208;sw) from Mesoplasma florum, enabling characterizing RNA fold, ligand binding and kinetics. Thanks to the large chemical shift dispersion of 19F, we can detect previously postulated but difficult to detect conformational heterogeneity in the apo state of the riboswitch.</dc:description>

         <title>Live monitoring of anionic living polymerizations by electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic polymerizations are of exceptional practical importance, but difficult to analyze due to the high reactivity of the growing polymer chains. Here, we demonstrate that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) permits the direct observation of the active carbanionic intermediates formed in the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1&#8209;cyanocyclopropane&#8208;carboxylate in tetrahydrofuran. This includes the identification of a side product, as well as the real&#8208;time analysis of the polymerization reaction. From the obtained mass spectra, we can derive not only the mean molar mass and the polydispersity, but also the rate constants for the initiation and the individual propagation steps. The initation proceeds significantly faster than the propagation steps. Accordingly, the examined reaction corresponds to a living polymerization, as we also confirmed by additional control experiments. Besides giving detailed insight into the reaction system probed here, we expect the presented methodology to make possible the in&#8208;situ analysis of further anionic polymerizations as well.</dc:description>

         <title>A molecular insight into the dehydration of metal&#8208;organic framework and its impact on the CO2 capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous material formed by the self&#8208;assembly of metallic ligands and organic linkers. They are a good candidate for CO2 gas capture because they have large surface areas and the metal or linker can be tuned to improve CO2 uptake. In the quest for water and acid stable MOFs, a phosphonate&#8208;based organic linker has recently been designed by Glavinovic et al. (Chem. Eur. J. 2022, e202200874). By combining ionic calcium nodes, water and methanol molecules, they formed a microporous network, CALF&#8208;37. This network has been shown to be robust and can maintain its pore shape even in absence of water molecules or by the inclusion of gas molecules, such as CO2. The network can be heated to release the water and methanol molecules and form a dehydrated MOF, which retains its shape with the imprinted pore within. Herein, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to provide insight into the CO2 capture and sequestration ability of the CALF&#8208;37. We model the dehydration of the inactivated MOF (HCALF&#8208;37) in the absence and in the presence of methanol molecules by progressively withdrawing water molecules from the MOF networks. We determine the crystal structure of the intermediate states from HCALF&#8208;37 to CALF&#8208;37 and shed light on the critical role of water molecules in the mediation of metal&#8208;linker bonds. Our calculations also reveal that the favorable interactions between the CO2 molecules and the aromatic core of the linkers and metallic ions are responsible for the efficient sequestration of the gas in the CALF&#8208;37.</dc:description>

         <title>Guanidine functionalized fluorescent sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework for sensing and capture of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium is a key element in fuel cells, electronic industries, and organic catalysis. At the same time, chromium is essential in leather, electroplating, and metallurgical industries. However, their unpremeditated leakage into aquatic systems has caused human health and environmental apprehensions. Herein, we reported the development of an sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated fluorescent covalent organic framework with a guanidine moiety (sp2c&#8208;gCOF) that showed excellent thermal and chemical stability. The sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed effective sensing, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions which could be due to the highly accessible pore walls decorated with guanidine moieties. The fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed higher selectivity for Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.7 and 3.2 nM, respectively. The analysis of the adsorption properties with a pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model showed that sp2c&#8208;gCOF could successfully and selectively remove both Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The polymer also showed excellent capture efficacy even after seven consecutive adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Hence, this study reveals the potential of fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF for detecting, removing, and recovering valuable metals and hazardous ions from wastewater which would be useful for economic benefit, environmental safety, human health, and sustainability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification of sp2c&#8208;COF with suitable functionalities could also be useful for sensing and extracting other water pollutants and valuable materials from an aqueous system</dc:description>

         <title>Higher&#8208;order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloadditions are an important class of reactions in materials science for the construction of polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds. Recently, cycloadditions have been expanded beyond the &#8220;classical&#8221; group of cycloadditions involving 6&#960;&#8208;electrons, and it is now possible to control cycloadditions for an extended number of &#960;&#8208;electrons by applying organocatalysis. This novel field of cycloadditions&#8212;termed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions&#8212;allows for new synthetic methodologies to construct polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heteroaromatic compounds in two or three dimensions. This Perspective presents higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a method for accessing two and three dimensional azulenes and cyclazines, as well as, three dimensional indenes, as polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>An Improved Spectrophotometric Method for Toluene&#8208;4&#8208;Monooxygenase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monooxygenases, an important class of enzymes, have been the subject of enzyme engineering due to their high activity and versatile substrate scope. Reactions performed by these biocatalysts have long been monitored by a colorimetric method involving the coupling of a dye precursor to naphthalene hydroxylation products generated by the enzyme. Despite the popularity of this method, we found the dye product to be unstable, preventing quantitative readout. By incorporating an extraction step to solubilize the dye produced, we have improved this assay to the point where quantitation of enzyme activity is possible. Further, by incorporating spectral deconvolution, we have, for the first time, enabled independent quantification of the two possible regioisomeric products: 1&#8208;naphthol and 2&#8208;naphthol. Previously, such analysis was only possible with chromatographic separation, increasing the cost and complexity of analysis. The efficacy of our improved workflow was evaluated by monitoring the activity of a toluene&#8208;4&#8208;monooxygenase enzyme from Pseudomonas mendocina KR&#8208;1. Our colorimetric regioisomer quantification was found to be consistent with chromatographic analysis by HPLC. The development and validation of a quantitative colorimetric assay for monooxygenase activity that enables regioisomeric distinction and quantification represents a significant advance in analytical methods to monitor enzyme activity. By maintaining facile, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput readout while incorporating quantification, this assay represents an important alternative to more expensive chromatographic quantification techniques.</dc:description>

Glycosyl radical involved C&#8208;glycosylated modifications are important strategies to achieve highly regio&#8208; and chemoselective constructions of C&#8208;glycosidic bonds or C&#8208;glycoside linkages of peptides and proteins.

         <title>Asymmetrical Platinum and Rhodium Dinuclear Complex Strongly Bound to Filled dz2 Complexes by Unbridged Pt&#8211;metal Bonds Toward Heterometallic&#8208;Extended Metal Atom Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic extended metal atom chains (EMACs) aligned with three types of metals were rationally synthesized by forming unbridged metal&#8211;metal bonds based on the interactions between highest and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals at the dz2 orbital. These chains form pentanuclear structures aligned as Rh&#8211;Pt&#8211;M&#8211;Pt&#8211;Rh with relatively large formation constants of 5.0 &#215; 1013 M&#8722;2 for M = Pt and 6.3 &#215; 1011 M&#8722;2 for M = Pd, while retaining their backbones in solution. In the case of M = Cu, the original Cu(+2) atoms were reduced to be Cu(+1) during the synthetic process. Cu(+1) has an unprecedented trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The reported synthesis based on asymmetrical dinuclear complexes provides a guideline for the synthesis of hetero&#8208;EMACs to allow several analogs via judicious combinations realized by tuning the number of metal nuclei and metal species.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonmetallic nitrogen doped MnO2 as highly efficient oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices to solve the problem of energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, we reported the synthesis of nitrogen doped MnO2 (N&#8208;MnO2) to replace the noble metal electrocatalysts for air cathode in ZABs. The doped N atoms here introduced more Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies for MnO2, enhancing charge transfer property and accelerating surface intermediate product during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).&#160;&#160;Hence, the best N&#8208;MnO2 achieved remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards ORR&#160;(half&#8208;wave potential of 0.797 V vs. RHE), and reversible oxygen overpotential of around 0.842 V, which is better than or comparable to the Pt/C and Mn&#8208;based catalysts reported recently. Moreover, the homemade ZABs based on N&#8208;MnO2 showed the maximum power density of 132.8 mW cm&#8208;2 and excellent cyclic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Maytansinol Functionalization: Towards Useful Probes for Studying Microtubule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis as well as biochemical and structural characterization of long&#8208;chain maytansinoids and maytansinoid conjugates is reported. The results show the prospects of maytansinoids as probes to study microtubule dynamics and lead towards the design of new maytansine&#8208;based derivatives.







Abstract
Maytansinoids are a successful class of natural and semisynthetic tubulin binders, known for their potent cytotoxic activity. Their wider application as cytotoxins and chemical probes to study tubulin dynamics has been held back by the complexity of natural product chemistry. Here we report the synthesis of long&#8208;chain derivatives and maytansinoid conjugates. We confirmed that bulky substituents do not impact their high activity or the scaffold's binding mode. These encouraging results open new avenues for the design of new maytansine&#8208;based probes.

         <dc:description>
A good chemistry, like a great music, sometimes needs a good collaboration. The Cover Picture shows a combination of nitrogen&#8208;deleting anomeric amide power (discovered by Levin's group from the University of Chicago) and parallel synthesis capabilities of Ukrainian chemists, which resulted in a combinatorial library obtained through formal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling and a unique synthetically accessible chemical space of nearly 600&#8197;K representatives.

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated side chains of a functionalized Pt complex in an ionic liquid act as buoys, leading to pronounced enrichment of the complex at the IL/gas interface, as is evidenced by strongly enhanced Pt signals in angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. For complexes without these side chains no such effect is observed. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8208;P.&#8197;Steinr&#252;ck and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstruction of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts during water oxidation has become a common understanding. The obtained metal (oxy)hydroxide layers derived from surface reconstruction process usually show much higher electrocatalytic performance than the directed synthesized (oxy)hydroxide counterparts, highlighting the key role of interaction between substrate materials and surface reconstructed active species. Read more about reconstructed chemistry and substrate effect in transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts in the Review article by W. Luo et&#8197;al.







Abstract
The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.

         <title>Preparation and Functionalization of Mono&#8208; and Polyfluoroepoxides via Fluoroalkylation of Carbonyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new synthetic methodology that allows tandem 1,2&#8208;addition and ring closure reactions between fluoroalkyl anion synthons and carbonyl electrophiles to form fluorinated epoxides. We clarify the generality of the reaction sequence by examining the fluoroalkyl requiremements. This approach enabled access to unique compounds that can be diversified through either ring opening or ring opening defluorinative functionalization reactions.







Abstract
We outline a new synthetic method to prepare mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxides from a diverse pool of electrophiles (ketones, acyl chlorides, esters) and fluoroalkyl anion equivalents. The initially formed &#945;&#8208;fluoro alkoxides undergo subsequent intramolecular ring closure when heated. We demonstrated the versatility of the method through the isolation of 16 mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxide products. These compounds provide unique entry points for further diversification via either fluoride migration coupled with ring opening, or defluorinative functionalization reactions, the latter of which can be used as a late&#8208;stage method to install select bioactive moieties. The reaction sequences described herein provide a pathway to functionalize the commonly observed products formed from 1,2&#8208;addition into carbonyl electrophiles

         <title>Edge&#8208;Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by an Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkoxy highly edge&#8208;decorated polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been formed. Oxidative cross coupling of phenols constructs frameworks without any need for the prefunctionalization required by conventional methods. Moreover, smaller optical gaps can be achieved relative to systems of similar size.







Abstract
Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates used in conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for constructing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined in a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of the two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization. The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.

Diastereoisomer separation: Through the use of a well&#8208;defined enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylic ruthenium(IV) precatalyst, facile access to enantioenriched indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one emitters was achieved. Facile separation of diastereoisomers demonstrated mirror image chiroptical responses.







Abstract
A novel enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylruthenium(IV) precatalyst allowed the enantioselective and stereospecific allylations of indoles and gave access to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, containing vicinal stereogenic centers. Facile separation of diastereoisomers exhibiting opposite circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in diverse solvents, including water, demonstrated the potential of these sustainable transformations and of the newly prepared molecules.

         <title>Acceleration Effect of Bowl&#8208;Shaped Structure in Aerobic Oxidation Reaction: Synthesis of Homosumanene ortho&#8208;Quinone and Azaacene&#8208;Fused Homosumanenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic strain in the molecule considerably accelerates the oxidation rate of peripheral carbons in aromatic compounds. The aerobic oxidation of hydroxyhomosumanene proceeds much faster than for the planar analogue because of their unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization caused by the curved structure. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was converted to several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, and their crystal structures, photophysical properties, and charge transport properties were investigated.







Abstract
An oxidation reaction of hydroxyhomosumanene on silica gel providing homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone and its synthetic application for azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes is described. Hydroxyhomosumanene is photochemically oxidized by air, when it is coated on silica gel; this aerobic oxidation proceeds faster than that of planar analogues. The difference of such reactivity was attributed to the unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization due to structural difference between planar and curved &#960;&#8208;system. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was used in the synthesis of several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, azaacenohomosumanenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the single crystals revealed their columnar stacking structures due to the interactions between each bowl. Azaacenohomosumanenes exhibited high electron affinity due to the combination of buckybowl and electron&#8208;deficient azaacene moieties.

         <title>Assembly of Helical Nanostructures: Solvent&#8208;Induced Morphology Transition and Its Effect on Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just add water: Self&#8208;assembled intermediates were thoroughly modulated from an minimal model phenylalanine&#8208;based derivative (LPFM) featuring a C2 structure with single l&#8208;Phe conjugated on para&#8208;benzene. By altering the ratio of ethanol/H2O co&#8208;solvents, a dynamic morphological evolution of nanofibers from right&#8208; to left&#8208;handedness was successively revealed. The left&#8208;handed nanostructures were found to be favorable for cell adhesion and proliferation.







Abstract
Being able to precisely manipulate both the morphology and chiroptical signals of supramolecular assemblies will help to better understand the natural biological self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Two simple l/d&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;based derivatives (L/DPFM) have been designed, and their solvent&#8208;dependent morphology evolutions are illustrated. It was found that, as the content of H2O in aqueous ethanol solutions was increased, LPFM self&#8208;assembles first into right&#8208;handed nanofibers, then flat fibrous structures, and finally inversed left&#8208;handed nanofibers. Assemblies in ethanol and H2O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology&#8208;dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left&#8208;handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for cell adhesion than right&#8208;handed nanostructures. Quantitative AFM analysis showed that the L929&#8197;cell adhesion force on left&#8208;handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Moreover, the value of cell Young's modulus is lower for left&#8208;handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell&#8208;substrate interactions might lead to different effects on cell behavior.

Finding out the angles: Flow chemistry using microreactors makes it possible to obtain 5&#8208;diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, which cannot be synthesized in batch processes. The observation of equilibrium processes under 1&#8197;min is feasible by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which also reveals that a slight change in the angle of the constituent molecule affects the dynamic equilibrium in solution and crystal structure.







Abstract
5&#8208;Diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (1), which is inaccessible by conventional batch methods, was synthesized by using a flow microreactor. Compound 1 was obtained as an equilibrium mixture of a cyclic trimer and a cyclic tetramer in solution, the latter of which was crystallized in benzene by vapor diffusion of hexane at 7&#8201;&#176;C. The dynamic nature of this system was confirmed by solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent experiments. Notably, the dynamics was verified by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the time required to reach equilibrium was influenced by the solvent ratio (&lt;18&#8197;s, 24&#8211;28&#8197;s, and 34&#8211;42&#8197;s in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixtures of [D6]acetone and C6D6, respectively). Compound 1 and 3&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine (2) exhibited different self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution and crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggested that this difference was largely due to enhanced planarity between two consecutive aromatic rings.

         <title>Molecular Rotational Correlation Times and Nanoviscosity Determined by 111mCd Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) of &#947;&#8208;rays Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brownian molecular tumbling rates in solution have been measured by using 111mCd perturbed angular correlation of &#947;&#8208;rays (PAC) spectroscopy and a de novo designed molecular probe (a trimeric coiled&#8208;coil protein). Most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays, and PAC spectroscopy might find applications where conventional methods probing rotational correlation times, for example, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, cannot be applied&#8212;from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.







Abstract
The nanoviscosity experienced by molecules in solution may be determined through measurement of the molecular rotational correlation time, &#964;c, for example, by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. With this work, we apply PAC spectroscopy to determine the rate of rotational diffusion, &#955;=1/&#964;c, of a de novo designed protein, TRIL12AL16C, in solutions with viscosities, &#958;, from 1.7 to 88&#8197;mPa&#8901;s. TRIL12AL16C was selected as molecular probe because it exhibits minimal effects due to intramolecular dynamics and static line broadening, allowing for exclusive elucidation of molecular rotational diffusion. Diffusion rates determined by PAC data agree well with literature data from fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, and scales linearly with 1/&#958; in agreement with the Stokes&#8211;Einstein&#8211;Debye model. PAC experiments require only trace amounts (&#8764;1011) of probe nuclei and can be conducted over a broad range of sample temperatures and pressures. Moreover, most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays. Thus, PAC spectroscopy could find applications under circumstances where conventional techniques cannot be applied, spanning from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR crystallography and neutron diffraction can settle a longstanding debate regarding the chemical formula for the CO2 mineralization target species, nesquehonite, through examination of the effects of H on 13C tensors. It is a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O], and not a hydroxy&#8208; hydrated&#8208; magnesium bicarbonate.







Abstract
Nesquehonite is a magnesium carbonate mineral relevant to carbon sequestration envisioned for carbon capture and storage of CO2. Its chemical formula remains controversial today, assigned as either a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O], or a hydroxy&#8208; hydrated&#8208; magnesium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO3)OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O]. The resolution of this controversy is central to understanding this material&#8216;s thermodynamic, phase, and chemical behavior. In an NMR crystallography study, using rotational&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance 13C{1H} (REDOR), 13C&#8722;1H distances are determined with precision, and the combination of 13C static NMR lineshapes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to model different H atomic coordinates. [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O] is found to be accurate, and evidence from neutron powder diffraction bolsters these assignments. Refined H positions can help understand how H&#8208;bonding stabilizes this structure against dehydration to MgCO3. More broadly, these results illustrate the power of NMR crystallography as a technique for resolving questions where X&#8208;ray diffraction is inconclusive.

         <title>How Research Data Management Plans Can Help in Harmonizing Open Science and Approaches in the Digital Economy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of open science into a digital economy, while considering legal European regulations, is a balancing act. Here research data management plans play a key role and has the potential to combine the interests of researchers as data producers and the public as data users in publicly funded projects.







Abstract
Within this perspective article, we intend to summarise definitions and terms that are often used in the context of open science and data&#8208;driven R&amp;D and we discuss upcoming European regulations concerning data, data sharing and handling. With this background in hand, we take a closer look at the potential connections and permeable interfaces of open science and digital economy, in which data and resulting immaterial goods can become vital pieces as tradeable items. We believe that both science and the digital economy can profit from a seamless transition and foresee that the scientific outcomes of publicly funded research can be better exploited. To close the gap between open science and the digital economy, and to serve for a balancing of the interests of data producers, data consumers, and an economy around services and the public, we introduce the concept of generic research data management plans (RDMs), which have in part been developed through a community effort and which have been evaluated by academic and industry members of the NFDI4Cat consortium. We are of the opinion that in data&#8208;driven research, RDMs do need to become a vital element in publicly funded projects.

         <title>Co&#8208;based Catalysts for Selective H2O2 Electroproduction via 2&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Among them, Co&#8722;based catalysts have been widely studied for the selective production of H2O2 by 2&#8208;electron ORR. Here, this review focuses on the mechanism of 2&#8208;electron ORR from the perspective of kinetics and thermodynamics and summarizes the research progress of Co&#8722;based catalysts including Co molecular catalysts, Co nanoparticles, Co compounds, and Co single atom catalysts. It was demonstrated that Co&#8722;based catalysts had exhibited great selectivity towards 2&#8208;electron ORR. Finally, we also discuss the challenges faced by various types of catalysts.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process is emerging as a promising alternative method to the conventional anthraquinone process. To realize high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 electrosynthesis, robust and low cost electrocatalysts have been intensively pursued, among which Co&#8722;based catalysts attract particular research interests due to the earth&#8208;abundance and high selectivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the advancement of Co&#8722;based electrocatalyst for H2O2 electroproduction. The fundamental chemistry of 2&#8208;electron ORR is discussed firstly for guiding the rational design of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the development of Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts involving nanoparticles, compounds and single atom catalysts is summarized with the focus on active site identification, structure regulation and mechanism understanding. Moreover, the current challenges and future directions of the Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts are briefly summarized in this review.

         <title>Enhancing the Resistive Switching Behavior of WORM Memory Devices Using D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A Based Ester&#8208;Flanked Quinolines
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic memory devices: Ester&#8208;flanked quinoline&#8208;based triarylamines in a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture attributed to a facile intramolecular charge transfer which contributes to a WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times) memory characteristic. The structural integrity and stability of the device gives new dimensions to the organic memristors with a balanced charge carrier concept.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A system constituting ester&#8208;flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times (WORM) non&#8208;volatile memory.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organic memory devices&lt;/b&gt;: Ester-flanked quinoline-based triarylamines in a donor-acceptor architecture attributed to a facile intramolecular charge transfer which contributes to a WORM (Write-Once Read-Many times) memory characteristic. The structural integrity and stability of the device gives new dimensions to the organic memristors with a balanced charge carrier concept.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donor-Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A system constituting ester-flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single-step cross-coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write-Once Read-Many times (WORM) non-volatile memory. Structure-property relationships are reconnoitered for these conjugated D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A systems through a series of UV, fluorescence, XRD, DFT, and memory characterizations. The UV and CV data show efficient charge transfer with intramolecular charge transfer occurring at 407&#8211;417&#8197;nm and a short band gap of 2.56&#8211;2.65&#8197;eV. An enhancement in the resistive switching behavior of the memory devices is observed for the compounds with simple TAA-quinoline and tert-butylphenyl substituted TAA and fluorophenyl substituted quinoline due to balanced charge distribution in the compounds.

         <title>Structural and Functional Insight into the Mechanism of the Fe&#8722;S Cluster&#8208;Dependent Dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;S cluster&#8208;dependent dehydratases (DHTs) from the ilvD/EDD superfamily play an central role in enzyme cascades for the biomanufacture of the platform chemical isobutanol. Here, functional data for the DHT from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus have provided unprecedented insight into the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes that may inform bioengineering approaches to optimise the cascade.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades play an increasingly important role for the sustainable manufacture of diverse chemicals from renewable feedstocks. For instance, dehydratases from the ilvD/EDD superfamily have been embedded into a cascade to convert glucose via pyruvate to isobutanol, a platform chemical for the production of aviation fuels and other valuable materials. These dehydratases depend on the presence of both a Fe&#8722;S cluster and a divalent metal ion for their function. However, they also represent the rate&#8208;limiting step in the cascade. Here, catalytic parameters and the crystal structure of the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT, both in presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+) were investigated. Rate measurements demonstrate that the presence of stoichiometric concentrations Mn2+ promotes higher activity than Mg2+, but at high concentrations the former inhibits the activity of PuDHT. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the position of a second binding site for the divalent metal ion. Only binding of Mn2+ (not Mg2+) to this site affects the ligand environment of the catalytically essential divalent metal binding site, thus providing insight into an inhibitory mechanism of Mn2+ at higher concentrations. Furthermore, in silico docking identified residues that play a role in determining substrate binding and selectivity. The combined data inform engineering approaches to design an optimal dehydratase for the cascade.

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Neutral Oxoborane and Thioxoborane Supported by a Bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;stabilized neutral oxoborane and thioxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand have been synthesized and structurally characterized. While previous synthetic attempts of oxoborane ligated by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (NacNac) did not allow for its isolation in acid&#8208;free form, oxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand is isolable, due to the absence of imine &#593;&#8208;protons and steric protection of enamine carbon. The utility of bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand suggests further applications of the scaffold as a synthetically viable yet chemically inert substitute of the prototypical NacNac ligands.

Organic photoreactions &#8220;on water&#8221;, namely in aqueous suspension or emulsion, are significantly accelerated in this ecologically favorable medium.







Abstract
Two representative organic photoreactions, namely a bimolecular photocycloaddition and a monomolecular photorearrangement, are presented that are accelerated when the reaction is performed &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, that is, at the water&#8208;substrate interface with no solvation of the reaction components. According to the established models of ground&#8208;state reactions &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, the enhanced efficiency of the photoreactions is explained by hydrophobic effects (Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction) or specific hydrogen bonding (di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement) at the water&#8208;substrate interface that decrease the energy of the respective transition state. These results point to the potential of this approach to conduct photoreactions more efficiently in an ecologically favorable medium.

         <title>A Simple Substitution on Thyroid Hormones Remarkably Alters the Regioselectivity of Deiodination by a Deiodinase Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) plays key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. This chemical model study reveals that the modulation of the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in T4 through the phenolic group has a remarkable influence on the regioselectivity of the deiodination.







Abstract
The regioselective deiodinations of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4&#8242;&#8208;phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal of all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8722;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4&#8208;imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.

         <title>Di&#8208;Iron(II) [2+2] Helicates of Bis&#8208;(Dipyrazolylpyridine) Ligands: The Influence of the Ligand Linker Group on Spin State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This diiron(II) complex has been crystallized in three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of the butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl ligand linker groups. The crystals exhibit a range of spin state properties, including stepwise spin&#8208;crossover of the two iron atoms. A related ligand with a rigid pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl spacer forms more a distorted, high&#8208;spin diiron(II) helicate structure.







Abstract
Four bis[2&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}&#8208;6&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl}pyridine] ligands have been synthesized, with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl (L1), pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl (L2), benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylenyl (L3) and propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl (L4) linkers between the tridentate metal&#8208;binding domains. L1 and L2 form [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L)2]X4 (X&#8722;=BF4&#8722; or ClO4&#8722;) helicate complexes when treated with the appropriate iron(II) precursor. Solvate crystals of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2][BF4]4 exhibit three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of their butanediyl linker groups. The solvates exhibit gradual thermal spin&#8208;crossover, with examples of stepwise switching and partial spin&#8208;crossover to a low&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;spin form. Salts of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L2)2]4+ are high&#8208;spin, which reflects their highly twisted iron coordination geometry. The composition and dynamics of assembly structures formed by iron(II) with L1&#8722;L3 vary with the ligand linker group, by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations imply the butanediyl linker conformation in [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2]4+ influences its spin state properties, but show anomalies attributed to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the iron atoms.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid/Base Site Isolated in a Pentanuclear Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the traditional framework of acid&#8208;base chemistry, H+ always locates at a position that can provide a thermodynamically stable state. Here, we report the first example of H+ that exists in its thermodynamically metastable state using steric isolation of Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites within a heterometallic multinuclear complex. The current study offers a novel strategy for controlling the location of H+ within materials.







Abstract
The concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Lowry acids and bases is long and widely recognized as the most reasonable theory to explain the behavior of H+ ions. Here, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid/base pair that does not follow this theory. Two heteronuclear metal complexes, in which Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites are sterically isolated, were synthesized and characterized. These sterically isolated sites exhibited anomalous behavior, wherein the H+ species encapsulated in the Br&#248;nsted acid site did not undergo a deprotonation reaction, and the corresponding protonation reaction at the Br&#248;nsted base site failed to proceed. As a result, two states that are in a relationship of a Br&#248;nsted acid/base pair stably exist over a wide pH range without any interconversion, generating a thermodynamically metastable state. Additionally, these two states exhibited distinct electron transfer abilities and reactivities. The system presented in this study is in sharp contrast with the traditional concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Lowry acids and bases.

         <title>Joining Two Switches in One Nano&#8208;Object: Photoacidity and Photoisomerization in Electrostatic Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

Two switches, three components, quadruple switchability: Tying together two types of anionic molecular switches with cationic macroions by self&#8208;assembly in an aqueous solution results in stable nano&#8208;objects, the size and shape of which can be changed by irradiation with two wavelengths, pH alteration, and darkness.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;switchable supramolecular nano&#8208;objects that respond to irradiation of different wavelengths with changes in size and shape have been built from two different water&#8208;soluble molecular switches, joined by attachment to the same polyelectrolyte. Accordingly, two wavelength&#8208;specific reactions, namely the excited&#8208;state proton dissociation of a photoacid and the cis&#8211;trans isomerization of an azo dye, are combined in one supramolecular nano&#8208;object that is stable in aqueous solution. The concept has potential in the fields of sensors, molecular motors, and transport.

         <title>Woven Polymer Networks: From Crystalline to Elastomeric Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Warp and weft: The duplication of macroscopic woven structures at the molecular level is always an attractive and promising research field. Herein, we summarize the latest advances in constructing woven polymer networks, and further exhibit the structural superiority of woven topology in regulating physical properties of polymeric materials.







Abstract
Weaving technology has been extensively used for manufacturing macroscopic fabrics and satisfying the artistic demands of humans through the ages. Integrating woven geometries into molecular structures is a persistent pursuit, and yet a significant challenge to chemists, owing to the lack of effective methodologies to guide the regular mutual interlacing of molecular strands. In this Concept article, recent progress and related strategies in constructing woven polymer networks (WPNs) are summarized and discussed. An outlook is then given to highlight the future opportunities and challenges in the development of both molecularly woven structures and molecularly woven functional materials.

         <title>Structure Determination of the Crystalline LiPON Model Structure Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x with x&#8776;0.9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x (x&#8776;0.9) is a crystalline compound suitable as model compound for the understanding of structural traits within amorphous LiPON materials. A plethora of analytical methods, including diffraction methods, NMR, vibration spectroscopy and elemental analyses, was employed for elucidation of structure and composition of this substance. Ionic conductivity was measured using impedance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Non&#8208;crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate (LiPON) is used as solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphates are important model structures to retrieve analytical information that can be used to understand amorphous phases better. The new crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x was synthesized as an off&#8208;white powder by ampoule synthesis at 750&#8211;800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c with a=15.13087(11)&#8197;&#197;, b=9.70682(9)&#8197;&#197;, c=8.88681(7)&#8197;&#197;, and &#946;=106.8653(8)&#176;. Two P(O,N)4 tetrahedra connected by an N atom form the structural motif [P2O6&#8722;xN1+x](5+x)&#8722;. The structure was elucidated from X&#8208;ray diffraction data and the model corroborated by NMR and infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analyses.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate (LiPON) is used as solid electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries. Crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphates are important model structures to retrieve analytical information that can be used to understand amorphous phases better. The new crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li&lt;sub&gt;5+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; was synthesized as an off-white powder by ampoule synthesis at 750&#8211;800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=15.13087(11)&#8197;&#197;, &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=9.70682(9)&#8197;&#197;, &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=8.88681(7)&#8197;&#197;, and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;=106.8653(8)&#176;. Two P(O,N)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra connected by an N atom form the structural motif [P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(5+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The structure was elucidated from X-ray diffraction data and the model corroborated by NMR and infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analyses.

         <title>Conformationally Restricted &#946;&#8208;Sheet Breaker Peptides Incorporating Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Methylisoserine Sulfamidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a cyclic sulfamidate moiety as a &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker element is proposed for the first time. The sulfamidate effectively locks the peptide secondary structure in a novel rigid turn both in the gas phase and solid state, which is also maintained in solution. Peptides bearing this motif show moderate amyloid&#8208;&#946; inhibition activity.







Abstract
Peptides containing variations of the &#946;&#8208;amyloid hydrophobic core and five&#8208;membered sulfamidates derived from &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#945;&#8208;methylisoserine have been synthesized and fully characterized in the gas phase, solid state and in aqueous solution by a combination of experimental and computational techniques. The cyclic sulfamidate group effectively locks the secondary structure at the N&#8208;terminus of such hybrid peptides imposing a conformational restriction and stabilizing non&#8208;extended structures. This conformational bias, which is maintained in the gas phase, solid state and aqueous solution, is shown to be resistant to structure templating through assays of in&#8197;vitro &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation, acting as &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker peptides with moderate activity.

         <title>Photoinduced Dehydrogenative Borylation via Dihydrogen Bond Bridged Electron Donor and Acceptor Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptors for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes bridged by a dihydrogen bond. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex SET to give a boron&#8208;centered radical with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator for effective pyridine borylation.







Abstract
Air&#8208;stable amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptor for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest a dihydrogen bond bridging the donor and acceptor. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex single electron transfer to give a boron&#8208;centered radical for dehydrogenative borylation with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator. The deprotonation of Wheland&#8208;like radical intermediate rather than its generation is believed to determine the good ortho&#8208;selectivity based on DFT calculations. A variety of &#945;&#8208;borylated pyridine derivatives have been readily synthesized with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Interplay Between Hydrogen Bonding and Electron Transfer in Mixed Valence Assemblies of Triarylamine Trisamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not only hydrogen bonds but also a specific packing arrangement are necessary to get fast electron transfer in mixed valence assemblies of triarylamine trisamides. Defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long&#8208;range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3&#8208;symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#8722;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FTIR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8901;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen&#8208;bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293&#8197;K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Tantalum Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the tantalum cluster cations catalyze: The cationic tantalum atom and the cationic tetramer exhibit a strong size&#8208;dependent reactivity with methane and carbon dioxide: The monomer yields products from C&#8722;C coupling reactions, while the tetramer enables the formation of formaldehyde or syngas.







Abstract
Understanding molecular&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms is crucial for the design of modern catalysts with industrial prospect. Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH4 and CO2, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta1,4+ ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH4 dehydrogenation [Ta1,4CH2]+ to CO2 in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8722;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH2O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8722;C coupling yielding CH2CO. Selected experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta1,4+ compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.

         <title>Dichromic Allophycocyanin Trimer Covering a Broad Spectral Range (550&#8211;660&#8197;nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When exploring the role of chromophores in phycobilisome assembly, a novel dichromic allophycocyanin was obtained that greatly extends the spectral range for light&#8208;harvesting. A linker contained in the structure is successfully used for template&#8208;assisted assembly in&#8197;vitro. This approach would also allow for targeting, in artificial photosynthetic systems or fluorescence labeling.







Abstract
Phycobilisomes, the light&#8208;harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex superstructure and assembly have been an obstacle. By replacing in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green&#8208;absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red&#8208;absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic&#8208;APC) was obtained. In the small (110&#8197;kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660&#8197;nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting element. Dic&#8208;APC was generated in&#8197;vitro by using the contained core&#8208;linker, LC, for template&#8208;assisted purification and assembly. Labeling the linker provides a method for targeting Dic&#8208;APC.

         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties show intriguing halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon alternative treatments by trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine, the absorption and the fluorescence can be reversibly switched. It is revealed that the introduced proton is on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring.







Abstract
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110&#8197;nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.

         <title>Organometallic Platinum(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been explored to finely tune the electronic properties of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. The complexes were successfully applied as photosensitisers in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion experiments, demonstrating tuneable upconversion quantum yields of up to 14&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for platinum(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (in which C^N=cyclometalating ligand; acac=acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2)&#8197;&#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm (&#1013; &#8776;5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and orange red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em=603&#8211;620&#8197;nm; &#934;em &#8804;37&#8201;%), which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed by microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57&#8201;%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&#934;UC 5.9&#8211;14.1&#8201;%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.

         <title>Homogeneous Dearomative Hydrogenation with a Co/P4N2 Catalyst: A Nucleophilic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes in a nucleophilic manner. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arenes.







Abstract
Arene hydrogenation is the most straightforward method to prepare carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. However, the high resonance energy prevents aromatic substrates from hydrogenation. Herein the homogeneous, nucleophilic hydrogenation of less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes is reported. The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to the cyano (hetero)arene substrates. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the catalytically active CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arene substrates. An outlook for the synthesis of more challenging substituted benzenes was proposed based on the in&#8197;silico modification of the CoH species.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Mediated Regioselective Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization via an Aryl BF2 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes N&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes has been achieved. The reaction proceeds via a BBr3 promoted 5 and 6&#8208;membered boracycle that undergoes a ligand exchange promoted by Selectfluor to give a previously scarce aryl BF2 species. The aryl BF2 is a bench stable intermediate that can be used for the deborylative functionalization of the 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes scaffold.







Abstract
An efficient regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes via an azaaryl BF2 complex has been developed. Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF2 in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross&#8208;couplings.

Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late-stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross-couplings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds Bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>

Electronic tuning of ground&#8208;state structures for tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species has been achieved by changing electronic properties of the equatorial aryl groups on the central carbon, confirmed by a correlation between Hammett para&#8208;substituent constant and solid&#8208;state structures of a series of cationic species based on a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7 tricyclic framework.







Abstract
To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton with sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of para substituents (R=Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe) of the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R=H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208; and methyl&#8208;derivatives were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the p&#8208;MeO and thioxanthenyl system were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8722;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These findings amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence of the hypervalent apical 3c&#8211;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.

         <title>Probing the Importance of Host Symmetry on Carbohydrate Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple switch from formic acid to HFIP allows the formation of the C3 symmetrical hemicryptophane cage analogue of the previously reported C1 symmetrical one. The cage with low symmetry exhibits higher binding constants towards carbohydrates than the C3 analogue. The receptors showed remarkable high substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity towards &#945;&#8208;glucoside and &#946;&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
The design of molecular cages with low symmetry could allow for more specific tuning of their properties and better mimic the unsymmetrical and complex environment of protein pockets. However, the added value of lowering symmetry of molecular receptors has been rarely demonstrated. Herein, C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;symmetrical cages, presenting the same recognition sites, have been synthesized and investigated as hosts for carbohydrate recognition. Structurally related derivatives of glucose, galactose and mannose were found to have greater affinity to the receptor with the lowest symmetry than to their C3&#8208;symmetrical analogue. According to the host cavity modelling, the C1 symmetry receptor exhibits a wider opening than its C3&#8208;symmetrical counterpart, providing easier access and thus promoting guest proximity to binding sites. Moreover, our results show the high stereo&#8208; and substrate selectivity of the C1 symmetry cage with respect to its C3 counterpart in the recognition of sugars.

         <title>Recent Advances on High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type and spinel&#8208;type NaxMnO2 (NMO) are reviewed. High&#8208;capacity NMOs and strategies to improve capacity are introduced and discussed in detail. The future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.







Abstract
Sodium manganese&#8208;based oxides (NMO) are attracting huge attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). To date, one of the most important challenges of NMO&#8208;based cathodes is the relatively low capacity. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Great efforts have been made to enhance the reversible capacity of NMO&#8208;based cathodes, achieving considerable progress not only on electrochemical performance, but also the mechanism of massive sodium ion storage. In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of NMO are reviewed, including P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type, and spinel&#8208;type NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Strategies for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes, such as cationic substitution, anion redox activation, etc are introduced in detail. Last but not least, the future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;Linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ganging up on bacteria: Siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for the activation of an antibacterial prodrug within cells. A fluoroquinolone prodrug was developed and shown to be compatible with the catalysts under micro&#8208;aerobic, biologically relevant conditions. The co&#8208;addition of the catalysts and prodrug to E.&#8197;coli showed a combinative effect, with the dihydroxybenzoic acid&#8208; and azotochelin&#8208;linked catalysts showing most promise for cellular uptake and thus intracellular prodrug activation.







Abstract
Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules called siderophores that are released by bacteria to acquire iron have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised, and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whereas a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines. By employing complementary bacterial growth assays, conjugates containing siderophore units based on catechol and azotochelin were found to be most promising for intracellular prodrug activation.

         <title>Stabilization of Potent Co(II)&#8208;based Lewis Acids with Weakly Basic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tame, but not too much. Complexation of Co(II) with weakly Lewis&#8208;basic ligands yields complexes with calculated Fluoride Ion Affinity in CH2Cl2 solution comparable to SbF5 &#8208; a benchmark for Lewis superacidity. Stabilization with weakly coordinating anion {Al[OC(CF3)3]4}&#8722; allows isolation of such complexes in the form of easily storable salts and their thorough characterization.







Abstract
Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis&#8208;acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)&#8208;WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO2, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis&#8208;acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF5 according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.

         <title>Towards Luminescent Vanadium(II) Complexes with Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Quantum Coherence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards qubits with optical read&#8208;out: Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (4MLCT) states account for the color of the vanadium(II) complex isomers cis&#8208;fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[V(ddpd)2]2+ in spite of the electron&#8208;rich pyridines. 2MLCT states mix with the lowest spin&#8208;flip states, contracting the V&#8722;N bonds in the excited state and preventing ruby&#8208;like spin&#8208;flip emission. Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K.The mer isomer shows slow magnetic relaxation in an external magnetic field. These results pave the way for qubits with optical read&#8208;out based on vanadium(II) complexes.







Abstract
Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35&#8197;GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400&#8197;mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.

         <dc:description>
A reductive amination&#8208;&#8220;nitrogen deletion&#8221; reaction sequence employing (hetero)aromatic aldehydes and (het)arylmethyl amines as the building blocks, and anomeric amide as the reagent was implemented for the parallel synthesis of compound libraries. The method gave access to a chemical space of over half a million compounds relevant to early drug&#8208;discovery initiatives.







Abstract
A protocol for parallel C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes and (hetero)arylmethyl amines based on a reductive amination &#8211; &#8220;nitrogen deletion&#8221; reaction sequence has been developed. After preliminary validation experiments, an illustrative compound library of 25&#8197;members was prepared with 76&#8201;% synthetic efficiency. The estimated chemical space accessible by the proposed approach covers almost 600&#8201;000&#8197;representatives that are scarcely represented in current compound databases.

         <title>Coupling Value&#8208;Added Anodic Reactions with Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction is a promising strategy to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals. In this review, recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential anodic reactions are summarized. Current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are also proposed.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction features a promising approach to realize carbon neutrality. However, its competitiveness is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which consumes a large portion of energy. Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction has been emerging as a promising strategy in recent years to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals at both cathode and anode of the electrolyzer. This review briefly summarizes recent progresses on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the economic feasibility of different CO2 electrolysis systems is discussed. Then a comprehensive summary of recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential value&#8208;added anodic reactions is provided, with special focus on the specific cell designs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are proposed, which are targeted to facilitate progress in this field and push the CO2 electrolyzers to a more practical level.

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand design has a strong impact on the surface activity of organometallic complexes. Complementing the ligand system of a Pt complex with fluorinated groups triggers strong enrichment at the IL/vacuum interface in IL solution in a buoy&#8208;like fashion, which was studied by ARXPS.







Abstract
The targeted enrichment of a Pt complex with an ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;derived ligand system in IL solution is demonstrated by using angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When the ligand system is complemented with fluorinated side chains, the complex accumulates strongly at the IL/gas interface, while in an equivalent solution of a complex without these substituents no such effect could be observed. This buoy&#8208;like behavior induces strong population of the complex at the outermost molecular layer close to surface saturation, which was studied over a range from 5 to 30&#8201;%mol. The surface enrichment was found to be most efficient at the lowest concentration, which is particularly favorable for catalytic applications such as supported ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;phase (SILP) catalysis.

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>

Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective arylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. Remarkably, the regioselectivity in the cyclization of conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes can be controlled by a choice of the phosphine ligand, with triphenylphosphine and tricyclohexylphosphine leading to the exclusive formation of 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol and 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol derivatives, respectively.







Abstract
Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, that is, the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination (&#8220;anti&#8208;Wacker&#8221;&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.

&lt;p&gt;Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, that is, the nucleophilic attack of electron-rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination (&#8220;anti-Wacker&#8221;-type cyclization). With regard to 5-alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl- or alkynyl-substituted ones to afford 2-cyclohexen-1-ol and 2-alkylidene-cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6-alkyl- or 6-aryl-5-alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne-aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
