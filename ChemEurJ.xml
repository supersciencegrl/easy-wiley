         <title>Using the Interaction between Copper and Manganese to Stabilize Copper Single&#8208;atom for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between Cu and Mn was utilized to immobilize Cu single&#8208;atom on MnO2  surface by redox&#8208;driven hydrolysis method. Comprehensive structure and properties characterization demonstrate that the existence of Cu&#8208;Mn interaction on the catalyst surface can effectively restrain the aggregation of Cu single atoms and improve CO oxidation activity. The interaction of forming Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Mn entity is beneficial for CO catalytic activity since the migration of reactive oxygen species and the coordination effect of active centers accelerate the reaction. In particular, 3%&#8208;Cu1/MnO2  shows the more 10&#8208;fold oxygen storage capacity (OSC) value (342.75 &#956;mol/g) than pure MnO2  (27.79 &#956;mol/g) and performs the high activity of CO ( T90% = 80  oC), it can retain CO conversion of 95% after 15 times circulation. This work offers a reliable method for synthesizing Cu SACs and deepens the understanding of the interaction effect between transition metal single&#8208;atom and support that can improve the catalytic activity of CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Disorder Induces Unusual Phase Transition in a Potential 2D Chiral Ferroelectric Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites with single chiral and ferroelectricity together with various structural phase transitions provide the possibility for them to have more diverse functional properties. Here, we present a 2D chiral hybrid halide perovskite ferroelectric, [C  6  H  5  (CH  2  )  4  NH  3  ]  2  CdCl  4  (  4PBA&#8208;CdCl  4  ,  4PBA  = 4&#8208;Phenylbutylamine), which experiences two continuous phase transitions from centrosymmetric triclinic  P  &#160; to polar chiral monoclinic  P  2 and then to another centrosymmetric tetragonal  P  4  /mmm  with increasing temperature, accompanied by symmetry breaking, due to the prominent octahedral distortion and disorder transformation of organic  4PBA  cations. Under polar chiral phase,  4PBA&#8208;CdCl  4  exhibits a significant CD signal and a moderate ferroelectric polarization of 0.35 &#956;C/cm  2  . In addition,  4PBA&#8208;CdCl  4  occupies a wide band gap of 4.376 eV and is chiefly contributed by inorganic CdCl  6  octahedron. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new phase transitions and related physical properties in hybrid halide perovskites and other hybrid crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel/Cobalt Molybdate  Hollow&#160;rods  Induced by Structure and Defect  Engineering as  Exceptional Electrode Materials  for  Hybrid &#160;Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface&#8208;controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects (D&#8208;H&#8208;NiMoO  4  @CoMoO  4  ) via a soft&#8208;template and partial reduction method, enhancing D&#8208;H&#8208;NiMoO  4  @CoMoO  4  &#8217;s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329 F g  &#8208;1  , and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8% capacity retention after 3000 cycles. D&#8208;H&#8208;NiMoO  4  @CoMoO  4  &#160;was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13 W h kg  &#8208;1  &#160;and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects as pseudo&#8208;capacitor material for high&#8208;performance capacitive energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Tetrahedranes Containing the Unique Bridging Hetero&#8208;Dipnictogen Ligand EE' (E &#8800;&#160;E'&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb, Bi)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to improve and extend the rare class of tetrahedral mixed main group transition metal compounds, a new synthetic route for the complexes [{CpMo(CO)  2  }  2  (&#181;,&#951;  2  :&#951;  2  &#8208;  PE  )] (E = As (  1  ), Sb (  2  )) is described leading to higher yields and a decrease in reaction steps. Via this route, also the so far unknown heavier analogues containing  AsSb  (  3a  ),  AsBi  (  4  ) and  SbBi  (  5  ) ligands, respectively, are accessible.  Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and DFT calculations reveal that they represent very rare examples of compounds comprising covalent bonds between two different heavy pnictogen atoms,  which show multiple bond character and are stabilised without any organic substituents. &#160;  A simple one&#8208;pot reaction of [CpMo(CO)  2  ]  2  with ME(SiMe  3  )  2  (M = Li, K; E = P, As, Sb, Bi) and the subsequent addition of PCl  3  , AsCl  3  , SbCl  3  or BiCl  3  , respectively, give the complexes  1  &#8211;  5  . This synthesis is also transferable to the already known homo&#8208;dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)  2  }  2  (&#181;,&#951;  2  :&#951;  2  &#8208;  E  2  )] (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) resulting in higher yields comparable to those in the literature procedures and allows the introduction of the bulkier and better soluble Cp' (Cp' = tert butylcyclopentadienyl) ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation methodology for hydrogen isotope exchange of aromatic carbonyl compounds is presented. In the presence of catalytic amounts of specific amine additives, a transient directing group is formed  in situ  , which directs selective deuteration. A high degree of deuteration is achieved for  &#945;&#8208;  carbonyl and aromatic  ortho&#8208;  positions. In addition, appropriate choice of conditions allows for exclusive labeling of the  &#945;&#8208;  carbonyl position while a procedure for the preparation of merely  ortho  &#8208;deuterated compounds is also reported. This methodology proceeds with good functional group tolerance and can be also applied for deuteration of pharmaceutical drugs. Mechanistic studies reveal a kinetic isotope effect of 2.2, showing that the C&#8208;H activation is likely the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic cycle. Using deuterium oxide as a cheap and convenient source of deuterium, the methodology presents a cost&#8208;efficient alternative to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iridium&#8208;catalyzed procedures.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new hypervalent&#8208;iodine(III) mediated tandem reaction involving oxidative dearomatization and in situ aziridination of phenolic amines is described, providing a mild and effective method for the assembly of structurally interesting and synthetically useful aziridines. Importantly, the densely functionalized aziridines resulting from this unprecedented tandem reaction offer a platform for the expeditious access to architecturally diverse aza&#8208;heterocycles through transformations initiated by selective ring&#8208;opening of aziridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Functionalizable Unsymmetrically&#8208; and Symmetrically&#8208;Substituted Triarylboranes from Bench&#8208;Stable Boron Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and convenient methodology for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sterically congested triarylboranes, using bench&#8208;stable aryltrifluoroborates as the boron source, is reported. This new procedure gives systematic access to symmetrically&#8208; and unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted triarylboranes of the types BAr  2  Ar&#8217; and BArAr&#8217;Ar&#8217;&#8217;, respectively. Four unsymmetrically&#8208;substituted triarylboranes, as well as their iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H borylation products, are reported. These borylated triarylboranes contain at least one and up to three positions that can subsequently be orthogonally functionalized in follow up reactions, such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings or Sonogashira couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions on a 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Moiety of a Fullerene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety embedded in a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative was examined to produce &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl, and acid anhydride compounds. The former two showed a significantly supressed encapsulation/escape dynamics of a water molecule as well as electrochemical properties largely different from the last one.







Abstract
A 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety on a cage&#8208;opened fullerene skeleton is one of suitable building blocks for the further derivatization. Herein, we discuss the chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compound into &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, acid anhydride, and &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives. Despite possessing a sterically small methylene unit in the last one, the release of an encapsulated water molecule was significantly supressed whereas the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide bearing three bulky p&#8208;tolyl groups on the P&#8208;atom enabled the faster insertion/release dynamics, implying the flexibility of the phosphonium substituent. The replacement of the carbonyl group with phosphorus ylide and methylene units largely varied electrochemical properties of the fullerene skeleton, likely arising from the anionic charge delocalized over the entire molecule and removal of an electron&#8208;withdrawable carbonyl group, respectively.

         <title>Double&#8208;Network Heparin Dynamic Hydrogels: Dynagels as Anti&#8208;bacterial 3D Cell Culture Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent dynagels for heparin encapsulation: Dynamic covalently cross&#8208;linked dynamers with high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and self&#8208;healing behaviors have been used for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Double cross&#8208;linked dynamic hydrogels, dynagels, have been prepared through reversible imine bonds and supramolecular interactions, which showed good pH responsiveness, injectability, self&#8208;healing property and biocompatibility. With the further encapsulation of heparin, the obtained hydrogels exhibited good anti&#8208;bacterial activity and promotion effects for 3D cell culture.

         <title>Shape&#8208;adaptability and redox&#8208;switching properties of a di&#8208;gold metallotweezer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the use of a carbazolyl&#8208;connected di&#8208;gold(I) metallotweezer for the encapsulation of several electronpoor organic substrates, and a planar Au(III) complex containing a CNC pincer ligand. The binding affinity of the receptor depends on the electron&#8208;deficient character of the planar guest, with larger association constants found for the more electronpoor guests. The X&#8208;ray diffraction molecular structures of two host:guest adducts, shows that the host approaches its arms in order to facilitate the optimum interaction with the surface of the planar guests, in a clear example of an guest&#8208;induced fit conformational arrangement. The electrochemical studies of the encapsulation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxy diimide (NTCDI) show that the redox active guest is released from the receptor upon one electron reduction, thus constituting an example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic POM Electrocatalyst Achieves Low Voltage &#8220;Charge&#8221; in Zn&#8208;air Battery Coupled with Bisphenol A Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;air battery is a perspective power source for grid&#8208;storage. But, after they are discharged at 1.1 to 1.2 V, large overpotential is required for their charging, usually 2.5 V. This is due to sluggish the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); Incorporating organic pollutants into the cathode electrolyte is a feasible strategy for lowering the required charging potential. On the other hand, in discharge process related oxygen reduction reaction, hydrophobic electrocatalyst is more popular than hydrophilic one. Here, a hydrophobic bi&#8208;functional polyoxometalate electrocatalyst is synthesized by precise structural design. It shows excellent activities in both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions. In bisphenol A containing electrolyte, to achieve 100 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , its potential is only 1.32 V, which is 0.34 V lower than oxygen evolution reaction. In oxygen reduction reaction, this electrocatalyst follows four&#8208;electron mechanism. In both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions, it shows excellent stability. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and bisphenol A containing KOH as electrolyte, Zn&#8208;air battery is assembled. When &#8220;charge&#8221; at 85 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , it only requires 1.98 V. Peak power density of this Zn&#8208;air battery reaches 120.5 mW&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . More importantly, in &#8220;charge&#8221; process, bisphenol A is degraded, which achieves energy saving and pollutants removal simultaneously in one Zn&#8208;air battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulation of Next Generation Multi&#8208;Compartment Microcapsules by Reversible Electrostatic Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combination of several active substances in one carrier is often limited due to the solubility, stability and phase separation issues. These issues are addressed by an innovative capsule design, in which nanocapsules are assembled on the microcapsule surface by electrostatic forces forming a pH responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system. Here, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules with a negative surface charge were synthesized and coated with novel MF&#8208;polyethyleneimine (PEI) copolymer to achieve a positive charge of &#950; = + 28 mV. This novel coating procedure allows the electrostatic assembly of negatively charged poly&#8208;L&#8208;lactide (PLLA, &#950; = &#8208; 19 mV) and poly&#8208;(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) (PLGA, &#950; = &#8208; 56 mV) nanocapsules on the microcapsule surface. Assembly studies at pH 7 gave a partial surface coverage of PLLA nanocapsules and full surface coverage for PLGA nanocapsules. The pH responsive adsorption and desorption of nanocapsules was shown at pH 7 and pH 3.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Preparation of CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 Nanocomposite s as High&#8208;performance C athode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as a promising energy storage device due to their high energy density and high safety, but they still suffer from the lack of cathode with high&#8208;rate performance and cycle performance. Herein, CuCo  2  S  4  /Cu  7.2  S  4  composites with nano&#8208;sized were first synthesized by a facile solvothermal method in this work and the magnesium ion storage behaviour was discussed when applied in the cathode for RMBs. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the CuCo  2  S  4  /Cu  7.2  S  4  composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 256 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 10 mA g  &#8208;1  and 123 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  at room temperature and an outstanding long&#8208;term cyclic stability over 300 cycles at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  . Furthermore, the electrochemical storage mechanism demonstrated that the storage process of magnesium ion in the CuCo  2  S  4  /Cu  7.2  S  4  cathode is mainly driven by the strong pseudocapacitive effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity of L&#8208;threonine Aldolase for Synthesis of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine by Modulating Substrate&#8208;binding Pocket for Orientation Control of Substrate Entrance</title>

         <dc:description>L&#8208;threonine aldolase form Actinocorallia herbida (AhLTA) is an ideal catalyst for producing L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine [(2S, 3R)&#8208;1b], a key chiral precursor for florfenicol and thiamphenicol. The moderate C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity is the main obstacle for the industrial application of AhLTA. To address this issue, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) joined with sequence&#160;conservatism&#160;analysis were applied to engineer the AhLTA toward improved C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. The optical mutant Y314R could asymmetrically synthesize L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine with 81% de (diastereomeric excess), which is 23% higher than wild&#8208;type AhLTA. Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations have revealed that the mechanism for C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity improvement of Y314R is due to the acylamino group of residues Arg314 controlling the orientation of substrate 4&#8208;methylsulphonyl benzaldehyde (1a) into the active pocket by directed interaction with the methylsulphonyl group, which leads to asymmetric synthesis of L&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine. The success in the present study demonstrates that direct control of substrates into an active pocket is an attract strategy to address C&#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity problem of LTA, which contributes to the industrial application of LTA.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hierarchical Porous Framework with High Conductivity and its Application in Lithium Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quick capacity loss due to the polysulfide shuttle effects and poor rate performance caused by low conductivity of sulfur have always been obstacles to the commercial application of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein, an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with high electron&#8208;ion conductivity and adjustable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, the resulting material has a specific surface area of 2124.9 m  2  g  &#8208;1  and a cumulative pore volume of 1.19 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  . The presence of micropores can effectively physically adsorb polysulfides and mesopores ensure the accessibility of lithium ions and active sites, and give the porous carbon material a high specific surface area. The large pores provide channels for the storage of electrolyte and the transmission of ions on the surface of the substrate. The combined effect of these three kinds of pores and the N doping formed in&#8208;situ can effectively promote the cycle and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616 mAh g  &#8208;1  at a rate of 5 C. After 400 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 1 C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  . This new strategy has provided a new approach to the research and industrial&#8208;scale production of adjustable hierarchical porous biochar materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular sieving of acetylene from ethylene in a rigid ultramicroporous metal organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rigid molecular sieving materials are the ideal candidates for gas separation (e.g. C2H2/C2H4) due to their ultrahigh adsorption selectivity and absence of gas co&#8208;adsorption. However, the absolute molecular sieving effect for C2H2/C2H4 separation has rarely been realized because of their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we demonstrate the absolute molecular sieving of C2H2 from C2H4 by a rigid ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework (F&#8208;PYMO&#8208;Cu) with 1D regular channels (pore size of c.a. 3.4 &#197;). F&#8208;PYMO&#8208;Cu exhibited moderate acetylene uptake (35.5 cm3/ cm3), but very low ethylene uptake (0.55 cm3/ cm3) at 298 K and 1 bar, yielding the second highest C2H2/C2H4 uptake ratio of 63.6 up to now. One&#8208;step C2H4 production from the binary mixture of C2H2/C2H4 and the ternary mixture of C2H2/CO2/C2H4 at 298 K was achieved and verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Coupled with excellent thermal and water stability, F&#8208;PYMO&#8208;Cu could be a promising candidate for industry&#8208;related C2 separation tasks.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning J&#8208;aggregate Formation and Emission Efficiency in Cationic Diazapentacenium Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancement of the luminescence efficiency of two new diazapentacenium salts (  D1  and  D2  ) of more than 55 for  D1  and 22 times for  D2  ) in poor solvents, acetonitrile and/or dichloromethane, was observed and rationalized as formation of emissive J&#8208;aggregates. Both compounds displaying 4&#8208;  n  &#8208;decylphenyl substituents at the 7,14&#8208;carbons and phenyl (  D1  ) or 2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl (  D2  ) substituents at the quaternary nitrogens in 5,12&#8208;positions have been synthetized in a two&#8208;step procedure involving a two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig&#8208;type CN cross&#8208;coupling and an electrophilic Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type cyclization. The optical properties of the dicationic diazapentacenium salts in various solvents and in thin films have been investigated by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. In thin films and in good solvents, isolated molecules coexist with aggregates. Nonetheless,  D1  is 7 times more emissive than  D2,  reflecting a higher J&#8208;aggregate contribution in the former.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Structural Assignments Underlying R.&#8197;B. Woodward's Most Personal Data That Led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Rules: Subramania Ranganathan's Key Role and Related Research by E.&#8197;J. Corey and A.&#8197;G. Hortmann</title>

In 1963 and early 1964, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B12. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of 1H&#8197;NMR parameters.







Abstract
In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B12, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the 1H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.

         <dc:description>Fluorenyl cations are text book examples of 4&#960; electron antiaromatic five&#8208;membered ring systems. So far, they were reported only as short&#8208;lived intermediates generated under superacidic conditions or by flash photolysis. Our attempt to prepare a m&#8208;terphenyl acylium cation by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride, gave rise to an isolable 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed by an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Desepoxy&#8208;Tedanolide C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of one isomer of the marine natural product tedanolide C was accomplished and provides evidence about the relative configuration of this member of the tedanolide family. The synthesis takes advantage of a variant of the Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. The synthesis was particularly sensitive to the appropriate selection of protecting groups, which made constant protecting group switches necessary. The spectroscopic data of the synthesized isomer support a different configuration than the originally proposed one.







Abstract
The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C was accomplished and provided experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination were used to assemble the carbon framework.

Chemical synthesis of a Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide was achieved by a [4+1] post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone, through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.

         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow fluorescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>A Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Conjugated to a Coumarin Derivative Is a Potent Photodynamic Agent against Prostate Differentiated and Tumorigenic Cancer Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cyclometalated IrIII complex conjugated to a far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting coumarin, IrIII&#8211;COUPY (3), was recently shown as a very promising photosensitizer suitable for photodynamic therapy of cancer. Conventional anticancer chemotherapies exhibit several disadvantages, such as limited efficiency to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are considered the main reason for chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Herein, we show, using DU145 tumor cells, taken as the model of hormone&#8208;refractory and aggressive prostate cancer cells resistant to conventional antineoplastic drugs, that the photoactivated 3 very efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk, differentiated and prostate, hardly treatable CSCs simultaneously and with a similar efficiency. Notably, the very low toxicity of IrIII&#8211;COUPY conjugate in the prostate DU145 cells in the dark and its pronounced selectivity for tumor cells compared with noncancerous cells could result in low side effects and reduced damage of healthy cells during the photoactivated therapy by this agent. Moreover, the experiments performed with the 3D spheroids formed from DU145 CSCs showed that conjugate 3 can penetrate the inner layers of tumorspheres, which might markedly increase its therapeutic effect. Notably, this conjugate induces apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer DU145 cells associated with calcium signaling flux in these cells and autophagy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a photoactivatable metal&#8208;based compound is an efficient agent capable of killing even hardly treatable prostatic CSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement Inside a Crystalline Sponge Induces Pyrrole to Form N&#8208;H&#8230;&#960; Bonded Tetramers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the DFT&#8208;level calculated molecular volume (V  mol  ) of pyrrole and its liquid density, pyrrole manifests the highest liquid density coefficient LD  c  (defined as [V  mol  &#8226; density &#8226; 0.6023]/FW) value of 0.7. Normal liquids have LD  c  &lt; 0.63. This very high LD  c  is due to the strong N&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#960; interactions in solution and hence pyrrole can be considered to be a pseudo&#8208;crystalline liquid. When trapped inside the confined space of the crystalline sponge a reorientation of the N&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#960; interaction is observed leading to specific cyclic N&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#960; tetramers and N&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#960; dimers, verified by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational methods. These tetramers are of the same size as four pyrrole molecules in the solid&#8208;state of pyrrole, yet the cyclic N&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#960; intermolecular interactions are circularly oriented instead of the linear zig&#8208;zag structure found in the X&#8208;ray structure of a solid pyrrole. The confinement thus acts as an external driving force for the tetramer formation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A double helicene with a spiro&#8208;Si linker (  4  ) was synthesized by four successive nucleophilic substitutions on SiCl  4  . Its (  P,P  ), (  M,M  ) and (  P,M  ) isomers were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the central spirosilabi[fluorene] moiety, the two helicene units in  4  are symmetrically and nearly perpendicularly arranged. (  P,P  )&#8208;  4  and (  M,M  )&#8208;  4  exhibit unique optical properties attributable to the LUMO spiro&#8208;conjugation between the two sila[7]helicene units.</dc:description>

New visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable solvatochromic fluorescent label for light&#8208;up and colour&#8208;change sensing of DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine and its 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate bearing solvatochromic acetophenyl&#8208;thienyl&#8208;aniline fluorophore was developed using the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key step. The triphosphate was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA. The labelled nucleotide or DNA exerted weak red fluorescence when excited at 405&#8197;nm, but a significant colour change (to yellow or green) and light&#8208;up (up to 20 times) was observed when the DNA probes interacted with proteins or lipids.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate for the first time that heterojunction nanowires consisting of a gradient and segmented&#8208;like heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core with controllable length, composition and morphology can be generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding of oligo(  p  &#8208;phenylene vinylene) (OPV)&#8208; and oligo(  p  &#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (OPE)&#8208;containing block copolymers in despite of different chain lengths and molecular conformation for OPE and OPV. More importantly, on the basis of understanding about the formation of heterogeneous core by the co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding approach, we develop a &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221; seeded growth route, by which linear and branched heterojunction nanowires containing a segmented heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology can be obtained. This work provides a versatile platform to generate heterojunction nanowires with excellent controllability in length, composition and morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Nanoaggregates of Sialylated Biohybrid Photosensitizers for Intracellular Activation of the Photodynamic Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the endeavor of extending the clinical use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of superficial cancers and other neoplastic diseases, deeper knowledge and control on the subcellular processes that determine the response of photosensitizers (PS) are needed. Recent strategies in this direction involve the use of activatable and nanostructured PS. Herein both capacities have been tuned in two dendritic zinc (II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) derivatives, either asymmetrically or symmetrically substituted with 3 and 12 copies of the carbohydrate sialic acid (SA), respectively. Interestingly, the amphiphilic ZnPc&#8208;SA biohybrid (1) self&#8208;assembles into well&#8208;defined nanoaggregates in aqueous solution, facilitating cellular internalization and transport while the PS remains inactive. Within the cells, this nanostructured hybrid localizes in the lysosomes, as it usually happens for anionic and hydrophilic aggregated PS. Yet, in contrast to most of them (e.g., compound 2), hybrid 1 recovers the capacity for photoinduced ROS generation within the target organelles due to its amphiphilic character, which allows disruption of aggregation when it gets inserted into the lysosomal membrane, with the concomitant highly efficient PDT response.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(Iminophosphorano)&#8208;Substituted Pyridinium Ions and their Corresponding Bispyridinylidene Organic Electron Donors**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimized synthetic procedures for pyridinium ions featuring iminophosphorano (&#8208;N=PR3  ; R = Ph, Cy) &#960;&#8208;donor substituents in the 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; positions are described. Crystallographic and theoretical studies reveal that the strongly donating substituents severely polarize the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the pyridyl ring at the expense of aromaticity. Moreover, the pyridinium ions are readily deprotonated to generate powerful bispyridinylidene (BPY) organic electron donors. Electrochemical studies show exceptionally low redox potentials for the two&#8208;electron BPY/BPY2+  couples, ranging from &#8208;1.71 V vs the saturated calomel electrode for  3PhPh  (with four Ph3P=N&#8208; groups) to &#8208;1.85 V for  3CyCy  (with four Cy3P=N&#8208; groups). These new compounds represent the most reducing neutral organic electron donors (OEDs) currently known. Some preliminary reductions involving  3CyCy  showed enhanced capability owing to its low redox potential, such as the thermally activated reduction of an aryl chloride, but purification challenges were often encountered.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unusual Photochromic and Hydrochromic Switching Behavior of Cellulose&#8208;Embedded 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide&#8208;Viologen Derivatives in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive chromic materials such as photochromes, hydrochromes, thermochromes, and electrochromes have a long history of capturing the attention of scientists due to their potential industrial applications and novelty in popular culture. However, hybrid chromic materials that combine two or more stimuli&#8208;triggered color changing properties are not so well known. Herein, we report a design strategy that has led to a series of emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;viologen dyads which exhibit unusual dual photochromic and hydrochromic switching behavior in the solid&#8208;state when embedded in a cellulose matrix. This behavior manifests as reversible solid state fluorescence hydrochromism upon changes in relative humidity&#160;and reversible solid state photochromism upon generation of a cellulose&#8208;stabilized viologen radical cation. In this design strategy, the bipyridinium unit serves as a water&#8208;sensitive receptor for the hydrochromic fluorophore&#8208;receptor system, and a photochromic group&#160;capable of eliciting its own visible colorimetric response, generating an emission quenching radical cation with exposure to UV&#160;light. These dyes can be inkjet&#8208;printed onto cellulose paper or drop&#8208;cast as cellulose powder&#8208;based films and can be unidirectionally cycled between three states which can be visualized under UV light or visible light. The material&#8217;s photochromism, hydrochromism, and underlying mechanism of action was investigated using computational analysis, dynamic vapor sorption isotherms, EPR&#160;spectroscopy, and variable humidity UV&#8208;Vis adsorption and fluorescence spectroscopies.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Electronic Communication in Linearly Elongated Rylenes Featuring Tunable Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modified synthetic pathway towards perylene&#8208;perylene&#8208;dimers and a facile purification method to obtain the regioisomerically pure  syn  &#8208; and  anti  &#8208;isomers are reported. In addition, a novel perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 conjugated  &#960;  &#8208;electron pairs was designed and synthesized on the basis of a previously described precursor and the resulting regioisomers were separated from each other. Thereby, the opto&#8208;electronic properties of the linearly elongated chromophores could be investigated regarding the differences in length of their aromatic system and the configuration of the isomers. Further tuning of their energy gaps was realized  via  protonation and methylation of the dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit. Extraordinary red&#8208;shifts of the absorption maxima of 62 nm for the methylated and 92 nm for the protonated perylene&#8208;perylene  anti  &#8208;isomer could be achieved. Moreover, the maxima for the  syn  &#8208;isomer could be shifted bathochromically by 87 and 113 nm, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free &#945; Csp3&#8722;H Cyanation of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash chromatography column free and transition metal free cyanation of &#945; C&#8722;H sulfonylamide was developed to access valuable &#945;&#8208;amino cyanation products from a variety of fluorine masked sulfonylamides. Compared with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and occurs under mild conditions. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron allows for excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8722;F sulfonylamides, which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines, are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction is also characterized by broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free workup. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron pathway to generate imines through manipulation of the leaving group allows us to achieve excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Rhodium Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent and CPL Active Dispiroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of chiral [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) was achieved for the first time in good yields with high e.r. values (e.r. up to 99:1). The crucial step of the whole reaction sequence was enantioselective intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols to indenofluorenediols that was catalyzed by a Rh/SEGPHOS  &#174;  complex. Further transformations lead to the corresponding DSF&#8208;IFs. The prepared helically chiral DSF&#8208;IFs combine circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity (  g  lum  = ~10  &#8208;3  ) with exceptionally high fluorescence quantum yields (up to &#934;  lum  = 0.97).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach&#160;to Multi&#8208;Layer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality has been achieved via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. New chiral catalysts were designed and screened under various catalytic systems that proved chiral amide&#8208;phosphines to be more efficient ligands than other candidates. The multi&#8208;layer 3D framework was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray structural analysis showing a parallel pattern of three layers consisting top, middle and bottom aromatic rings. X&#8208;ray structure of a catalyst complex, dichloride complex of Pd&#8208;phosphine amide, was obtained revealing an interesting asymmetric environment nearby Pd metal center. Three rings of multi&#8208;layer 3D products can be readily changed by varying aromatic ring&#8208;anchored starting materials.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality has been achieved via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. New chiral catalysts were designed and screened under various catalytic systems that proved chiral amide&#8208;phosphines to be more efficient ligands than other candidates. The multi&#8208;layer 3D framework was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray structural analysis showing a parallel pattern of three layers consisting top, middle and bottom aromatic rings. X&#8208;ray structure of a catalyst complex, dichloride complex of Pd&#8208;phosphine amide, was obtained revealing an interesting asymmetric environment nearby Pd metal center. Three rings of multi&#8208;layer 3D products can be readily changed by varying aromatic ring&#8208;anchored starting materials. The resulting multi&#8208;layer products displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). This work would benefit not only asymmetric chemistry but also materials science, particularly, polarized organic electronics, optoelectrics and photovoltaics in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Electroactivity in a Covalent&#8208;Organic Network with Mechanically Interlocked Pillar[5]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a polyrotaxanated covalent&#8208;organic network (CON) based on the association between the viologen and pillar[5]arene (P[5]OH) units is reported. The mechanical bond allows for the irreversible insertion of n&#8208;type redox centers (P[5]OH macrocycles) within a pristine structure based on p&#8208;type viologen redox centers. Both redox units are active on a narrow potential range and, in water, the presence of P[5]OH greatly increases the electroactivity of the material.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.g., below 5 nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. Herein, we present the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3 nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Diindenopyrazines: Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the syntheses, properties and application of air stable, electron acceptors, the diindenopyrazines  4a&#8208;g  . We demonstrate introduction of functional aryl groups in 6,12&#8208;position. The targets are accessible on the hundred milligrams to the gram scale. The structure of the aryl groups in  4a&#8208;g  modulate the solubility, redox potentials and optical properties. Introduction of electron poor aryl groups to the electron poor diindenopyrazine backbone reduces the electron affinity to &#8209;4&#160;eV, attractive as n&#8209;semiconductors. A simple organic field&#8208;effect transistor &#8208; without optimization &#8208; of  4e  shows electron transport with a mobility of up to 0.037 cm  2  /Vs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Foaming Metal&#8208;Organic Gels Based on Phytic Acid and Their Mechanical, Moldable and Load&#8208;Bearing Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalogue of metal&#8208;organic gels are synthesized from phytic acid (PA) and a diversity of metal ions (Fe  3+  , Cr  3+  , Al  3+  , Ce  3+  , Y  3+  , Co  2+  , Ni  2+  , Mn  2+  , Cu  2+  , Zn  2+  , Mg  2+  ) upon heating at 80  o  C. PA&#8208;M gels have various morphologies, including irregular granular (PA&#8208;Fe, PA&#8208;Al, PA&#8208;Ce, PA&#8208;Cr, PA&#8208;Ni, PA&#8208;Co), spongy (PA&#8208;Y), and hollow tremella&#8208;like (PA&#8208;Cu) morphologies. Interestingly for PA&#8208;Fe&#8208;1:4 (PA:Fe  3+  = 1:4) a large amount of gas is generated during the gelation process leading to a self&#8208;foaming gel. The PA&#8208;Fe&#8208;1:4 self&#8208;foaming gel shows reversible gel&#8208;sol phase transition. The gel is unusually weankened and transformed into a sol at room temperature, and the sol is reversed to gelation when heated again at 80  o  C. PA&#8208;Fe&#8208;1:4 gel also shows shapeable and load&#8208;bearing properties, and it can bear up to 200 times of its weight, depending on the gas amount fixed in the foam gel and the aging time. This work provides a catalogue of self&#8208;foaming supramolecular gels with tuneable properties based on naturally abundant resources.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new alumino/galloborates RbMT 3  (BO 3  ) 2  O 3  (M = Ba, Sr; T = Al, Ga) were synthesized for the first time using the high&#8208;temperature solution method. All the title compounds have Sr 2  Be 2  B 2  O 7  &#8208;like structures, in which the [BO 3  ] triangles and [TO 4  ] tetrahedra form the final double&#8208;layered configurations the M and Rb site atoms located between and in the double&#8208;layer, respectively. The structure evolution from Sr 2  Be 2  B 2  O 7  to RbMT 3  (BO 3  ) 2  O 3  series was discussed. The broaden energy bandgaps in Al&#8208;based borates when compared with Ga&#8208;based borates can be entirely attributed to the location of Al/Ga s orbitals near the Fermi surface. Further, both experimental and computational approaches were performed to study their structure&#8208;property relationship.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Heteroleptic Dicoordinate Cu(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate Cu(II) complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (  1  ). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X = monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO  3  Et (  2  ), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf  2  )  2  ] (  3  ) and RCuNTf  2  (  4  ) could be isolated. Spectroscopic indications corroborate more Cu(I) than Cu(II) character in all RCuX derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Amides and Amines for the Synergistic Recovery of Rhodium from Hydrochloric Acid by Solvent Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation and isolation of many of the platinum group metals (PGMs) is currently achieved commercially using solvent extraction processes. The extraction of rhodium is problematic however, as a variety of complexes of the form [RhCln(H2O)6&#8208;n ](n&#8208;3)&#8722; are found in hydrochloric acid, making it difficult to design a reagent that can extract all the rhodium. In this work, the synergistic combination of a primary amine (2&#8208;ethylhexylamine, LA) with a primary amide (3,5,5&#8208;trimethylhexanamide, L1) is shown to extract over 85 % of rhodium from 4 M hydrochloric acid.&#160; Two rhodium complexes are shown to reside in the organic phase, the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]; in the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated to the rhodium centre through the nitrogen atom. This insight highlights the need for ligands that target specific metal complexes in the aqueous phase and provides an efficient synergistic solution for the solvent extraction of rhodium.</dc:description>

         <title>Coexistence of Two Different Distorted Octahedral [MnF6]3&#8722;&#160;Sites&#160;in K3[MnF6]: Manifestation in Spectroscopy and Magnetism</title>

         <dc:description>As a consequence of the static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect of the&#160;  5  E ground state of Mn(III) in cubic structures with octahedral parent geometries, their octahedral coordination spheres become distorted.

Here, we report the synthesis of the compound K  3  [MnF  6  ]&#160;  via  &#160;a high&#8208;temperature approach and its crystallization by a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature route.&#160; The main structural motifs are two quasi&#8208;isolated, octahedron&#8208;like [MnF  6  ]  3&#8722;  &#160;anions of quite different nature compared to one met in ideal octahedral Mn(III) Jahn&#8208;Teller systems.&#160; Owing to the internal electric field of&#160;  C  i&#160;  &#160;  symmetry dominated by the next&#8208;neighbour K  +  &#160;ions acting on the Mn  III  &#160;sites, both sites, the pseudo&#8208;rhombic (site 1) and the pseudo&#8208;tetragonally elongated (site 2) MnF  6  3&#8208;  &#160;anions &#160;are present in K  3  [MnF  6  ]. &#160; The characterization of the compound was carried out via single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetometry as well as by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and ligand field spectroscopy.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Virtually inert sulfur hexafluoride becomes a precious pentafluorosulfanylation agent, if properly activated by photoredox catalysis, to access &#945;&#8208;fluoro and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy SF  5  &#8208;compounds.

         <title>Enantioselective CO2 Fixation Via a Heck&#8208;Coupling/Carboxylation Cascade Catalyzed by Nickel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel asymmetric nickel&#8208;based procedure has been developed in which CO2 fixation is achieved as a second step of a truncated Heck coupling. For this, a new chiral ligand has been prepared and shown to achieve enantiomeric excesses up to 99%. The overall process efficiently furnishes chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids, an important class of bioactive products, from easy to prepare starting materials. A combined experimental and computational effort revealed the key steps of the catalytic cycle and suggested the unexpected participation of Ni(I) species in the coupling event</dc:description>

         <title>Racemic Tartrate/Malate Anions Combine with Racemic Complex Cations to Form Optically Active Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur&#8217;s work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, we report a unique example of this phenomenon involving ionic crystals generated from racemic  RR/SS&#8208;tartrate or  R/S&#8208;malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ag3Rh2(2&#8208;aminoethanethiolato)6]3+  (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+) in water. We found that  RR&#8208; and  SS&#8208;tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916;&#160;isomers of [1]3+  to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(RR&#8208;tartrate)3  and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(SS&#8208;tartrate)3  , respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution. While spontaneous resolution also occurs when using  R/S&#8208;malate,  R&#8208; and  S&#8208;malate select the opposite isomers of [1]3+  to give ionic crystals of (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;malate)3  and (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;malate)3  , respectively. In the presence of  S&#8208;  aspartate, (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;tartrate)3  and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;tartrate)3  are preferentially crystallized from &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+  and  RR/SS&#8208;tartrate at solution pH values of 6 and 10, respectively. This finding provides significant insight into the optical resolution of chemical species by spontaneous resolution and the origin of homochirality in nature.</dc:description>

Multifunctional masks for COVID: Multifunctional materials with unique chemical and physical properties can be fabricated by combining electrospun nanofibers, plasmonic nanoparticles, inorganic nanoclusters, and 3D printed structures. This concept article highlights smart nanomaterials&#8217; key role in developing the next generation of face masks with the highest impact in terms of self&#8208;sanitizing, filtration efficiency, and effective comfort.







Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreak. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and antipathogen properties. Here, how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials is outlined. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility of developing a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically driven and on&#8208;demand antipathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photothermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.

         <title>Controlling Emissive Properties by Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds: Alkyl and Aryl meso&#8208;Substituted Porphycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 20, Page 6324-6333, April 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonds are key: The fluorescence intensity of meso&#8208;substituted porphycenes drops sharply when the distance between the hydrogen&#8208;bonded nitrogen atoms decreases below a certain value and the intramolecular hydrogen bonds get stronger. This is attributed to the delocalization of the inner protons, which opens an efficient radiationless deactivation channel.







Abstract
Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, four&#8208;fold meso substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents, this effect is small. To explain this difference, we have synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as the 9,20&#8208;diphenyl and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl derivatives. Analysis of the structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of the six porphycenes, combined with quantum chemical calculations, shows a clear correlation between the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and the efficiency of the radiationless depopulation of the lowest&#8208;excited singlet state. This result led us to propose a model in which the delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. The finding of a correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.

         <title>Small Molecule Activation with Intramolecular &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 20, Page 6263-6273, April 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs have been prepared and their ability to activate small molecules investigated.







Abstract
The intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1&#8208;BR2&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me2N)2C=N]&#8208;C6H4 (3&#8211;6) [BR2=BMes2 (3), BC12H8, (4), BBN (5), BBNO (6)] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis. These novel types of pre&#8208;organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an ortho&#8208;phenylene linker, are capable of activating H&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, O&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, B&#8722;H and C=O bonds. 4 and 5 deprotonated terminal alkynes and acetylene to form the zwitterionic borates 1&#8208;(RC&#8801;C&#8208;BR2)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me2N)2C=NH]&#8208;C6H4 (R=Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH2 and pyrrolidine, to generate the FLP adducts 1&#8208;(R2HN&#8594;BR2)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me2N)2C=NH]&#8208;C6H4, where the N&#8208;H functionality is activated by intramolecular H&#8208;bond interactions. In addition, 5 was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H2CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise, 5 is capable of cleaving H2, HBPin and PhSiH3 to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Novel intramolecular&lt;/b&gt; &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs have been prepared and their ability to activate small molecules investigated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intramolecular &#8220;inverse&#8221; frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) of general formula 1&#8208;BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=N]&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) [BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=BMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), BC&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), BBN (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), BBNO (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;)] were synthesized and structurally characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis. These novel types of pre&#8208;organized FLPs, featuring strongly basic guanidino units rigidly linked to weakly Lewis acidic boryl moieties via an &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylene linker, are capable of activating H&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, O&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, B&#8722;H and C=O bonds. &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; deprotonated terminal alkynes and acetylene to form the zwitterionic borates 1&#8208;(RC&#8801;C&#8208;BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NH]&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (R=Ph, H) and reacted with ammonia, BnNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pyrrolidine, to generate the FLP adducts 1&#8208;(R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HN&#8594;BR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;2&#8208;[(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NH]&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the N&#8208;H functionality is activated by intramolecular H&#8208;bond interactions. In addition, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; was found to rapidly add across the double bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, PhCHO and PhNCO to form cyclic zwitterionic guanidinium borates in excellent yields. Likewise, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; is capable of cleaving H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HBPin and PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to form various amino boranes. Collectively, the results demonstrate that these new types of intramolecular FLPs featuring weakly Lewis acidic boryl and strongly basic guanidino moieties are as potent as conventional intramolecular FLPs with strongly Lewis acidic units in activating small molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cationic Bismuth Aminotroponiminates: Charge Controls Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 20, Page 6230-6239, April 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Central control: A series of bismuth aminotroponiminate cations are discussed and differences between neutral and cationic compounds in terms of coordination chemistry, Lewis acidity, and redox behavior are pinpointed. Specifically, cationization allows switching from ligand&#8208;centered redox events to metal&#8208;centered redox events, facilitating rare examples of quasi&#8208;reversible electron transfer at bismuth.







Abstract
The behavior of the redox&#8208;active aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand in the coordination sphere of bismuth has been investigated in neutral and cationic compounds, [Bi(ATI)3] and [Bi(ATI)2Ln][A] (L=neutral ligand; n=0, 1; A=counteranion). Their coordination chemistry in solution and in the solid state has been analyzed through (variable&#8208;temperature) NMR spectroscopy, line&#8208;shape analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and their Lewis acidity has been evaluated by using the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett method (and modifications thereof). Cyclic voltammetry, in combination with DFT calculations, indicates that switching between ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered redox events is possible by altering the charge of the compounds from 0 in neutral species to +1 in cationic compounds. This adds important facets to the rich redox chemistry of ATIs and to the redox chemistry of bismuth compounds, which is, so far, largely unexplored.

         <title>Highly Emissive 9&#8208;Borafluorene Derivatives: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Device Fabrication</title>

Luminescent boroles: Highly twisted donor&#8208;functionalised 9&#8208;borafluorenes have been synthesised that exhibit bright luminescence without obvious charge&#8208;transfer character, as well as excellent thermal stability, suggesting their suitability for optoelectronic applications (see figure). Two organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices fabricated with these compounds showed properties highly favourable for future development.







Abstract
A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, have been prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relatively high quantum yields (up to 73.6&#8201;% for FMesB&#8208;Cz as a neat film). The results suggest that the highly twisted donor groups suppress charge transfer, but the intrinsic photophysical properties of the 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain. The new compounds showed enhanced stability towards the atmosphere, and exhibited excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for application in materials science. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibited strong yellow&#8208;greenish electroluminescence, with a maximum luminance intensity of &gt;22&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These are the first two examples of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and they have enabled us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties while improving their stability.

         <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>

New phototheranostics! Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species and act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment (see figure). They exhibit all the properties of an ideal photosensitizer, required for simultaneous fluorescence imaging and photodynamic activity, and as such they have potential for phototheranostics.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however, there is continuing search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorb and emit in the 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm region, present low cytotoxicity in the dark, are efficiently uptaken by cells, are fluorescent in intracellular medium, and generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation, killing cancer cells within 2&#8197;h at low concentration (2.0&#8197;&#956;m). The imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are a potential new tool for phototheranostics, because they can be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Photohomolysis and Photoheterolysis in Aryl Sulfonates and Aryl Phosphates</title>

         <dc:description>
The photochemical behaviour of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) in polar and nonpolar media has been investigated by laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments. Two main pathways have been identified, namely the photohomolysis of the ArO&#8722;X bond or the photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8722;OX bond depending on the nature of the leaving group (OX) and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring.







Abstract
The photochemical behaviour of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) in polar and nonpolar media has been investigated by laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments. Two main pathways have been identified, namely the photohomolysis of the ArO&#8722;X bond or the photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8722;OX bond depending on the nature of the leaving group (OX) and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring. In nonpolar solvents the esters are quite photostable due to an efficient triplet deactivation. In polar solvents, the homolytic fragmentation of the ArO&#8722;S bond from the exited singlets was found in aryl sulfonates bearing moderately electron&#8208;donating groups as well as electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. In electron&#8208;rich aryl phosphates and sulfonates photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8722;OP/Ar&#8722;OS bond took place as the exclusive pathway.

&lt;p&gt;The photochemical behaviour of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) in polar and nonpolar media has been investigated by laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments. Two main pathways have been identified, namely the photohomolysis of the ArO&#8722;X bond or the photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8722;OX bond depending on the nature of the leaving group (OX) and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring. In nonpolar solvents the esters are quite photostable due to an efficient triplet deactivation. In polar solvents, the homolytic fragmentation of the ArO&#8722;S bond from the exited singlets was found in aryl sulfonates bearing moderately electron&#8208;donating groups as well as electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. In electron&#8208;rich aryl phosphates and sulfonates photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8722;OP/Ar&#8722;OS bond took place as the exclusive pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

The conjugated 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene bridge of our terphenylic macrocycle is significantly longer than the backbone it rotates around, thereby forcing itself to bend along the central pylon. The synthesis of the macromolecule is largely based on orthogonal acetylene scaffolding strategies, allowing to sequentially finalize both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the final, bicyclic compound are analyzed and discussed.







Abstract
The novel diacetylene bridged terphenylic macrocycle 1 is presented and discussed in the context of rotationally restricted &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; oligomers. The 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene bridge of diacetylene 1 is significantly longer than its terphenyl backbone, forcing the bridge to bend around the central pylon. The synthesis of molecule 1 is based to a large extent on acetylene scaffolding strategies, profiting from orthogonal alkyne protection groups to close both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling sequentially. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the bicyclic target structure 1 are analyzed. In&#8208;depth NMR investigations not only reveal an unexpected spatial arrangement with both oligomer strands bent alongside the backbone, but also display the limited stability of the model compound in the presence of molecular oxygen.

         <title>Carbon Origami via an Alumina&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Strategy</title>

Rational folding of nanographenes has the potential to penetrate the barrier between macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;worlds for the engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials with functional molecular shapes. This work reports that an alumina&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation strategy is able to tackle this challenge allowing both the effective incorporation of non&#8208;hexagonal rings and the formation of helical structures leading to the folding of nanographenes akin to origami.







Abstract
The synthesis of pristine non&#8208;planar nanographenes (NGs) via a cyclodehydrofluorination strategy is reported and the creation of highly strained systems via alumina&#8208;assisted C&#8722;F bond activation is shown. Steric hindrance could execute an alternative coupling program leading to rare octagon formation offering access to elusive non&#8208;classical NGs. The combination of two alternative ways of folding could lead to the formation of various 3D NG objects, resembling the Japanese art of origami. The power of the presented &#8220;origami&#8221; approach is proved by the assembly of 12 challenging nanographenes that are &#960;&#8208;isoelectronic to planar hexabenzocoronene but forced out of planarity.

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to Tetracyclic Eight&#8208;Membered Lactams through a Dearomative Heck Reaction and an Alkylative Ring&#8208;Opening Driven by Photoexcited Spiroindolines</title>

Get (photo)excited! A light&#8208;driven alkylative ring&#8208;opening of spiroindolines with complete diastereoselectivity is developed to construct indolo&#8208; and benzoannulated eight&#8208;membered lactams, in which the spiroindoline performs as both reagent and photocatalyst.







Abstract
An external&#8208;photocatalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven alkylative ring&#8208;opening of stable spiroindolines was developed to construct indolo&#8208; and benzoannulated eight&#8208;membered lactams. The spiroindolines were prepared from tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines by a dearomative Heck reaction. Mechanistic experimental studies on the alkylative ring opening suggested that a photoredox pathway was involved, in which the spiroindoline performed as both reagent and photosensitizer. DFT calculations showed that the radical addition toward a cyclic alkene was the key to the diastereoselective formation of tetracyclic medium&#8208;sized lactams.

Skinny curves: Well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are prepared using an ammonia&#8208;based hydrothermal synthesis and a commercial solid&#8208;type black carbon as raw material. The oxygen reduction reaction activity and durability of NHCs depend on the shell thickness. The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8722;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbons have been regarded as one of the promising materials alternatives to precious&#8208;metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their high activity and stability. In this paper, well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are firstly synthesized by using an ammonia&#8208;based hydrothermal synthesis that is environmentally friendly and suitable for mass production in industry and a commercial black carbon as raw material. Moreover, the shell thickness of the NHCs can be easily tuned by this hydrothermal strategy. Zn&#8211;air battery test results reveal shell thickness&#8208;dependent activity and durability for ORR over the NHCs, which exceeds that obtained by commercial Pt/C (20&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8211;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface, which served as the main active sites for ORR as evidenced by DFT calculations. The proposed approach may open a way for designing curved hollow carbons with high graphitization degree and dopant nitrogen level for metal&#8211;air batteries or fuel cells.

Efficient electrocatalytic conversion of dichloromethane to hydrocarbons using a metal&#8208;free triazole&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst.







Abstract
In this work, the electrocatalytic reduction of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) into hydrocarbons involving a main group element&#8208;based molecular triazole&#8208;porphyrin electrocatalyst H2PorT8 is reported. This catalyst converted CH2Cl2 in acetonitrile to various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethylene) with a Faradaic efficiency of 70&#8201;% and current density of &#8722;13&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a potential of &#8722;2.2&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ using water as a proton source. The findings of this study and its mechanistic interpretations demonstrated that H2PorT8 was an efficient and stable catalyst for the hydrodechlorination of CH2Cl2 and that main group catalysts could be potentially used for exploring new catalytic reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Activity of Ferrocenyl and Ruthenocenyl Analogues of Etoposide: Discovery of a Novel Dual Inhibitor of Topoisomerase II Activity and Tubulin Polymerization</title>

Metal makes a difference: Ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide have been synthesized to evaluate the impact of the metallocenyl moiety on their mode of actions. Replacement of the carbohydrate moiety with the &#969;&#8208;ferrocenylalkylamino group led to significantly improved cytotoxicity toward cancer cell lines, including etoposide&#8208;resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines, and resulted in dual inhibitory activity toward TOPO II and tubulin polymerization.







Abstract
Two series of the ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide bearing 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl or aminoalkyl linker were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic properties, influence on the cell cycle, ability to induce tubulin polymerization, and inhibition of topoisomerase II activity. We found that the replacement of the etoposide carbohydrate moiety with a metallocenyl group led to organometallic conjugates exhibiting differentiated antiproliferative activity. Biological studies demonstrated that two ferrocenylalkylamino conjugates were notably more active than etoposide, with submicromolar or low&#8208;micromolar IC50 values towards SW620, etoposide&#8208;resistant SW620E, and methotrexate&#8208;resistant SW620M cancer cell lines. Moreover, the simplest ferrocenylmethylamino conjugate exerted dual inhibitory action against tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase II activity while other studied compounds affected only topoisomerase II activity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Point Mutant Inverts the Stereoselectivity of a Carbonyl Reductase toward &#946;&#8208;Ketoesters with Enhanced Activity</title>

Switching selectivity: To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of antiPrelog carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, rational enzyme design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to antiPrelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1&#8211;99.1&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of antiPrelog carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, rational enzyme design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to antiPrelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1&#8211;99.1&#8201;% ee). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8211;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the antiPrelog&#8208;preferred conformation. In contrast, the relatively large and rigid structure of the aromatic ketones prevents them from forming the antiPrelog&#8208;preferred conformation.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Coordinated Framework Film&#8208;based Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors with AC Line Filtering Performance</title>

AC/RC: A new coordination polymer framework film is prepared by liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial method based on an anisotropic catechol ligand. As&#8208;fabricated in&#8208;plane micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) exhibit high volumetric specific capacitance of 121&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3, typical alternating current (AC) line filtering performance, and short resistance capacitance (RC) time constant of 0.08&#8197;ms. This work provides a new material and processing method towards MSCs with AC line filtering performance.







Abstract
Coordination polymer frameworks (CPFs) have broad applications due to their excellent features, including stable structure, intrinsic porosity, and others. However, preparation of thin&#8208;film CPFs for energy storage and conversion remains a challenge because of poor compatibility between conductive substrates and CPFs and crucial conditions for thin&#8208;film preparation. In this work, a CPF film was prepared by the coordination of the anisotropic four&#8208;armed ligand and CuII at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. Such film&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) are fabricated through high&#8208;energy scribing and electrolytes soaking. As&#8208;fabricated MSCs displayed high volumetric specific capacitance of 121.45&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Besides, the volumetric energy density of MSCs reached 52.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3, which exceeds the electrochemical performance of most reported CPF&#8208;based MSCs. Especially, the device exhibited alternating current (AC) line filtering performance (&#8722;84.2&#176; at 120&#8197;Hz) and a short resistance capacitance (RC) constant of 0.08&#8197;ms. This work not only provides a new CPF for MSCs with AC line filtering performance but also paves the way for thin&#8208;film CPFs preparation with versatile applications.

Zirconium activates the benzylic position again. A C&#8722;C bond is formed between the &#945;&#8208;carbon of an &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylated amine and an alkene. Exclusive formation of the linear products is observed in the presence of the bulky vinylsilanes. The method is also directed toward the formation of heterocycles, offering an alternative disconnection for their syntheses.







Abstract
The zirconium catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes with N&#8208;aryl&#8208; and sterically demanding N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;arylated secondary amines by using commercially available Zr(NMe2)4 is reported. N&#8208;phenyl&#8208; and N&#8208;isopropylbenzylamine are used as amine substrates to establish the alkene substrate scope. Exclusively linear products are obtained in the presence of bulky vinylsilanes. Challenging &#945;&#8208;heteroarylated amines and functionalized alkene substrates are compatible with this easy to use catalyst, affording a new disconnection strategy for the atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic preparation of selectively substituted saturated &#945;&#8208;arylated heterocycles.

A dinuclear monosulfido bridged diiron(II) complex is reported that can be oxidized stepwise to diiron(II/III) and diiron(III/III) complexes while retaining the [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] core. This unprecedented series of low&#8208;coordinate complexes has been thoroughly characterized using inter alia, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry.







Abstract
A [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] subunit with a single sulfide bridging two low&#8208;coordinate iron ions is the supposed active site of the iron&#8208;molybdenum co&#8208;factor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase. Here we report a dinuclear monosulfido bridged diiron(II) complex with a similar complex geometry that can be oxidized stepwise to diiron(II/III) and diiron(III/III) complexes while retaining the [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] core. The series of complexes has been characterized crystallographically, and electronic structures have been studied using, inter alia, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Further, cleavage of the [Fe&#8208;S&#8208;Fe] unit by CS2 is presented.

         <title>De Novo Design of Selective Quadruplex&#8211;Duplex Junction Ligands and Structural Characterisation of Their Binding Mode: Targeting the G4 Hot&#8208;Spot</title>

Finding the G4 spot: The unusual electrostatic potential of G&#8208;tetrads at the interface with a duplex in quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions inspires the design of cationic aromatic frameworks for the selective targeting of these hybrid DNA architectures, thus providing a stepping stone to quadruplex discrimination.







Abstract
Targeting the interface between DNA quadruplex and duplex regions by small molecules holds significant promise in both therapeutics and nanotechnology. Herein, a new pharmacophore is reported, which selectively binds with high affinity to quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions, while presenting a poorer affinity for G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA alone. Ligands complying with the reported pharmacophore exhibit a significant affinity and selectivity for quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions, including the one observed in the HIV&#8208;1 LTR&#8208;III sequence. The structure of the complex between a quadruplex&#8211;duplex junction with a ligand of this family has been determined by NMR methods. According to these data, the remarkable selectivity of this structural motif for quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions is achieved through an unprecedented interaction mode so far unexploited in medicinal and biological chemistry: the insertion of a benzylic ammonium moiety into the centre of the partially exposed G&#8208;tetrad at the interface with the duplex. Further decoration of the described scaffolds with additional fragments opens up the road to the development of selective ligands for G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming regions of the genome.

Redox chemistry with bismuth: Snapshots of the redox chemistry of heavy p&#8208;block elements are difficult to obtain and remain rare to date. This work demonstrates that redox&#8208;active ligands in the coordination sphere of bismuth facilitate well&#8208;behaved one&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactions according to cyclic voltammetry. The charge of the complexes (neutral vs. cationic) allows the spin density to shift either towards the ligand or towards the metal center. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Lichtenberg et&#8197;al. on page 6230.

Fluorescent tetracyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyri(mi)dines can be generated by microwave&#8208;assisted high order (8+2) thermal cycloadditions between in situ formed benzynes and the corresponding bicyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyr(im)idines. These cycloadducts absorb and emit photons in the 400&#8208;500 nm region and are efficiently uptaken by cells with low cytotoxicity. Upon irradiation, these molecules generate singlet oxygen and are able to kill cancer cells at low concentration, thus emerging as promising candidates for photodynamic therapy and fluorescence imaging. .

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluorescent tetracyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyri(mi)dines&lt;/b&gt; can be generated by microwave&#8208;assisted high order (8+2) thermal cycloadditions between in situ formed benzynes and the corresponding bicyclic imidazo[1,2&#8208;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyr(im)idines. These cycloadducts absorb and emit photons in the 400&#8208;500 nm region and are efficiently uptaken by cells with low cytotoxicity. Upon irradiation, these molecules generate singlet oxygen and are able to kill cancer cells at low concentration, thus emerging as promising candidates for photodynamic therapy and fluorescence imaging. .

The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has pointed out the urgent need to employ advanced and smart materials to realize innovative medical protective equipment. To this end, the next&#8208;generation face masks are conceived to be personalized, smart, and reusable. This great achievement can be accomplished thanks to light&#8208;responsive and fibrous nanomaterials' unique chemical and physical properties. This synergistic approach allows the realization of a new generation of face masks effective against pathogens upon light activation. For further information see the Concept article by F. Pierini et&#8197;al. on page 6112.

         <dc:description>
A bobcat ponders which path he should take up the mountain: a long hiking trail or a more direct, but steep, climbing route. His decision is influenced by the gear that he carries. In this case, the bobcat is equipped with rope and is therefore likely to choose the climbing route. Similarly, cross&#8208;coupling catalysts sometimes have a &#8220;choice&#8221; between two different electrophiles, and a catalyst&#8242;s selectivity for one electrophile over the other is often influenced by the ligands that it bears. For more information see the Minireview by Sharon&#8197;R. Neufeldt and co&#8208;workers on page 6161.

Rational folding of nanographenes has the potential to penetrate the barrier between macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;worlds for the engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials with functional molecular shapes. This work reports that an alumina&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation strategy is able to tackle this challenge allowing both the effective incorporation of non&#8208;hexagonal rings and the formation of helical structures leading to the folding of nanographenes akin to origami. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Amsharov et&#8197;al. on page 6223.

The structural motif defined by a G&#8208;quadruplex DNA juxtaposed to duplex regions has been identified as a hot&#8208;spot for molecular recognition, and selectively targeted by a family of benzylamine&#8208;containing derivatives. The understanding of this new mode of interaction was uncovered by the structural dissection of both ligand and receptor contributions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;G. Santana, C. Gonz&#225;lez, J.&#8197;L. Asensio, et&#8197;al. on page 6204.

Abstract
Organothiocyanate and organoselenocyanate compounds are of paramount importance in organic chemistry as they are key intermediates to access sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Therefore, among the different synthetic pathways to get SCN&#8208; and SeCN&#8208;containing molecules, original methodologies using electrophilic reagents have recently been explored. This Minireview will showcase the recent advances that have been made. In particular, the design of several electrophilic sources and their applications for the thiocyanation and the selenocyanation of various classes of compounds will be highlighted and discussed.

         <title>Chemodivergence between Electrophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 20, Page 6161-6177, April 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cross&#8208;coupling reactions, chemoselectivity becomes a concern when two or more (pseudo)halides are present in the substrates. This minireview surveys cases in which divergent chemoselectivity between electrophiles can be achieved under different reaction conditions. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing the possible mechanistic origins of selectivity control.







Abstract
Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.

         <title>Separation of Xylene Isomers in the Anion&#8208;Pillared Square Grid Material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 20, Page 6187-6190, April 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given its unique anion&#8208;pillared grid structure and suitable pore size, SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu exhibits a preference to adsorb o&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene over p&#8208;xylene in liquid phase. The C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction is the key to the different adsorption performance of xylene isomers on the SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu adsorbent.







Abstract
Xylene isomer separation is considered one of the seven separation challenges that changed the world. In addition, the high&#8208;energy demand of xylene separation highlights the need for efficient novel adsorbents. Herein, the liquid&#8208;phase separation potential of the anion&#8208;pillared hybrid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu was studied for preferential adsorption of o&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene over p&#8208;xylene, which was inspired by a previous complexation crystallization method for separating m&#8208;xylene. We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for o&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for m&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction, and the host&#8211;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &gt; m&#8208;xylene &gt; p&#8208;xylene.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Given its unique&lt;/b&gt; anion&#8208;pillared grid structure and suitable pore size, SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu exhibits a preference to adsorb &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene over &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene in liquid phase. The C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction is the key to the different adsorption performance of xylene isomers on the SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu adsorbent.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xylene isomer separation is considered one of the seven separation challenges that changed the world. In addition, the high&#8208;energy demand of xylene separation highlights the need for efficient novel adsorbents. Herein, the liquid&#8208;phase separation potential of the anion&#8208;pillared hybrid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu was studied for preferential adsorption of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene over &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene, which was inspired by a previous complexation crystallization method for separating &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene. We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene versus &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene versus &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction, and the host&#8211;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene &amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene &amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;xylene.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive &#945;&#8208;Desulfonylation</title>

Catalyst&#8208;controlled cleavage: A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized nitriles and ketones from readily&#8208;available &#945;&#8208;sulfonylated precursors. The homolytic reductive C&#8722;S cleavage occurs under the control of an in situ generated titanium(III) catalyst and it can be combined with a Michael addition reaction to achieve a one&#8208;pot desulfonylative alkylation.







Abstract
A titanium(III)&#8208;catalyzed desulfonylation gives access to functionalized alkyl nitrile building blocks from &#945;&#8208;sulfonyl nitriles, circumventing traditional base&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;alkylation conditions and strong single electron donors. The reaction tolerates numerous functional groups including free alcohols, esters, amides, and it can be applied also to the &#945;&#8208;desulfonylation of ketones. In addition, a one&#8208;pot desulfonylative alkylation is demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a catalyst&#8208;dependent mechanism involving a homolytic C&#8722;S cleavage.

         <title>Do Docking Sites Persist Upon Fluorination? The Diadamantyl Ether&#8208;Aromatics Challenge for Rotational Spectroscopy and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 20, Page 6198-6203, April 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of H&#8594;F substitution on the interactions and structure of complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene and a series of fluorinated benzenes have been studied using rotational spectroscopy. London dispersion is the governing factor in directing spatial arrangement. The preferred binding position changes upon partial or full substitution, whereas the overall contributions of the intermolecular interactions involved are similar.







Abstract
Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proven to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether (C20H30O) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. In this work, an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes is reported to analyze the effect of H&#8594;F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.

         <title>A Luminescent Two&#8208;Coordinate AuI Bimetallic Complex with a Tandem&#8208;Carbene Structure: A Molecular Design for the Enhancement of TADF Radiative Decay Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 20, Page 6191-6197, April 7, 2021. </description>

Working in tandem: A luminescent bimetallic AuI complex has been synthesized and studied. Both carbene ligands in the bimetallic complex act as electron acceptors in tandem to blue shift emission and shorten the radiative lifetime.







Abstract
A luminescent bimetallic AuI complex comprised of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and carbazole (Cz) ligands, that is, (NHC&#8217;)Au(NHC)AuCz has been synthesized and studied. Both carbene ligands in the bimetallic complex act as electron acceptors in tandem to increase the energy separation between the ground and excited state, which is higher than those found in either monometallic analogue, (NHC)AuCz and (NHC&#8217;)AuCz. A coplanar geometry designed into the tandem complex ensures sufficient electronic coupling between the &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the ligands to impart a strong oscillator strength to the singlet intra&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (1ICT) transition. Theoretical modelling indicates that the emissive ICT excited state involves both NHC ligands. The tandem complex gives blue luminescence (&#955;max=480&#8197;nm) with a high photoluminescent quantum yield (&#934;PL=0.80) with a short decay lifetime (&#964;=0.52&#8197;&#956;s). Temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical studies indicate that emission is via thermally assisted delayed fluorescence (TADF) and give a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST=50&#8197;meV, 400&#8197;cm&#8722;1) consistent with the short TADF lifetime.

         <title>Structural insights into the molecular recognition mechanism of the cancer and pathogenic epitope, LacdiNAc by immune&#8208;related lectins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions of glycan&#8208;specific epitopes to human lectin receptors represent novel immune checkpoints for investigating cancer and infection diseases. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that combines isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, we disclosed the molecular determinants that govern the recognition of the tumour and pathogenic glycobiomarker LacdiNAc (GalNAc&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LDN), including their comparison with the ubiquitous LacNAc epitope (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LN), by two human immune&#8208;related lectins, galectin&#8208;3 (hGal&#8208;3) and the macrophage galactose C&#8208;type lectin (hMGL). A different mechanism of binding and interactions is observed for the hGal&#8208;3/LDN and hMGL/LDN complexes, which explains the remarkable difference in the binding specificity of LDN and LN by these two lectins. The new structural clues reported herein are fundamental for the chemical design of mimetics targeting hGal&#8208;3/hMGL recognition process.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl esters as exchangeable stoppers for the&#160;construction of photoactive [2]rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2]rotaxane building blocks with pentafluorophenyl ester stoppers have been efficiently prepared on a multi&#8208;gram scale. Reaction of these building blocks with various nucleophiles gave access to a wide range of [2]rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers in good to excellent yields. The rotaxane structure is fully preserved during these chemical transformations. Actually, the addition&#8208;elimination mechanism at work during these transformations totally prevents the unthreading of the axle moiety of the mechanically interlocked system. The stopper exchange reactions were optimized both in solution and under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. While amide formation is more efficient in solution, the solvent&#8208;free conditions are more powerful for the transesterification reactions. Starting from a fullerene&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene derivative, this new strategy gave easy access to a photoactive [2]rotaxane incorporating a C  60  &#160;moiety and two Bodipy stoppers. Despite the absence of covalent connectivity between the Bodipy and the fullerene moieties in this photoactive molecular device, efficient through space excited state interactions have been evidenced in this rotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Synthesis of Arylsulfonyl Fluorides: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first metal&#8208;free procedure for the synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides is reported. Under organophotoredox conditions, aryl diazonium salts reacts with readily available SO 2 source (DABSO) to afford the desired product via simple nucleophilic fluorination. The reaction scope tolerates the presence of both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aryls and demonstrated a broad functional group tolerance. To shed the light on the reaction mechanism, several experimental techniques have been combined including fluorescence, NMR, EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium Complex of N&#8208;Fused Bilatrienone: Oxidative Cleavage of N&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Induced by Iridium&#8211;Cyclooctadiene Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;fused porphyrin (NFP) is a unique class of photostable near&#8208;infrared dyes with an 18&#960; aromatic tetrapyrrole macrocyclic skeleton containing a tri&#8208;fused pentacyclic moiety. Here we report the synthesis of an iridium complex of N&#8208;fused bilatrienone as the degradation product of Ir&#8211;cyclooctadiene (cod)&#8208;induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring&#8208;opened complex featured a broken &#960;&#8208;conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod&#8208;isomerized ( &#954; 1 , &#951; 3 &#8208;C 8 H 12 )&#8211;Ir complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are obtained by a one&#8208;pot approach in the presence of a template reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only subclass to form with sterical hindrance. The structural analyses carried out on compounds  1  and  14  revealed distinct conformational differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH  &#8230;  Cl hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen bridge strongly favours one of the two possible atropisomers. Hindered rotation of the  meso  &#8208;aryl groups is observed only in the cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives  10  and  15  and leads to the observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923 nm are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e  &#8208;  and 2e  &#8208;  reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc phlorinate.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrosilylation of Ketenes with Silicon Electrophiles: Access to Fully Substituted Aldehyde&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Little&#8208;explored hydrosilylation of ketenes promoted by main&#8208;group catalysts is reported. The boron Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane accelerates the slow uncatalyzed reaction of ketenes and hydrosilanes, thereby providing a convenient access to the new class of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted aldehyde&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers. Yields are moderate to high, and  Z  configuration is preferred. The corresponding silyl bis&#8208;enol ethers are also available when using dihydrosilanes. The related trityl&#8208;cation&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation involving self&#8208;regeneration of silylium ions is far less effective.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Ligand and its Corresponding Copper Complex for the Development of Electrochemical Affinity Biosensors.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bistriazole ligand and its corresponding copper complexes were synthesized and characterized for the first time and proposed as new labels for the development of electrochemical aptasensors. The bistriazole ligand was prepared from methyl 1,6&#8208;heptadiyne&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(azidomethyl)phenol using classical CuAAC in presence of different copper salts. X&#8208;Ray structure of bistriazole showed a symmetry center (C1). UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;band EPR spectra showed that coordination capacity of bistriazole ligand was improved in presence of triethylamine due to deprotonation of triazole and phenolate moieties. After complexation with copper, the obtained complex was successfully attached to an anti&#8208;estradiol aptamer through thiol&#8208;maleimide coupling, and the resulting labelled aptamer was immobilized on a carbon screen&#8208;printed electrode by carbodiimide coupling. The electrochemical response of the resulting sensor was shown to decrease in the presence of estradiol, demonstrating that the developed complexes can be applied for the development of aptasensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;trifluoromethyl complexes and their role in generating spectroscopic evidence for a gold(I)&#8208;difluorocarbene species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Readily&#8208;prepared and bench&#8208;stable [Au(CF  3  )(NHC)] compounds were synthesized using new methodologies, starting from [Au(OH)(NHC)], [Au(Cl)(NHC)] or [Au(L)(NHC)]HF  2  precursors (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). The mechanism of formation of these species was investigated. Consequently, a new and straightforward strategy for the mild and selective cleavage of a single carbon&#8208;fluorine bond from [Au(CF  3  )(NHC)] complexes was attempted and found to be reversible in the presence of an additional nucleophilic fluoride source. This straightforward technique has led to the unprecedented spectroscopic observation of a gold(I)&#8208;NHC difluorocarbene species.</dc:description>

         <title>Paramagnetic Solid&#8208;state NMR to Localize the Metal&#8208;Ion Cofactor in an Oligomeric DnaB Helicase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paramagnetic metal ions can be inserted into ATP&#8208;fueled motor proteins by exchanging the diamagnetic Mg  2+  cofactor with Mn  2+  or Co  2+  . Then, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) or pseudo&#8208;contact shifts (PCSs) can be measured to report on the localization of the metal ion within the protein. We determine the metal position in the oligomeric bacterial DnaB helicase from  Helicobacter pylori  complexed with the transition&#8208;state ATP&#8208;analogue ADP:AlF  4  &#8208;  and single&#8208;stranded DNA using solid&#8208;state NMR and a structure&#8208;calculation protocol employing CYANA. We discuss and compare the use of Mn  2+  and Co  2+  in localizing the ATP cofactor in large oligomeric protein assemblies.  31  P PCSs induced in the Co  2+  &#8208;containing sample are then used to localize the DNA phosphate groups on the Co  2+  PCS tensor surface enabling structural insights into DNA binding to the DnaB helicase.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomers Intermediates in Between Two Novel Distinct Homonuclear Uranium(IV) DOTP Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel aqueous U IV  complexes were synthesized by the interaction between the tetravalent uranium cation and the (  1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid)  (DOTP) macrocyclic ligand. Two distinct homonuclear complexes were identified&#8208; the first was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;cage&#8221;, [U(DOTPH  6  )  2  ] complex, in which the U  IV  cation is octa&#8208;coordinated to 4 phosphonic arms from each ligand in a square anti&#8208;prism geometry, with a C  4  symmetry. The second is the &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; [U(DOTPH  4  )] complex where the tetravalent cation is located between the macrocycle O  4  and N  4  planes. With the help of UV&#8208;vis absorption,  1  H/  31  P&#8208;NMR, ATR&#8208;IR and MALDI&#8208;TOFMS analytical techniques, the chemical interchange between both species is presented. It is shown that the one&#8208;way transition is governed by the formation of a multiple number of soluble oligomeric species consisting of a varied stoichiometric ratios of both characterized homonuclear complexes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have synthesized quadruply BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes through four&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulene with peripheral phenyl groups exhibits crystal polymorphism, in which the circulene core adopts both planar and saddle conformations in the solid state. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed the weaker aromaticity of azaborine than benzene renders the flexibility to BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cytotoxic Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene)carbazolide Gold(III) Complex Targets DNA By Partial Intercalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses of bis(triazolium)carbazole precursors and their corresponding coinage metal (Au, Ag) complexes are reported. For alkylated triazolium salts, di&#8208; or tetranuclear complexes with bridging ligands were isolated, while the bis(aryl) analogue afforded a bis(carbene) Au  I  &#8208;CNC pincer complex suitable for oxidation to the redox&#8208;stable [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  cation. Although the ligand salt and the [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  complex were both notably cytotoxic toward the breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, the Au  III  complex was somewhat more selective. Electrophoresis, viscometry, UV&#8208;vis, CD and LD spectros&#173;copy suggest the cytotoxic [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  complex behaves as a partial DNA intercalator.  In silico  screening indicated that the [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  complex can target DNA three&#8208;way junctions with good specificity, several other regular  B  &#8208;DNA forms, and  Z  &#8208;DNA. Multiple hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;type interactions involving T and A bases appear to be important for  B  &#8208;form DNA binding, while phosphate O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions evidently underpin  Z  &#8208;DNA binding.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The syntheses of bis(triazolium)carbazole precursors and their corresponding coinage metal (Au, Ag) complexes are reported. For alkylated triazolium salts, di&#8208; or tetranuclear complexes with bridging ligands were isolated, while the bis(aryl) analogue afforded a bis(carbene) Au  I  &#8208;CNC pincer complex suitable for oxidation to the redox&#8208;stable [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  cation. Although the ligand salt and the [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  complex were both notably cytotoxic toward the breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, the Au  III  complex was somewhat more selective. Electrophoresis, viscometry, UV&#8208;vis, CD and LD spectros&#173;copy suggest the cytotoxic [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  complex behaves as a partial DNA intercalator.  In silico  screening indicated that the [Au  III  (CNC)Cl]  +  complex can target DNA three&#8208;way junctions with good specificity, several other regular  B  &#8208;DNA forms, and  Z  &#8208;DNA. Multiple hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;type interactions involving T and A bases appear to be important for  B  &#8208;form DNA binding, while phosphate O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions evidently underpin  Z  &#8208;DNA binding. The CNC ligand effectively stabilizes the Au  III  ion, preventing reduction in the presence of glutathione. Both the redox stability and DNA affinity of the hit compound might be key factors underpinning its cytotoxicity  in vitro  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activation of a Copper Biscarbene Mechano&#8208;Catalyst Using Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy Supported by Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy allows investigation of the effect of mechanical force on individual bonds. By determining the forces necessary to sufficiently activate bonds to trigger dissociation, it is possible to predict the behavior of mechanophores. Here, we measure the force necessary to activate a copper biscarbene mechano&#8208;catalyst intended for self&#8208;healing materials. By using a safety line bypassing the mechanophore, we were able to pinpoint the dissociation of the investigated bond and determine rupture forces to range from 1.6 to 2.6 nN at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide. The average length&#8208;increase upon rupture of the Cu&#8208;C bond due to the stretching of the safety line agrees with quantum chemical calculations, but the values exhibit an unusual scattering. We assign this scattering to the conformational flexibility of the mechanophore, which includes formation of a threaded structure and recoiling of the safety line.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based &#8220;Turn&#8208;Off&#8221; Probe with Broad Detection Range for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of metals in different environments with high selectivity and specificity is one of the prerequisites of the fight against environmental pollution with these elements. Pyrenes are well suited for the fluorescence sensing in different media. The applied sensing principle typically relies on the formation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular excimers, which is however limiting the sensitivity range due to masking of e.g. quenching effects by the excimer emission. Herein we report a highly selective, structurally rigid chemical sensor based on the monomer fluorescence of pyrene moieties bearing triazole groups. This sensor can quantitatively detect Cu  2+  , Pb  2+  and Hg  2+  in organic solvents over a broad concentrations range, even in the presence of ubiquitous ions such as Na  +  , K  +  , Ca  2+  and Mg  2+  . The strongly emissive sensor&#8217;s fluorescence with a long lifetime of 165 ns is quenched by a 1:1 complex formation upon addition of metal ions in acetonitrile. Upon addition of a tenfold excess of the metal ion to the sensor, agglomerates with a diameter of about 3 nm are formed. Due to complex interactions in the system, conventional linear correlations are not observed for all concentrations. Therefore, a critical comparison between the conventional Job plot interpretation, the method of Benesi&#8208;Hildebrand, and a non&#8208;linear fit is presented. The reported system enables the specific and robust sensing of medically and environmentally relevant ions in the health&#8208;relevant nM range and could be used e.g. for the monitoring of the respective ions in waste streams.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Ligand Polarity on the Internal Dipoles and Ferroelectric Distortion in BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface adsorbates and surrounding matrix species have been demonstrated to affect the properties of nanoscale ferroelectrics and nanoscale ferroelectric composites; potentially counteracting performance losses encountered that can occur in small particle sizes. In this work we investigate the effects of nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF  4  &#8722;  ) ligand capping on the surface of various sizes of BaTiO  3  nanocubes with combined neutron diffraction and neutron pair distribution function (PDF), density functional theory (DFT), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. The low real space PDF region provides an unobstructed view of rhombohedral (split short and long) Ti&#8208;O distances in BaTiO  3  &#160;  nanocubes, mimicking the well&#8208;established order&#8208;disorder local structure found in bulk BaTiO  3  . Interestingly, the intermediate&#8208;range order in nanocubes is found to be orthorhombic, rather than tetragonal. We conclude that polar ligands adsorbed at BaTiO  3  surfaces stabilize the correlation length scale of local rhombohedral distortions in ferroelectric nanoparticles relative to nonpolar ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of Non&#8208;innocence of Phosphaquinodimethane Ligands when Charge and Aromaticity Come into Play</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several phosphaquinodimethanes and their M(CO)5 complexes (M = Cr, Mo, W) and model derivatives have been theoretically investigated regarding the quest of non&#8208;innocence. Computed structural and electronic properties of the P&#8208;Me/NH2 substituted phosphaquinodimethanes and tungsten complexes revealed an interesting non&#8208;innocent ligand behaviour for the radical anion complexes with distonic ion character and a strong rearomatization of the middle phenyl ring. The latter was further probed taking also geometric aromaticity (HOMA) and quinoid distortion parameters, (HOMQc) into account, as well as NICS(1). Furthermore, the effect of the P&#8208;substitution was investigated for real (or plausible) complexes and their free ligands focusing on the resulting aromaticity at the middle phenyl ring and vertical one&#8208;electron redox processes. The best picture of ligand engagement in redox changes was provided by representing NICS(1) values versus HOMA and the new geometric distortion parameter HOMQc8.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of new Withaferin A inspired Hedgehog pathway inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Withanolides constitute a well&#8208;known family of plant&#8208;based alkaloids characterised by widespread biological properties, including the ability of interfering with Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. Following our interest in natural products and in anticancer compounds, we report here the synthesis of a new class of Hh signalling pathway inhibitors, inspired by withaferin A, the first isolated member of withanolides. The decoration of our scaffolds was rationally supported by  in silico  studies, while functional evaluation revealed promising candidates, confirming once again the importance of natural products as inspiration source for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. A stereoselective approach, based on Brown chemistry, allowed the obtainment and the functional evaluation of the enantiopure hit compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent Organic Frameworks RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1 atm and 40 &#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;encoded Libraries: Hydrazide as a Pluripotent Precursor for on&#8208;DNA Synthesis of Various Azole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial chemical library (DEL) technology, an approach that combines the power of genetics and chemistry, has emerged as an invaluable tool in drug discovery. Skeletal diversity plays a fundamental importance in DEL applications, and relies heavily on novel DNA&#8208;compatible chemical reactions. We report herein a phylogenic chemical transformation strategy using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as a common versatile precursor in azole chemical expansion of DELs. DNA&#8208;compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>

Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes: Highly efficient photoluminescence was achieved in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum using strong s&#8208;donating cyclometalated NHC ligands and a dianionic (N&#8201;N)&#8208;type bidentate as the ancillary ligand. Detailed photophysical investigations supported by density functional theory calculations provide insights into the excited&#8208;state properties of this new class of emitter molecules. The realization of the first solution&#8208;processable OLED device based on these strongly luminescent gold(III) carbene emitter systems opens up exciting new opportunities in light emitting applications.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NMR spectroscopy&lt;/b&gt;: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the An&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling Luminescent IrI and RhI N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Structure, Photophysical Specifics, and Cellular Localization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anticancer NHC complexes: RhI and IrI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes provide an auspicious class of potential new anticancer agents; however, cellular imaging with luminescent derivatives of these complex types is often hampered by luminescence quenching. Building on an analysis of the parameters for metal&#8208;induced quenching processes, new examples of this complex class are designed with properties suitable for cellular imaging. Their main localization in the endoplasmic reticulum is not only an unprecedented finding but also represents the first ever insight into the cellular localization of Ir(NHC) complexes in the oxidation state +I.







Abstract
Complexes of RhI and IrI of the [M(COD)(NHC)X] type (where M=Rh or Ir, COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and X=halide) have recently shown promising cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines. Initial mechanism of action studies provided some knowledge about their interaction with DNA and proteins. However, information about their cellular localization remains scarce owing to luminescence quenching within this complex type. Herein, the synthesis of two rare examples of luminescent RhI and IrI [M(COD)(NHC)I] complexes with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based emitting ligands is reported. All new complexes are comprehensively characterized, including with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures. Steric crowding in one derivative leads to two distinct rotamers in solution, which apparently can be distinguished both by pronounced NMR shifts and by their respective spectral and temporal emission signatures. When the photophysical properties of these new complexes are exploited for cellular imaging in HT&#8208;29 and PT&#8208;45 cancer cell lines, it is demonstrated that the complexes accumulate predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is an entirely new finding and provides the first insight into the cellular localization of such IrI(NHC) complexes.

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Conformational Switching through the One&#8208;Electron Reduction of an Acridinium&#8208;based, &#947;&#8208;Cationic Phosphine Gold Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it: The reduction of the acridinium&#8208;based &#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold chloride complex neutralizes the carbenium unit and affords a stable radical. Due to a perturbation of the electrostatic potential profile of the complex and donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions, this reduction alters the complex's conformation, with the linear phosphine&#8208;gold&#8208;chloride moiety undergoing a windshield&#8208;wiper&#8208;type motion over the surface of the acridinium ring.







Abstract
Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8211;carbenium interaction present in these complexes. Here, it was shown that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [(o&#8208;Ph2P(C6H4)Acr)AuCl]+ (Acr=9&#8208;N&#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which showed a marked increase in the Au&#8211;Acr distance. Related structural changes were observed for the phosphine oxide analogue [(o&#8208;Ph2P(O)(C6H4)Acr]+, the reduction of which interfered with the P=O&#8594;carbenium interaction. These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electronic and electrostatic characteristics of the compounds, showed that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated. These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>

PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>

         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library&lt;/b&gt; (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIC drop! The first example and the spectroscopic characterization of a metal&#8208;bound as well as selenium&#8208;bound mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8208;radical of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type is reported. Design principles for stabilizing such radicals are presented as well.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. Herein, extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts are reported. It is found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO levels and the LUMO levels of the corresponding triazolylidene&#8208;based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversibility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type MIC&#8208;gold phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold&#8208;coordinated MIC radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.

&lt;p&gt;Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. Herein, extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts are reported. It is found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO levels and the LUMO levels of the corresponding triazolylidene&#8208;based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversibility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type MIC&#8208;gold phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species. Apart from UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold&#8208;coordinated MIC radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U[&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compound [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Th[&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; when reacted with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared&#8208;Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space for guests: Five isoreticular luminescent pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks showing CO2 uptake and the sensitive detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in aqueous solution are engineered. The NB&#8208;included framework provides direct evidence for framework&#8211;NB interactions.







Abstract
Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn2(dicarboxylate)2(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8901;x&#8201;DMF&#8901;y&#8201;H2O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (1), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (2), NH2&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (3), 2,6&#8208;ndc (4), and bpdc (5), have been engineered. MOFs 1&#8211;5 feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although 1&#8242; and 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195&#8197;K, MOF 2&#8242; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO2. Furthermore, MOF 3&#8242; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO2 uptake at high temperature due to the CO2&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs 1&#8211;5 revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (Ksv) of 2.93&#215;103, 1.79&#215;103, 3.78&#215;103, 4.04&#215;103, and 3.21&#215;103&#8201;m&#8722;1, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@3, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.

&lt;p&gt;Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dicarboxylate)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;DMF&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), 2,6&#8208;ndc (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and bpdc (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), have been engineered. MOFs &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 195&#8197;K, MOF &lt;b&gt;2&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, MOF &lt;b&gt;3&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake at high temperature due to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2.93&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.79&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 3.78&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 4.04&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 3.21&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids and Guest Molecules in a Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for glum are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of glum depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable glum values in the colloidal solution.

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is known that serotonin binds&lt;/b&gt; to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multiply Charged Helium Droplet Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine: The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep it simple! Thioamides resemble viable prebiotic building blocks for biologically relevant molecules. However, only a handful of experimental reports on parent thioformamide exist. X&#8208;ray diffraction data of thioformamide are reported and its tautomerization induced by UV irradiation under cryogenic conditions is presented. Four conformers of the corresponding thiolimine form, whose (tunneling) reactivity is investigated.







Abstract
As sulfur&#8208;containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, for example, in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here, we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45&#8197;min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20&#8197;K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.

         <title>Tunable Anticancer Activity of Furoylthiourea&#8208;Based RuII&#8211;Arene Complexes and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.

         <dc:description>
Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.&lt;/p&gt;
