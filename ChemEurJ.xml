         <title>Structural Dissection of Epsin&#8208;1 N&#8208;Terminal Helical Peptide: The Role of Hydrophobic Residues in Modulating Membrane Curvature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The induction of local changes in membrane structure often plays a pivotal role for cellular life. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein to induce positive membrane curvature and its N&#8208;terminal segment (EpN18) plays a key role. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 for a better understanding of general curvature&#8208;modulating mechanisms and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane structure.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal structural alterations in cellular membranes are the hallmark of many vital processes. In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles formation. Its N&#8208;terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature&#8208;inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i)&#8197;enhancing membrane interactions, (ii)&#8197;helix structuring, (iii)&#8197;inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv)&#8197;loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was obtained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa&#8208;arginine cell&#8208;penetrating peptides into living cells.

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacid Al(ORF)3 (RF=C(CF3)3): DFT Guided Identification of the &#8220;Stable yet Reactive&#8221; Adduct SiPr2&#8594;Al(ORF)3; Its Use as ORF&#8208; Abstractor from a &#8220;Ni&#8208;ORF&#8221; complex</title>

         <dc:description>
A predictive DFT study of L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct, able to act as a masked Lewis superacid. It provides a novel strategy to use M&#8208;ORF/L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 couples to generate catalytically active M+ centers featuring weakly coordinating aluminate counter anion.







Abstract
A DFT study of several L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L=Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 1&#8208;SiPr2 as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct. 1&#8208;SiPr2 was shown to act as a masked Lewis superacid able to release Al(ORF)3 under mild conditions. It could be used to abstract a ORF&#8722; ligand from (bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)2 (bipyMe2&#8201;:&#8201;6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl) and generate the nickel alkoxide complex [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(iPr2S)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 5. Ligand exchange of iPr2S by Ph3P yielded [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(PPh3)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8722;F&#8722;Al(ORF)3]&#8722; 6.

         <title>CO&#8208;Preserving Photoinduced Transfer of Cymantrenyl Moiety: a Tandem Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;exchangable CO: When one observes that the reaction product contains the same quantity of CO ligands as the substrate, it is natural to suspect that they do not detach during the reaction. We present a reaction where this is not the case and highlight the role of cage effect in this conundrum.







Abstract
Cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (cymantrene) is known to undergo photochemical reactions by releasing one of its CO ligands. Here we present the first example of a photorearrangement of a cymantrenylmethyl fragment, where it retains all its three CO ligands. A tandem experimental and DFT (density functional theory)&#8208;based computational investigation allows us to explain this unexpected behavior: the rearrangement, indeed, begins with the release of one CO ligand, but cage effect of the solvent captures this CO molecule, allowing it to rapidly reattach once the rearrangement takes place.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcoming limitations: Deracemization represents an attractive strategy for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. How to compensate for the decrease in entropy and prevent microreversibility pose two unavoidable challenges. In recent years, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven asymmetric photocatalysis has been recognized as a promising tool to overcome the limitations, given that a number of deracemization reactions have been established. This review summarizes and discusses these important achievements.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis has long been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. In addition to precise enantiocontrol, high&#8208;atom economy, which is crucial for practicality, has always been pursued by chemists in the development of methodologies. Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100&#8201;% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated to be a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success is its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents, thus undermining the original advantages. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single&#8208;electron transfer in photocatalysis.

         <title>Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based drug design process is used to build inhibitors for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cholesterol oxidase enzymes CYP125 and CYP142. Elaboration of initial fragment screen used an iterative approach combining high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures, biophysical characterization, and structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). The resulting compounds yielded potent micromolar cellular activity against clinically relevant drug resistant Mtb strains.







Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host&#8208;derived lipids such as cholesterol not only support Mtb growth, but are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure&#8208;guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in&#8208;cell activity against clinically relevant drug&#8208;resistant isolates were obtained. These will incite further development of much&#8208;needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb pathogenesis.

         <title>Vanadium Pentafulvene Complexes: Synthon for Unprecedented VanadoceneIII Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) is exchanged with pentafulvenes to yield the first vanadium complexes with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordinating pentafulvene. Consecutive reactivity studies concerning element&#8208;H activation and insertion reactions of multiple bond containing substrates produced rare examples of vandoceneIII phenolate, alcoholate, and amide complexes with certain structure elucidation by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8722;C6H6) (1) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b) and benzofulvene complexes (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordination mode with a vanadiumIII center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6&#8208;dimethylpentafulvene, a C&#8722;H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring&#8208;substituted vanadoceneII 4. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadoceneIII compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E&#8722;H splitting of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadoceneIII phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V&#8722;Cexo bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4&#8208;chlorobenzonitril and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

         <title>Regulation of the Oxidase Mimetic Activity of Ceria Nanoparticles by Buffer Composition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes: The buffer compositions have different effects on the oxidase mimetic activity of ceria nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) are important typical nanozymes with multiple enzyme mimetic activities, which could facilitate the oxidation of organic dyes in acidic conditions, because of the oxidase mimetic activity. Usually, the regulation of oxidase mimetic activity is focused on the adjustment of the structure, morphology, composition, surface, and other factors of nanozymes. However, the influence of the surrounding environment is not considered, which is very important during the reaction process. In this work, the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs in buffer solutions including citric acid, acetic acid and glycine buffer solutions was investigated, with the results that carboxyl group in buffer solution could adsorb the CNPs on the surface to promote the oxidase mimetic activity. Due to the chelation with the cerium ion, the enhancement is more significant by molecules with polycarboxylic groups, and the enhancement is more efficient by carboxyl molecules in buffer solution, compared with the modification of the carboxyl groups on the surface, because of easier operation and smaller steric hindrance. From the viewpoint of increasing the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs, the work is expected to provide references for the selection of the reaction systems to optimize the oxidase mimetic activity in bio&#8208;detection applications.

         <title>Insight of Cd2+ removal by MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions</title>

         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown great potential as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. Nevertheless, howthe host&#8208;guest interactions of LDHs affect the removal mechanism remains to be less explored. Herein, we fabricated CO32&#8208;/NO3&#8208;/SO42&#8208;/Cl&#8208; intercalated MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions and investigated their removal mechanism for Cd2+. The removal capacity increased in the order of MgAl&#8208;CO3 (127.3 mg/g) &lt; MgAl&#8208;SO4 (173.3 mg/g) &lt; MgAl&#8208;NO3 (305.0 mg/g) &#8776; MgAl&#8208;Cl (312.5 mg/g). The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ XRD and XAS demonstrated that Cd2+ was removed in the form of CdCO3 for MgAl&#8208;CO3, while for MgAl&#8208;Cl/NO3/SO4, Cd2+ was all removed in the form of CdAl&#8208;LDHs with isomorphic substitution mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that the lower Gibbs free energy in the formation of CdCO3 than CdAl&#8208;LDHs made it easier to remove Cd2+ by CdCO3 on MgAl&#8208;CO3. Conversely, isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8208;NO3 to CdAl&#8208;LDHs was a free energy reduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine ligated by an acridane derived NNN pincer ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The steric tuning of a tridentate acridane&#8208;derived NNN pincer ligand allows for the isolation of a strictly T&#8208;shaped phosphine that exhibits ambiphilic reactivity. Well&#8208;defined phosphorus&#8208;centered reactivity towards nucleophiles and electrophiles is reported, contrasting with prior reports on this class of compounds. Reactions towards oxidants are also described. The latter result in the two&#8208;electron oxidation of the phosphorus atom from +III to +V, and are accompanied by a strong geometric distortion of the NNN pincer ligand. By contrast, cooperative activation of E&#8211;H (HCl, HBcat, HOMe) bonds proceeds with retention of the phosphorus redox state. When using H2O as a substrate, the reaction results in the full disassembly of H2O to its constituent atoms, highlighting the potential of this platform for small molecule activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of alkenes with acylhydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acylsilanes are an important class of organosilicon compounds that have gained increased attention recently. Their various reaction modes in particularly their ability to generate carbenes under thermal or photochemical conditions render them valuable reagents in organic synthesis. In this communication, an unprecedented route towards acylsilanes is reported by introducing the acylsilane moiety directly in a single step through alkene hydrosilylation. In this context, acylhydrosilanes representing a novel class of acylsilanes are introduced and applied as silylation reagents in rhodium catalyzed alkene hydrosilylations to access a great variety of acylsilanes. These reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance and atom economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Nickel Cobalt Phosphide Nanocrosses with Well&#8208;Defined Axial Arms for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concave nanostructure with highly branched architecture and abundant step atoms is one kind of desirable materials for energy conversion devices. However, current synthetic strategies for non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based NiCoP concave nanostructure still remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a site&#8208;selective chemical etching and subsequent phosphorating strategy to fabricate highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses (HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs). The HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs are consisted of six axial arms in three&#8208;dimensional space and each protruding arm is equipped with high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks. As an electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction, the HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs exhibit remarkably enhanced activity and stability, with small overpotential of 289 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2, surpassing the NiCoP nanocages and commercial RuO2. The superior OER performance of HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs is originated from the highly branched concave structure, the synergistic effect between bimetal Ni and Co atoms, as well as the electronic structure modulation from P.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide&#8208;Substituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Salts as Useful Synthetic Synthons: Access to Triazenyl Radicals and Staudinger type Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic carbenes (MIC) are a popular class of compound that are heavily investigated at the moment. The access to cationic MICs, and the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals are two highly attractive fields that have hardly been explored until now. Here we report the synthesis and characterisation of three different cationic azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts, used as building blocks for the study of their reactivity towards triphenylphosphine, where the reactivity is dependent on the nature of the starting triazolium salt. Furthermore, we have used the cationic triazolium salts to develop a series of unsymmetrical MIC&#8208;triazene&#8208;NHC/MIC&#8217; compounds, which can be readily converted to the radical form either via electrochemical or chemical methods. These radicals, which display NIR electrochromism, were investigated using a battery of techniques such as electrochemistry, UV/Vis/NIR and, EPR spectroelectrochemistry and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the MIC plays an important role in the stabilization of the triazenyl radical, particularly in a competitive role vis a vis their NHC counterparts. These results shed new light into the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals, and possibly also on their &#960;&#8208;accepting ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Solution and Solid&#8208;state Emitters &#8211; Robust Imaging Agents for Cells, Bacteria and Protists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of eight different cationic emitters with emission properties in solution and in solid&#8208;state (solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; SSSE) is presented. These compounds, bearing either ammonium or pyridinium groups, have been investigated regarding their photophysical properties as well as their potential application in biological imaging. Besides high quantum yields as well as a high degree of stability during the imaging process, it was additionally revealed that a broad range of biological targets can be addressed, such as different bacterial strains, human cells as well as protists. The reported SSSE approach employing the mentioned robust emitters for biological imaging, will contribute to a rapid and facile way to design and apply affordable emitters with outstanding properties. Additionally, these emitters will overcome the drawbacks of classical luminophores and agents featuring well&#8208;known aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning the Properties of Stapled Peptides by Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids were used as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs library of an IL&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the staples chirality (L/D) impacts on the peptide&#8216;s properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and binding affinity of the modified peptide compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges.







Abstract
Peptide stapling represents a versatile strategy to generate peptide derivatives with stable helical structures. While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated &#945;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs of an interleukin&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the interleukin&#8208;17A(IL&#8208;17A)&#8208;binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (L/D) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL&#8208;17A&#8208;inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of Enantioenriched Epoxides and Triols from Biomass&#8208;Derived Synthons Driven by Specifically Designed Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the design and application of multi&#8208;step enzymatic cascades to synthesize enantioenriched epoxides and vicinal aromatic triols from simple biomass&#8208;derived starting materials in one pot. These artificial metabolic pathways involve a tailor&#8208;made aldolase, a highly evolved cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme, and when needed a specifically chosen epoxide hydrolase. These attractive biocatalytic cascades can be performed under environmentally benign conditions, such as the use of aqueous media and mild temperatures, and do not require the isolation of reaction intermediates. Good to excellent conversions, high enantioselectivity, and moderate to good product yields are achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor&#8208;made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an effective aldolase with 160&#8208;fold increased activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4&#8208;OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4&#8208;OT mutant, in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) from biomass&#8208;derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68&#8201;% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three&#8208;step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3&#8208;prim,sec,sec&#8208;triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor&#8208;less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass&#8208;based synthons.

         <title>Enhanced performance of CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell by modified zinc oxide nanorods array with [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Metal oxide ZnO is widely used as electron transport layers in all&#8208;inorganic PSCs due to high electron mobility, high transmittance, and simple preparation processing, the surface defects of ZnO suppress the quality of perovskite film and inhibit the solar cells&#8217; performance. In this work, [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PCBA) modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) is employed as electron transport layer&#160;in perovskite solar cells.&#160;The resulting perovskite film coated on the zinc oxide nanorods has better crystallinity and uniformity, facilitating charge carrier transportation, reducing recombination losses, and ultimately improving the cells&#8217; performance. The perovskite solar cell with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO nanorods/PCBA/CsPbIBr2/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au delivers a high short circuit current density of 11.83 mA cm&#8208;2 and power conversion efficiency of 12.05 %.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides as a novel tool for conformational modification in peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of 15 cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine and 10 cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides containing one or two backbone N&#8208;aryl amide bonds were synthesized by following a combination of solution phase and solid phase peptide synthesis. NMR based conformational studies of these N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine peptides have revealed five distinct template conformations with antiparallel beta sheet structure, and that of N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides have revealed three template structures. All the template structures have distinct peptide turn features. The conformations in theseN&#8208;aryl peptides were compared to those in the commonly studied N&#8208;methyl peptide analogs. We observed that the N&#8208;aryl peptides have exhibited a considerable conformational homogeneity, and their conformations have significantly differed from those in N&#8208;methyl analogs. We anticipate that the N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides has the potential for its application as a novel tool for conformational and physicochemical modification in peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Metalated Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azomethineylide [3+2] cycloadditions are a promising strategy for the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidines. In this Review, recent developments in the enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition of azomethine ylide by metal catalysis are summarized.







Abstract
Asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition reactions are fascinating and powerful methods for the synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolidines up to four stereocentres. Pyrrolidines are important compounds for both biology and organocatalytic applications. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of pyrrolidines by [3+2] cycloadditions of azomethine ylides using metal catalysis. It has been organized by the type of metal catalysis used and further arranged by the complexity nature of dipolarophile. The presentation of each reaction type highlights their advantages and limitations.

         <title>Small Molecule Activation on a Base&#8208;stabilized Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene towards N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and H&#8722;E (E=Si, P, B) bonds was studied. Reactions of the P(I) species with unsaturated compounds, such as tetrachlorobenzaquinone, benzaldehyde and phenylisocyanate, was also investigated.







Abstract
Reduction of (NP)PCl2 (NP=phosphinoamidinate [PhC(NAr)(=NPPri2)]&#8722;) with KC8 affords the phosphinoamidinato&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P (9). Reaction of 9 with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (MeC(NMe))2C: results in the NHC&#8208;adduct NHC&#8594;P&#8722;P(Pri2)=NC(Ph)=NAr featuring an iminophosphinyl group. Reactions of 9 with HBpin and H3SiPh led to the metathesis products (NP)Bpin and (NP)SiH2Ph, respectively, whereas with HPPh2 a base&#8208;stabilized phosphido&#8208;phosphinidene, the product of N&#8722;P and H&#8722;P bond metathesis, was obtained. Reaction of 9 with tetrachlorobenzaquinone results in oxidation of P(I) to P(III), accompanied by oxidation of the amidophosphine ligand into P(V). Addition of benzaldehyde to 9 results in a phospha&#8208;Wittig reaction affording a product of P=P and C=O bond metathesis. Related reaction with phenylisocyanate results in a product of N&#8722;P(=O)Pri2 addition to the C=N bond of an intermediate iminophosphaalkene to produce a phosphinidene intramolecularly stabilized by a diaminocarbene.

         <title>Efficient K&#8208;Storage of Fe&#8208;Coupled Organic Molecule Anode in Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal coupling strategy combined with electrolytes regulation are adopted to develop a novel organic K&#8208;storage anode of Fe&#8208;NTCDA with improved specific capacity and long cycle stability in the optimized 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes, attributed to the increased K&#8208;storage sites as well as enhanced K+ transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Given these advantages of widely designable structures and environmentally friendly characteristics, organic electrode materials (OEMs) are considered to be promising electrode materials for alkaline metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, their large&#8208;scale application is hampered by insufficient specific capacity and rate performance. Here, Fe2+ is coupled to the anhydride molecule NTCDA to form a novel K&#8208;storage anode Fe&#8208;NTCDA. In this way, the working potential of Fe&#8208;NTCDA anode is reduced, which makes it more suitable to be used as an anode material. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved due to the increase in K&#8208;storage sites. Moreover, electrolytes regulation is implemented to optimize the K&#8208;storage behavior, resulting into a high specific capacity of 167&#8197;mAh/g after 100 cycles at 50&#8197;mA/g and 114&#8197;mAh/g even at 500&#8197;mA/g in the 3&#8197;M KFSI/DME electrolytes.

         <title>No Transition Metals Required &#8211; Oxygen Promoted Synthesis of Imines from Primary Alcohols and Amines under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal free: The synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohol and anilines promoted by oxygen and KOtBu at room temperature in the absence of a transition metal catalyst is described. The detailed investigation of the radical mechanism is presented revealing complex reaction paths and branching patterns.







Abstract
The synthesis of imines denotes a cornerstone in organic chemistry. The use of alcohols as renewable substituents for carbonyl&#8208;functionality represents an attractive opportunity. Consequently, carbonyl moieties can be in&#8197;situ generated from alcohols upon transition&#8208;metal catalysis under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, bases can be utilized under aerobic conditions. In this context, we report the synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohols and anilines, promoted by KOtBu under aerobic conditions at room temperature, in the absence of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst. A detailed investigation of the radical mechanism of the underlying reaction is presented. This reveals a complex reaction network fully supporting the experimental findings.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transition-metal free&lt;/b&gt;: The synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohol and anilines promoted by oxygen and KO&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu at room temperature in the absence of a transition metal catalyst is described. The detailed investigation of the radical mechanism is presented revealing complex reaction paths and branching patterns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of imines denotes a cornerstone in organic chemistry. The use of alcohols as renewable substituents for carbonyl-functionality represents an attractive opportunity. Consequently, carbonyl moieties can be in&#8197;situ generated from alcohols upon transition-metal catalysis under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, bases can be utilized under aerobic conditions. In this context, we report the synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohols and anilines, promoted by KO&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu under aerobic conditions at room temperature, in the absence of any transition-metal catalyst. A detailed investigation of the radical mechanism of the underlying reaction is presented. This reveals a complex reaction network fully supporting the experimental findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Based Cuboid Constructed by Chiral Self&#8208;Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuboid, a basic geometric structure, has been widely applied in architecture and mathematics. In chemistry, the introduction of cuboid structures always provides a specific structural shape, enhances the stability of the structure and improves the performance of materials. In this study, we propose a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;discrimination to construct a cuboid&#8208;stacking crystal material, in which a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) based on Tr&#246;ger's base (TB) and benzophenone (BP) was synthesized as the building element of the cuboid. The cuboid is designed to be transformable compared with cuboid structures in previous work. For this reason, it is considering that the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure can be transformed through external stimulation. Iodine vapor is selected as the external stimulus to transform the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure due to the favorable interaction between iodine and the cuboid. The changes in the stacking mode of TBBP is studied by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). To our surprise, this Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;based cuboid shows strong iodine adsorption capacity up to 3.43 g g&#8722;1 and exhibits potential as a crystal material for iodine adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Hydroxyl Group&#8208;Assisted Preparation of Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adjustable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework UiO&#8208;66 Composites: Towards Continuous Oil Collection and Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a straightforward and effective hydrophobic modification for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) under mild conditions is meaningful for MOF applications. Here, a post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8208;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid (TPA) is the essential force for the modifier TPA. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for efficient oil&#8208;water separation by coating TPA&#8208;modified UiO&#8208;66 (P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) on commercial melamine sponges (MS) and filter papers (FP). The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS composite could quickly and selectively absorb oily liquids up to 43 times its weight from water. P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/FP and P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS showed high separation efficiencies for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, respectively, with high resistance to low/high temperatures and acid/base conditions. The metal hydroxyl group&#8208;assisted post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy offers a facile and broad way to prepare hydrophobic MOFs for promising applications in environmental fields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of perylenediimide (PDI) building blocks in materials for organic electronic is of considerable interest. This popular n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is tuned by introducing peripheral groups in their ortho and bay positions. Such modifications radically alter their optoelectronic properties. In this article, we describe an efficient method to afford regioisomerically pure 1,6/7&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208; and (NH2)2&#8208;PDIs employing two key steps: the selective crystallization of 1,6&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxy tetrabutylester and the nitration of regiopure 1,7&#8208;Br2&#8208;PDI with silver nitrite. The optoelectronic properties of the resulting regioisomerically pure dinitro, diamino&#8208;PDIs and bisazacoronenediimides (BACDs) are reported and demonstrate the need to separate both regioisomers of such n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for their inclusion in advanced optoelectronic devices. For the first time, the two regioisomers of the same PDI starting material are available on the multigram scale, which will stimulate the exploration of regioisomerism/properties relationship for this family of dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>To Isomerize or not to Isomerize?
E  /Z&#160;Isomers of Cyclic Azobenzene Derivatives and their Reactivity upon One&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azo compounds are efficient electron acceptors. Upon one&#8208;electron reduction they generally isomerize forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. Here we show that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species. Markedly, diazonines, which bear a central nine membered heterocycle, show light induced&#160;E/Z&#160;isomerization, but retain the configuration of the diazene N=N moiety upon one&#8208;electron reduction. Accordingly,&#160;E/Z&#160;isomerization is not induced by reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Low Impact Acetalization Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of acetals in acidic Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) in which the solvent itself participates in the catalytic promotion of the reaction is herein reported. The reaction is performed under feasible conditions, open air, without the need of external additives, catalysts or water removing techniques and it is wide in scope. The products are easily recovered and the reaction medium is fully recycled and reused without weakening of its catalytic activity after 10 times. Remarkably, the entire process has been realized on gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Four New Sb&#8208;based Orthophosphates: Cation Regulation to Investigate Diversified Structural Architecture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the work, four new Sb&#8208;based phosphates, K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3, Rb(SbO2)2PO4, Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32, were successfully synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature melt method. Among them, Rb(SbO2)2PO4 and Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 are the first reported examples of Rb&#8208;containing alkali metal Sb&#8208;based phosphates. They show three&#8208;dimensional (3D) frameworks composed of [Sb8P4O30]&#8734; layer for K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3 and [Sb6P2O20]&#8734; layer for Rb(SbO2)2PO4, and 2D lamellar structure composed of [Sb3P2O10]&#8734; for Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32. A detailed structural comparison shows that the structure dimensions for them transfer from 1D to complex 3D framework with the increase of (Sb+P)/O ratio, which affects performances of the compounds. Optical property and energy band structure calculations were also carried out based on the density functional theory (DFT). The present study enriches the diversity of Sb&#8208;based phosphates and paves the way for further explore their optical properties in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bridge Controlled Patterning of BTR:PC71BM Bulk Heterojunction Micro Arrays towards High&#8208;performance Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The patterning strategy of organic semiconductors&#160;is&#160;a crucial&#160;issue for integrated circuit. However, due to the uncontrollable liquid dewetting, most of the research is mainly focused on the patterning of single component, few works have been done on the patterning of multi&#8208;component or heterojunction, which play an important role in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, a capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for patterning of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) micro&#8208;arrays, with liquid crystalline BTR and PC71BM utilized as donor and acceptor, respectively. The BTR:PC71BM arrays&#160;presented&#160;hierarchical morphology with suitable phase separation, which contributes to the efficient charge generation and transport. Moreover, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance&#160;with&#160;the light on/off ratio higher than 2000, the responsivity of 40.57 A W&#8722;1, and specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#160;Jones. Such progress demonstrates that the capillary&#8208;bridge strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality BHJ micropatterns arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Solid Phase Glycan Synthesis: ASGS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid phase synthesis is the most dominant approach for the preparation of biological oligomers as it enables the introduction of monomers iteratively. Accelerated solid phase synthesis of biological oligomers is crucial for chemical biology, but its application to the synthesis of oligosaccharides is not trivial. Solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide assembly is a slow process performed in a variety of conditions and temperatures, requires an inert gas atmosphere, and demands high excess of glycosyl donors. The process is done in special synthesizers and poor mixing of the solid support increases the risk of diffusion&#8208;independent hydrolysis of the activated donors. High shear stirring is a new way to accelerate solid phase synthesis. The efficient mixing ensures that reactive intermediates can diffuse faster to the solid support thereby increasing the kinetics of the reactions. We report here a stirring&#8208;based accelerated solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis. We harnessed high shear mixing to perform diffusion&#8208;dependent glycosylation in a short reaction time. We minimized the use of glycosyl donors and the need to use an inert atmosphere. We showed that by tailoring the deprotection and glycosylation conditions to the same temperature, assembly steps are performed continuously, and full glycosylation cycles is completed in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Chiral Resolution of a MnIII Spin Crossover Complex with High&#160;Temperature 80 K Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;centrosymmetric spin switchable systems are of interest for their prospective applications as magnetically active non&#8208;linear optical materials and in multiferroic devices. Chiral resolution of simple spin crossover chelates complexes into the &#916; and &#923; forms offers a facile route to homochiral magnetic switches, which could be easily enantiomerically enriched. Here, we report the spontaneous resolution of new hysteretic spin crossover complex, [MnIII(sal2323)]SCN&#183;EtOH (1), into &#916; and &#923; forms, without the use of chiral reagents, where sal2323 is the Schiff base resulting from condensation of 1,2&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropylamino)ethane with 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. The enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism, and quantum chemistry calculations were used to investigate the electronic structure. The opening of a wide&#160;80 K&#160;thermal hysteresis window at high temperature&#160;highlights the potential for good magneto&#8208;optical function at ambient temperature for&#160;materials of this type.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Aromaticity of an Alternating Cyclo[4]Thiophene[4]Furan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on a new class of conjugated macrocycle, the cyclo[4]thiophene[4]furan hexyl ester (C4TE4FE). This cycle consists of alternating alpha&#8208;linked thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;ester and furan&#8208;3&#8208;ester repeat units, and was prepared in a single step using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)furan monomer. The ester side groups help promote a syn conformation of the heterocycles, which enables formation of the macrocycle. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that C4TE4FE could undergo multiple oxidations, so treatment with SbCl5 resulted in formation of the [C4TE4FE]2+ dication. Computational work, paired with 1H NMR spectroscopy of the dication, revealed that the cycle becomes globally aromatic upon 2e&#8208; oxidation, as the annulene pathway along the outer ring becomes H&#252;ckel aromatic. The change in ring current for the cycle upon oxidation was clear from 1H NMR spectroscopy, as the protons of the thiophene and furan rings shifted downfield by nearly 6 ppm. This work highlights the potential of sequence control in furan&#8208;based macrocycles to tune electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfuric resources. However, their commercial application is limited by rapid capacity decline and low Coulombic efficiency. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) made of metallic nodes and organic ligands can suppress polysulfide shuttling and promote redox kinetics. In this paper, the effects of crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories on chemical performance of LSBs have been meticulously explored electrochemical performance. As a result, exposed Ni active sites in a lamellar Ni&#8208;MOF was found to deliver a superior electrochemical performance. The as&#8208;assembled LSBs with 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs cathode deliver a much superior initial discharge capacity, (820 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C), and exhibit excellent cycling stability over 550 cycles than those analogues of 3D stereoscopic Ni&#8208;MOF and 2D lamellar Co&#8208;MOF. This work proposed a perspective in elevating LSBs performance through synergistic optimization of the MOFs dimensions and the metallic nuclei in the cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Numerical simulation and experimental study of methyl ammonium bismuth iodide absorber layer based lead free perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed a tremendous surge in the design and fabrication of lead&#8208;(Pb) free perovskite or perovskite&#8208;like materials for the construction of perovskite solar cells. The simulation and fabrication of Pb free perovskite&#8208;like structures based perovskite solar cells are of great significance. In present study, we have simulated methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) based perovskite solar cells using solar cell capacitance software (SCAPS). The thickness of the electron&#8208;transport layer, hole&#8208;transport layer and absorber layer were optimized via SCAPS. The simulated perovskite solar cells (FTO/TiO2/MA3Bi2I9/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au) with optimized conditions demonstrated good power conversion efficiency of 14.07% with reasonable open circuit voltage of 1.34 V via SCAPS. In further studies, we also fabricated perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity which showed power conversion efficiency of 1.31%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Ketyl Radical Initiated Cketyl&#8208;Csp2/Csp3&#160;Coupling on ZnIn2S4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8211;C bond formation utilizing ketyl radical (Cketyl) species has attracted increasing attention recently, as it provides a direct route for the synthesis of complex molecules. However, the most&#8208;developed homogeneous photocatalytic systems for the generation and utilization of ketyl radicals usually entail noble metal&#8208;based (e.g., Ru and Ir) photosensitizers, which suffer from not only high cost but also potential degradation and hence pose challenges in product separation and purification. In contrast, readily accessible, inexpensive, and recyclable semiconductors represent attractive alternative photocatalysts but remain much less explored for photocatalytic ketyl radical initiated C&#8211;C bond formation. Herein, we demonstrate that a wide range of industrially important chemicals, including substituted chromanes and tertiary alcohols, can be produced on ZnIn2S4 under visible light irradiation through intra&#8208;molecular cyclization (Cketyl&#8211;Csp2) and inter&#8208;molecular cross&#8208;coupling (Cketyl&#8211;Csp3) reactions, respectively, using ketyl radicals. A suite of experimental studies aided by computational investigation were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic insights of these two types of ketyl radical initiated C&#8211;C coupling reactions on ZnIn2S4.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridone&#8208;Doped Acenes with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Besides the peripheral modification, the introduction of heteroatoms to modulate the property of longer acenes with improved chemical stability has been extensively studied for their potential applications in organic electronics. However, the utilization of 4&#8208;pyridone, a common unit in the air&#8208; and photo&#8208;stable acridone and quinacridone, to decorate higher acenes with increased stability has not been realized yet. Here we present the synthesis of a series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes up to heptacene via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination of aniline and dibromo&#8208;ketone. The effect of pyridone on the property of doped acenes were investigated experimentally and computationally. With the &#960;&#8208;extension of doped acenes, the pyridone ring shows the weakened conjugation and gradual loss of aromaticity. The doped acenes demonstrate enhanced stability in solution and maintain the electron communication between the acene planes.</dc:description>

         <title>Au nanozyme driven cascading catalysis in Tollens' reaction: An insight of glucose oxidase&#8208;like mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven to be excellent glucose oxidase (GOx) mimics, which can catalyze the electrons transform pathway from glucose to oxygen. This study confirmed AuNPs can accelerate the reaction between [Ag(NH3)2]+&#160;and glucose under alkaline conditions, which is also known as the Tollens'&#160;reaction, and the possible mechanism was proposed. Here, [Ag(NH3)2]+ instead of O2 acted directedly as an electron acceptor during glucose oxidation catalyzed by AuNPs, accompanied by hydrogen transfer. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanoparticles can also catalyze this process, similar to AuNPs, via a unique cascading catalysis mechanism in the Tollens' reaction. A simple and heatless glucose colorimetric assay can be established based on the plasmonic band of AgNPs with a liner range of 0.6&#8211;22.2 &#956;M, and the limit of detection is 0.32 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>DFT mechanistic investigation on manganese pincer complex catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper the density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to investigate the cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate catalyzed by Mn&#8208;PNN pincer complex. The whole reaction process mainly includes three stages: the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the coupling of benzaldehyde with methanol to hemiacetal and the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal to methyl benzoate. The calculated results indicated that two dehydrogenation processes are influenced by two competitive mechanisms of inner and outer spheres. Dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is the rate&#8208;determining step of the whole reaction, with the energy barrier of 22.1 kcal/mol. In addition, the regeneration of catalyst is also extremely important. Compared with direct dehydrogenation, the dehydrogenation mode assisted by formic acid is more advantageous. This work might provide theoretical insights and shed light on the design of cheap transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Hybrid Composed of Anisotropic Niobate Layers Modified with MoC Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hybrid composed of anisotropic niobate layers modified with MoC nanoparticles is synthesized by multistep reactions. The stepwise interlayer reactions for layered hexaniobate induce selective surface modification at the alternate interlayers and the following ultrasonication leads to the formation of double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The further liquid phase MoC deposition with the double layered nanosheets leads to the decoration of MoC nanoparticles on the surfaces of the double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The new hybrid can be regarded as a stacking of the two layers with anisotropically modified nanoparticles. The relatively high temperature in the MoC synthesis causes partial leaching of the grafted phosphonate groups, and the exposed surface of the niobate nanosheets due to the partial leaching may interact with MoC to succeed the hybridization. The hybrid after heating exhibits photocatalytic activity, indicating that this hybridization method can be useful for hybrid synthesis of semiconductor nanosheets and co&#8208;catalyst nanoparticles toward photocatalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Tetrathiafulvalene and Nickel&#8722;Bis(dithiolene) Units into Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Stable and Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) are typical conductive units widely studied in electronics, optics, and photochemistry. However, their applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion are often limited by insufficient NIR absorption and low chemical/thermal stability. Herein, we integrate TTF and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) into a covalent organic framework (COF) with stable and efficient NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance. Two isostructural COFs, namely Ni&#8208;TTF and TTF&#8208;TTF, are successfully isolated which are composed of TTF and Ni&#8722;bis(dithiolene) units as donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) pairs or TTF units only. Both COFs show high BET surface areas and good chemical/thermal stability. Notably, compared with TTF&#8208;TTF, the periodic D&#8208;A arrangement in Ni&#8208;TTF significantly lowers the bandgap, leading to unprecedented NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanol&#8208;Supported Lanthanide Complexes for Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence at 1550 nm.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) at 1550 nm is reported from lanthanide complexes supported by Vanol; these are the first examples of coordination of Vanol to lanthanides. A change in the ligand design from a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (in Binol) to a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol (in Vanol) results in significantly improved dissymmetry factors for (Vanol)3ErNa3 (|glum| = 0.64) at 1550 nm. This is the highest reported dissymmetry factor to date in the telecom C&#8208;band region, and among the highest for any lanthanide complexes. Comparative solid&#8208;state structural analysis of (Vanol)3ErNa3 and (Binol)3ErNa3 suggests that a less distorted geometry around the metal center is in part responsible for the high chiroptical metrics of (Vanol)3ErNa3. This phenomenon was further evidenced in the analogous ytterbium complexes (Vanol)3YbNa3 that also exhibit significantly improved dissymmetry factors (|glum| = 0.21). This confirms and generalizes the same observation that was made in other visibly emitting, six&#8208;coordinate lanthanide complexes. Due to their strong CPL at 1550 nm, the reported complexes are potential candidates for applications in quantum communication technologies. More importantly, our structure&#8208;CPL activity relationship study provides guidance towards the generation of even better near infrared&#8208;CPL emitters.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of self&#8208;assembling gluconamide conjugated naphthalimide amphiphiles (GCNA) was synthesized and the self&#8208;assembly of GCNA into gel rendered an increased electron density in naphthalimide moiety with overall change in energy of 15.33x10&#8208;32 J via J&#8208;type aggregation. SEM analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction underpinning the nanofibrillar formation, and rheology confirmed the processablity and material fabrication. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA4 via cooperative intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions makes it as effective electron donor in the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The TENG based on GCNA4&#8208;polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) triboelectric pair generated an output voltage, current and power density of ~250 V, 40 &#956;A and ~622 mW/m2 respectively, which is almost 2.4 times better in performance than the amorphous GCNA4 based TENG. The fabricated TENG can power&#8208;up 240 LEDs, wrist watch, thermometer, calculator and hygrometer.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional cancer treatments have systematic side effects that stand against its desirable therapeutic efficacy. Alternative strategies using biochemical features of cancer cells to promote apoptosis are finding notable significance. One such important biochemical feature of malignant cells is hypoxia, alteration of which can lead to cell death. Hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF&#8208;1a) has the key role in hypoxia generation. Herein, we synthesized biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) that specifically diagnose and selectively killed cancer cells with 3&#8208;3.1&#8208;fold higher efficiency over non&#8208;cancer cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay in CoCDb treated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells confirmed the increased expression of HIF&#8208;1a that was responsible for efficient killing of cancer cells. In 2D cells and 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis that make CoCDb a potential theranostic agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Linkage Chemistry to Interlayer Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing methodology: Emerging strategies, such as linkage transformation strategy, bond protection strategy, and interlayer interaction engineering, have recently been developed to regulate the stability of 2D imine&#8208;linked COFs. This provides a facile solution to the instability of imine&#8208;linked COFs while simultaneously conserving their structural crystallinity and functionality.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (imine&#8208;COFs) represent the most sought&#8208;after class of COFs due to their broad monomer scope and ease of synthesis. Owing to the reversible nature of imine linkages, however, the chemical stability of most imine&#8208;COFs is still far from adequate. In this context, emerging strategies, ranging from linkage chemistry to interlayer interaction, have been employed to construct stable imine&#8208;COFs for their applications in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. This Concept article summarizes the latest advances aimed at tuning the structural stability of imine&#8208;COFs. Furthermore, this Concept provides a prospective for the precise design of stable imine&#8208;COFs based on the characteristics of structure, physical properties, and chemical functions, as well as the mechanism of structure locking and stabilization during crystal growth.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stabilizing methodology&lt;/b&gt;: Emerging strategies, such as linkage transformation strategy, bond protection strategy, and interlayer interaction engineering, have recently been developed to regulate the stability of 2D imine-linked COFs. This provides a facile solution to the instability of imine-linked COFs while simultaneously conserving their structural crystallinity and functionality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imine-linked covalent organic frameworks (imine-COFs) represent the most sought-after class of COFs due to their broad monomer scope and ease of synthesis. Owing to the reversible nature of imine linkages, however, the chemical stability of most imine-COFs is still far from adequate. In this context, emerging strategies, ranging from linkage chemistry to interlayer interaction, have been employed to construct stable imine-COFs for their applications in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. This Concept article summarizes the latest advances aimed at tuning the structural stability of imine-COFs. Furthermore, this Concept provides a prospective for the precise design of stable imine-COFs based on the characteristics of structure, physical properties, and chemical functions, as well as the mechanism of structure locking and stabilization during crystal growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Oxidation by a Tungsten Dependent Aldehyde Oxidoreductase from Aromatoleum Aromaticum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>

A bacterial W&#8208;dependent enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase catalyses the oxidation of a broad range of aldehyde to their carboxylic acids driven by electrochemistry at low applied potentials.







Abstract
In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes operate at significantly lower redox potentials, and in some cases they can carry out reversible redox transformations of their substrates and products. Still, the electrochemical properties of W enzymes have received much less attention than their Mo relatives. Herein we analyse the tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) from the mesophilic bacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum which has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode. This generates a functional system that electrochemically oxidises a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two&#8208;electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient catalytic process.

         <title>In&#8208;line Multidimensional NMR Monitoring of Photochemical Flow Reactions</title>

This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. Ultrafast 2D NMR experiments acquired in&#8208;line yield useful quantitative information in just 40&#8197;s.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. The reaction mixture exiting the flow reactor is flown through the NMR spectrometer and directly analyzed. In the case of simple substrates, suitable information can be obtained through 1D 1H spectra, but for molecules of higher complexity the use of 2D experiments is key to address signal overlaps and assignment issues. Here we show the usefulness of ultrafast 2D COSY experiments acquired in 70&#8197;s or less, for the in&#8208;line monitoring of photochemical reactions, and the possibility to obtain reliable quantitative information. This is a powerful framework to, for example, efficiently screen reaction conditions.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the chemistry of perfluoroalkylindium compounds is rather unexplored, here, we report on the syntheses and full characterization of a variety of salts featuring the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate anion, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;. The reaction of InCl3 with LiC2F5 selectively yields [Li(thf)n][In(C2F5)4], which is used as starting material for the syntheses of various [In(C2F5)4]&#8722; salts.







Abstract
In the rising field of organoindium chemistry little is known about the perfluoroorganyl&#8208;substituted indium compounds. The increasing use of indium reagents is explained by their high stability and tolerance towards water and functional groups. Here we report on the synthesis of the novel tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;, and its characterization in salts with the cations [Li(thf)3]+, Cs+, [PPh4]+ and [H14O6]2+ (thf=tetrahydrofuran). To the best of our knowledge, these salts constitute the first perfluoroalkylindates and, in general, the first isolated perfluoroalkylindium compounds which are fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>A Simple Four&#8208;Step Synthesis of the Potato Alkaloid Demissidine from the Common Sapogenin Tigogenin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;step synthesis of demissidine from tigogenin acetate was developed. The key&#8208;step of the synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate.







Abstract
A simple synthesis method of solanidane alkaloids from common steroidal sapogenins was developed. Previously described multi&#8208;step transformations of tigogenin to demissidine (8&#8211;12&#8197;steps) were shortened to four steps only. The key&#8208;step of the present synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate. Different approaches to this reaction, i.&#8201;e., a classical one via enolate, and a chemoselective umpolung transformation, were thoroughly investigated. The epimerization step is unnecessary if the starting sapogenin has the same configuration at C25 as the target alkaloid because the configuration at C25 (either R or S) remains intact throughout the synthesis. Thus, the related solanidane alkaloids, 12&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;25&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine and 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine, were synthesized in the three&#8208;step procedure with retention of configuration at this stereogenic center from rockogenin (25R&#8208;5&#945;&#8208;sapogenin) or sarsasapogenin (25S&#8208;5&#946;&#8208;sapogenin), respectively.

A key to rhenium hydride chemistry: The preparation of crystalline [ReH3(PPh3)4] allows for the preparation of defined rhenium(III) polyhydrido complexes through ligand exchange procedures with more basic phosphines. Azavinylidene complexes of the type [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] are the final products of reactions with nitriles. Potential proton or hydride donors react with [ReH3(PPh3)4] in toluene to give the pentahydride [ReH5(PPh3)3].







Abstract
The chemistry of the rhenium trihydrido complex [ReH3(PPh3)4] (1) has been reinvestigated. An improved synthesis and the solid&#8208;state structure of the compound as well as several reactions are reported. The solid&#8208;state structure of 1 is similar to that of [TcH3(PPh3)4] having a capped&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere. The PPh3 ligands surround the Re atom in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal mode with a short apical Re&#8722;P bond (2.300(2)&#8197;&#197;) and three longer basal bonds (2.429(2)&#8211;2.449(2)&#8197;&#197;). Reactions of 1 with monodentate phosphines such as PMe3 or PBu3 give the mono&#8208;substituted complexes [ReH3(PPh3)3(PMe3)] (2) and [ReH3(PPh3)3(PBu3)] (3) under retention of the apical PPh3 ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh3 ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh3&gt;PMe3&gt;PBu3. Treatment of [ReH3(PPh3)4] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH4(NCCH3)(PPh3)3]+ (4), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] (5). They are formed by an insertion of the nitrile into a Re&#8722;H bond. The solid&#8208;state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)CH3)] (5&#8201;a) was determined showing a linear Re&#8722;N&#8722;C unit with rhenium&#8722;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8722;carbon double bonds, while the N=CH&#8722;C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;. Two previously unknown polymorphs of [ReH5(PPh3)3] were isolated from reactions of 1 with HOC6H3(CH3)2 and thiourea after prolonged heating in toluene and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Electrochemical and Structural Characterization of Soft Landed Tungsten&#8208;Substituted Lindqvist Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxides</title>

         <dc:description>
Ion soft&#8208;landing enables accurate characterization of compound features using high&#8208;quality separation power. Using a quadrupole mass filter, ions are mass&#8208;selected and deposited onto a surface maintaining structural integrity. Doped and undoped polyoxovandates synthesized using solvothermal conditions are accurately characterized using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry.







Abstract
Lindqvist polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten&#8208;substituted POV&#8208;alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms. Soft landing of mass&#8208;selected ions was used to purify heterometal POV&#8208;alkoxides that cannot be readily separated using conventional approaches. The soft landed POV&#8208;alkoxides are characterized using infrared reflection&#8208;absorption spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The redox properties of the isolated ions are examined using an in&#8197;situ electrochemical cell which enables traditional in vacuo electrochemical measurements inside of an ion soft landing instrument. Although the overall cluster core retains redox activity after tungsten doping, vanadium&#8208;based redox couples (VV/VIV) are shifted substantially, indicating a pronounced effect of a heteroatom on the electronic structure of the core.

         <title>An Innovative Bi12SiO20 Multistage Cubic Nanospheres Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Bi//Zn Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 architecture is prepared by a simple calcination method and used as a cathode for high&#8208;performance Bi//Zn battery. The battery fabricated by the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20 cathode and Zn foil anode shows superior energy density (247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling durability (100&#8201;% capacity retention after 5000 cycles).







Abstract
Alkaline Bi//Zn batteries with superb safety, low cost, and high power density are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. However, their developments are severely limited by the Bi&#8208;based cathode as the unsatisfying capacity and cycle life. Herein, an innovative multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 (MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20) is successfully synthesized by a simple calcination method, which shows excellent energy storage performances of superior specific capacity (294&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate capability (134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 12&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). When coupled with Zn anode a superior MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 375&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Additionally, the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn battery shows excellent cycle life, which reserves more than 100&#8201;% of its original capacity after 5000 cycles. Such performance is higher than previously reported Bi//Zn battery and most other Zn batteries. This is the first example of using Bi12SiO20 as cathode for RAZBs, which may provide highly promising material towards better Bi//Zn battery.

         <title>Green Synthesis and Analytical Characterization of Core&#8208;Shell Copper Sub&#8208;Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green procedure for the preparation of Cu particles is here described, exploiting the stabilizing efficacy of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to obtain Cu@PVP core&#8208;shell particles. A simple washing and immobilization protocol allows modifying a polymer matrix without altering its physicochemical properties. Composite thin films show a controlled ionic release with promising antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
This study demonstrates a simple and reproducible approach to synthesize green core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles stabilized by poly(n&#8208;vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Cu@PVP colloids were here prepared using copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor and glucose as reducing agent. The presence of PVP in the synthetic medium eliminates the need for an inert atmosphere during the process, thus simplifying the whole method. Both the morphology and the spectroscopic properties of Cu@PVP colloids were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and infrared, UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Size distributions and average shell thickness were obtained by statistical analysis on TEM micrographs, and spectroscopies demonstrated the formation of a PVP layer around the copper core. The produced colloids were employed in composite thin films for potential antimicrobial application, in association with a highly&#8208;recyclable polymer: polycarbonate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;(1&#8208;methylethylidene)bis(phenol)).

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates a simple and reproducible approach to synthesize green core-shell copper sub-microparticles stabilized by poly(n-vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Cu@PVP colloids were here prepared using copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor and glucose as reducing agent. The presence of PVP in the synthetic medium eliminates the need for an inert atmosphere during the process, thus simplifying the whole method. Both the morphology and the spectroscopic properties of Cu@PVP colloids were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and infrared, UV-Vis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Size distributions and average shell thickness were obtained by statistical analysis on TEM micrographs, and spectroscopies demonstrated the formation of a PVP layer around the copper core. The produced colloids were employed in composite thin films for potential antimicrobial application, in association with a highly-recyclable polymer: polycarbonate (4,4&#8217;-(1-methylethylidene)bis(phenol)).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid&#8208;State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transport in a series of thymine&#8208;thymine mismatched DNA hairpins is fine&#8208;tuned. Surprisingly, the solid&#8208;state charge transport enhancement exhibits a semi&#8208;quantitative linear relationship with the integrity changes of DNA base pair stacking, which is modulated by the Hg ion chelation and DNA sequence. Such a deep mechanistic understanding will guide the design of future DNA&#8208;based electronics and bio/chemical sensors.







Abstract
Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid&#8208;state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill&#8208;defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive&#8208;linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid&#8208;state current&#8208;voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion&#8208;induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B&#8208;form.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrous Oxide by Light Alcohols Catalysed by a Low&#8208;Valent Ruthenium Diazadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low valent diruthenium dihydride complex catalyses the reduction of nitrous oxide with primary alcohols or hydrogen. Light alcohols (methanol, ethanol) or benzylic alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O.The reaction proceeds under mild conditions achieving TON of up to 480 and TOF of 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Decomposition of the environmentally harmful gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is usually performed thermally or catalytically. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is currently the most promising technology for N2O mitigation, a multicomponent heterogeneous catalytic system that employs reducing agents such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or a combination thereof. This study reports the first homogenous catalyst that performs the reduction of nitrous oxide employing readily available and cheap light alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol derivatives. During the reaction, these alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O, later entering the reaction as substrate. The reaction is catalysed by the low&#8208;valent dinuclear ruthenium complex [Ru2H(&#956;&#8208;H)(Me2dad)(dbcot)2] that carries a diazabutadiene, Me2dad, and two rigid dienes, dbcot, as ligands. The reduction of nitrous oxide proceeds with low catalyst loadings under relatively mild conditions (65&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, 1.4&#8197;bar N2O) achieving turnover numbers of up to 480 and turnover frequencies of up to 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Gold Teflates Revisited: From the Lewis Superacid [Au(OTeF5)3] to the Anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route to the gold(III) pentafluoroorthotellurates [Au(OTeF5)3] and [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; based on commercially available gold chlorides is presented. The former was classified as a Lewis superacid, with an enhanced Lewis acidity yet better manageability compared to AuF3, underlining the potential of the &#8722;OTeF5 group to also stabilize highly reactive transition&#8208;metal compounds.







Abstract
A new synthetic access to the Lewis acid [Au(OTeF5)3] and the preparation of the related, unprecedented anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; with inorganic or organic cations starting from commercially available and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle gold chlorides are presented. In this first extensive study of the Lewis acidity of a transition&#8208;metal teflate complex by using different experimental and quantum chemical methods, [Au(OTeF5)3] was classified as a Lewis superacid. The solid&#8208;state structure of the triphenylphosphine oxide adduct [Au(OPPh3)(OTeF5)3] was determined, representing the first structural characterization of an adduct of this highly reactive [Au(OTeF5)3]. Therein, the coordination environment around the gold center slightly deviates from the typical square planar geometry. The [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; anion shows a similar coordination motif.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis</title>

A fast and efficient catalyst&#8208;free thia&#8208;Michael addition onto &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylacrylates is thoroughly studied through experimental kinetic studies and DFT calculations in order to elucidate its mechanism. An application to a swift preparation of a thermoset is also reported.Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to alpha&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis (Leclerc, Poli, et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Thia&#8208;Michael additions (1,4&#8208;additions of a thiol to a Michael acceptor) are generally catalyzed by an external Br&#248;nsted or Lewis base. A spontaneous (uncatalyzed) Michael addition of thiols to &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acrylates is described, as well as its application to the very efficient preparation of a thermoset. A thorough mechanistic investigation, based on an experimental kinetic study and on DFT calculations, is presented for the addition of arene&#8208; and alkanethiols to tert&#8208;butyl trifluoromethyl acrylate in polar aprotic solvents, unveiling a probable solvent&#8208;assisted proton transfer in the rate&#8208;determining step and a considerable lowering of the energy barrier induced by the CF3 group.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity Switch During Alkene Reductions: Diastereodivergent Syntheses of Molecular Fossils via MHAT or Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>

Using a diastereoselective and robust strategy we prepared a set of 16 molecular fossils (MF) and confirmed the presence of 6 of them in a 120&#8208;million&#8208;year&#8208;old geological sample. Unlike structural fossils, MF came from soft tissues, and during their (dia)catagenesis they suffer framework and stereochemical modifications exposing their geological history. Such changes and concentration differences helped us to prove an ancient oil migration event.







Abstract
Sixteen geosterane derivatives were synthesized in up to 57&#8201;% overall yields in four steps harnessing the olefin cross&#8208;metathesis (OCM) and Metal hydride H atom transfer (MHAT) or homogeneous hydrogenation reactions as key steps. Drawing on this strategy, the diastereomeric ratio (d.&#8201;r.) reached up to 24&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the thermodynamic isomer and 7&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the other isomer in the hydrogenation step. In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2&#8208;(3&#945;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan) acetate, methyl 2&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate, and methyl 6&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)hexanoate, as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120&#8197;million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those carboxylic acids derived from forerunner geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.

         <title>Piezoelectric Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mediated Mechanoredox Borylation and Arylation Reactions by Ball Milling</title>

Upon mechanical agitation, piezoelectric metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to promote mechanoredox reactions, enabling both borylation and arylation reactions between aryl diazonium salts and bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes with high efficiencies.







Abstract
Herein, metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were synthesized, and their piezoelectric properties were characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy. Under mechanical agitation, the highly polarized UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to reduce aryl diazonium salts, forming the aryl radical species, which further react with bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes to generate the desired products with broad substrate scope. For all substrates, it was found that the reactions mediated by UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which exhibited better piezoelectric property, were more efficient than those promoted by UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, it was shown that the convenient regeneration of spent catalysts can be reused for promoting mechanoredox reactions without loss of activities by taking advantage of the unmatched repairability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical pathway was involved in these transformations.

Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives with cyclic ketimines attached to a neutral functional group is reported. This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities. Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the 5&#8208;aminopyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones was performed, with no decrease in the yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Tuning Directed Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Conversion of Pyrrole&#8208;Based Styryl Coumarin Dual&#8208;Color Photoconverters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning photoconverter: We have studied the effects of N&#8208;substitution of styryl coumarin pyrrole dyes on their photophysical and photoconversion properties. This study led to an improved version of a dual&#8208;emission photoconverter based on the directed photooxidation&#8208;induced conversion mechanism, which was successfully used in bioimaging with sequential photoconversion of single cells.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;emissive photoconvertible fluorophores (DPCFs) are powerful tools to unambiguously track labeled cells in bioimaging. We recently introduced a new rational mechanism called directed photooxidation&#8208;induced conversion (DPIC) enabling efficient DPCFs to be obtained by conjugating a coumarin to aromatic singlet&#8208;oxygen reactive moieties (ASORMs). Pyrrole was found to be a suitable ASORM as it provided a high hypsochromic shift along with a fast and efficient conversion. By synthesizing various pyrrole&#8208;based styryl coumarin dyes, we showed that the photoconversion properties, including the quantum yield of photoconversion and the chemical yield of conversion can be tuned by chemical modification of the pyrrole. These modifications led to an improved dual emissive converter, SCP&#8722;Boc, which displayed a high brightness and an enhanced photoconversion yield of 63&#8201;%. SCP&#8722;Boc was successfully used to sequentially photoconvert cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

         <title>Development of Potent and Highly Selective Epoxyketone&#8208;Based Plasmodium Proteasome Inhibitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Development of epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. The best inhibitor irreversibly inactivates the &#946;5 subunit of the P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome and contains a hexanoyl group at P4, a D&#8208;amino acid at P3 and a fluorinated aromatic L&#8208;amino acid at P1. This compound represents a novel, potent and selective antimalarial drug lead.







Abstract
Here, we present remarkable epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000&#8208;fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic&#8208;stage P.&#8197;falciparum over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D&#8208;amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from P.&#8197;falciparum cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171&#8208;fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a P. berghei mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6&#8197;days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti&#8208;malarial drugs.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we present remarkable epoxyketone-based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood-stage &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000-fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic-stage &lt;i&gt;P.&#8197;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D-amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from &lt;i&gt;P.&#8197;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171-fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of &lt;i&gt;P.&#8197;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a &lt;i&gt;P. berghei&lt;/i&gt; mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6&#8197;days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti-malarial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Prominence of Facilitator&#160;&#960;&#8208;Holes: The Classic N&#8592;N Pnictogen Bonding in Nitrobenzene&#8208;Ammonia Dimer with its Structural Elucidation and Experimental Characterization at Low Temperatures</title>

A direct correlation between the magnitude of potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen in &#8208;NO2 moiety and the strength of the pnictogen bond hosted by nitrogen is obtained by infrared spectroscopy of matrix isolated heterodimers of nitromethane and nitrobenzene with ammonia. The pivotal role of &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen as a facilitator of pnictogen bonds is demonstrated.







Abstract
The nitrogen of nitro group is a paradigmatic pnictogen due the presence of a&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole and a number of studies have been performed recently on prototypical nitromethane (NM). Homodimers and heterodimers of NM are sustained by&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bonds hosted by nitrogen. To understand the effect of substitution on this &#960;&#8208;hole and thus the pnictogen bond, heterodimers of nitrobenzene (NB; phenyl substitution in place of methyl) with ammonia (AM) have been probed, as a test case, using matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and&#160;ab initio&#160;computations. Of the four structures optimized on the potential energy surface the energetically dominant global minimum, stabilized by &#960;&#8208;hole driven O=N&#8592;N pnictogen bonding with co&#8208;operative N&#8722;H&#8592;O hydrogen bonding, was experimentally identified at low temperatures. A comparison of the pnictogen bonding of NB&#8208;AM dimers with NM counterpart (NM&#8208;AM dimers) divulged the dominance of electrostatic origin of pnictogen bonding in both the class of dimers. The reduced strength of pnictogen bonding in NB&#8208;AM dimers in comparison to NM&#8208;AM dimers was discerned, which has been established to be a consequence of the reduced electrostatic potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole of NB relative to that in NM. The strength of&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bond was directly correlated with the binding energy and the infrared shifts in the signature vibrational bands of the NB, NM and AM submolecules due to dimerization under matrix isolated conditions at low temperatures.

         <title>A Widely Applicable and Versatile Method for the Ring&#8208;Opening 1,3&#8208;Carbocarbonation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>

1,3&#8208;Carbocarbonation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) was achieved by employing Grignard reagents under copper catalysis, followed by the addition of carbon electrophiles. This method allowed the installation of both saturated and unsaturated carbon residues at both the electrophilic and nucleophilic sites.







Abstract
A 1,3&#8208;carbocarbonation of 2&#8208;substituted cyclopropane 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates introduces various saturated or unsaturated carbon residues at the 1&#8208; and 3&#8208; position of the former three&#8208;membered ring. Under copper catalysis, ring&#8208;opening attack with a Grignard reagent proceeded smoothly; the intermediate was converted to the final product by reaction with appropriate carbon&#8208;based electrophiles under basic conditions. As nucleophiles, Grignard reagents derived from sp3&#8208;, sp2&#8208;, and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon residues were successfully employed, whereas various aliphatic bromides and EBX derivatives (for sp moieties) served as electrophiles.

With the increase of x, the liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x changed from lamellar structure to columnar structure. The polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric effect, with 25&#8197;mA current under UV irradiation.







Abstract
A series of side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymers P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x, where x is the molar ratio of cyanostilbene (CN&#8208;DBE) to poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) repeating unit, was synthesized based on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between P4VP and CN&#8208;DBE. Their luminescent property, liquid crystalline structure and photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property were elucidated using photoluminescence spectra, X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal imaging and thermoelectric experiments. With the increase of x, the supramolecular system can be changed from lamellar structure to hexagonal columnar structure. Moreover, the P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)x polymer with columnar structure exhibits more efficient photothermal effect. The temperature of P4VP(CN&#8208;DBE)0.6 can rise to 130&#8201;&#176;C within 10&#8197;s under the irradiation of ultraviolet lamp. In addition, the supramolecular system possesses unique photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric conversion ability, and 25&#8197;mA current can be detected in the circuit coupled with the thermoelectric module. This work broadens the potential applications of hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer, and provides a simple and facile strategy to prepare liquid crystalline polymers with photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;electric property.

The reduction of {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5&#8197;equivalents of KC8 generates the cyclic tetra&#8208;tin tetra&#8208;boryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion. This system is non&#8208;aromatic as determined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift Calculations, with the principal resonance structures shown to involve a Sn=Sn double bond and 1,2&#8208;localized negative charges.







Abstract
The reduction of the boryl&#8208;substituted SnII bromide {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5&#8197;equivalents of potassium graphite leads to the generation of the cyclic tetratin tetraboryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion. This system is non&#8208;aromatic as determined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift Calculations (NICS(0)=&#8722;0.28, NICS(1)=&#8722;3.17), with the primary contributing resonance structures shown by Natural Resonance Theory (NRT) to involve a Sn=Sn double bond and 1,2&#8208;localized negative charges. Abstraction of the K+ cations or oxidation leads to contraction or cleavage of the Sn4 unit, respectively, while protonation generates the neutral dihydride 1,2&#8208;Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4H2 (a heavier homologue of cyclobutene) in a manner consistent with the predicted charge distribution in the [Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4]2&#8722; dianion.

Abstraction of the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations or oxidation leads to contraction or cleavage of the Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; unit, respectively, while protonation generates the neutral dihydride 1,2-Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{B(NDippCH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a heavier homologue of cyclobutene) in a manner consistent with the predicted charge distribution in the [Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{B(NDippCH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Aluminium Imide as a Transfer Agent for the [NR]2&#8722; Function via Metathesis Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with oxygen&#8208;containing substrates are probed with a view to developing its use as a transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8722; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] fragments to give organo&#8208;azide, &#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;imine products, driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The reactions of a terminal aluminium imide with a range of oxygen&#8208;containing substrates have been probed with a view to developing its use as a novel main group transfer agent for the [NR]2&#8722; fragment. We demonstrate transfer of the imide moiety to [N2], [CO] and [Ph(H)C] units driven thermodynamically by Al&#8722;O bond formation. N2O reacts rapidly to generate the organoazide DippN3 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), while CO2 (under dilute reaction conditions) yields the corresponding isocyanate, DippNCO. Mechanistic studies, using both experimental and quantum chemical techniques, identify a carbamate complex K2[(NON)Al&#8208;{&#954;2&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;N(Dipp)CO2}]2 (formed via [2+2] cycloaddition) as an intermediate in the formation of DippNCO, and also in an alternative reaction leading to the generation of the amino&#8722;dicarboxylate complex K2[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8722;(O,O&#8242;)&#8722;(O2C)2N&#8208;(Dipp)}] (via the take&#8208;up of a second equivalent of CO2). In the case of benzaldehyde, a similar [2+2] cycloaddition process generates the metallacyclic hemi&#8208;aminal complex, Kn[(NON)Al{&#954;2&#8722;(N,O)&#8722;(N(Dipp)C(Ph)(H)O}]n. Extrusion of the imine, PhC(H)NDipp, via cyclo&#8208;reversion is disfavoured thermally, due to the high energy of the putative aluminium oxide co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(O)]2. However, addition of CO2 allows the imine to be released, driven by the formation of the thermodynamically more stable aluminium carbonate co&#8208;product, K2[(NON)Al(&#954;2&#8722;(O,O&#8242;)&#8722;CO3)]2.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Ir(III) dihydride complex catalyzed 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols was realized, affording the corresponding less easily accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively in high yields from readily available starting materials. The reaction pathway involves a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and the dihydride in Ir(III) dihydride complex acts as the hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of iridium center.







Abstract
The allylic alcohol structural motif is prevalent in many important molecules and valuable building blocks. The rearrangement reaction is one of the most important transformations, however there are only a few reports for the 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols. Herein, a 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of allylic alcohols catalyzed by an Ir(III) dihydride complex is described. This reaction could provide the corresponding less accessible allylic alcohols regio&#8208; and stereoselectively from readily available E/Z mixtures of the substrates. Furthermore, a tandem alkene isomerization followed by 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of homoallylic alcohols was also realized. In addition, this rearrangement reaction could be used to synthesize the natural product Navenone B. Mechanistic investigation indicated that the reaction pathway involved a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ir(V) intermediate and that the dihydride in the iridium catalyst acts as a hydrogen switch to modulate the valence of the iridium center.

         <title>Balancing Attraction and Repulsion: The Influence of London Dispersion in [10]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Fullerene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular assembly between substituted [10]cycloparaphenylene (s[10]CPP) and fullerenes was studied to investigate the subtle interplay of steric repulsion, conformation and attractive London dispersion interactions. For this, [10]CPP and a tert&#8208;butyl ester&#8208;substituted analogue were employed as host molecules whose fluorescence is quenched upon addition of C60 as well as alkyl malonyl ester&#8208;substituted fullerenes.







Abstract
Herein we present a systematic study of the influence of different alkyl chains in malonyl ester fullerene adducts with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP]) and a tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) ester&#8208;substituted [10]CPP analogue. The association constants between the nanoring hosts and the fullerene guests were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments. The trends in association were rationalized by an interplay of repulsion arising from an extended volume and London dispersion as an attractive counterpart.

Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to reactions that can proceed in biological systems without interfering with biological processes. It has enabled the study of biomolecules in their native environment and has facilitated advanced imaging and diagnostic applications. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203942), M.&#8197;M.&#8197;A. Mitry, F. Greco and H.&#8197;M.&#8197;I. Osborn critically appraise the suitability of bioorthogonal reactions for in vivo applications. Areas of focus are chemical reactions and the targeting mechanisms used to deliver the bioorthogonal reactions&#8217; components.

Molecular interactions are a combination of different attractive and repulsive forces. We have studied the delicate balance within a supramolecular [10]cycloparaphenylene&#8211;fullerene complex&#8212;both functionalized with alkyl esters&#8212;to evaluate the attractive and repulsive interplay between the substituents on the components. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A. Wegner and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300268).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 can be converted into hydrocarbon fuel through renewable electricity. This review introduces three strategies that can effectively combine CO2 reduction with organic conversion. Through the selection of substrates and the design of catalysts, the construction of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;N bonds can be precisely controlled, which can expand the product range and use renewable power more effectively.

Coupling CO2 reduction and organic conversion can create a win&#8208;win situation, and this can not only obtain high&#8208;value chemicals with high selectivity, but also reduce reaction overpotential and improve energy efficiency. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of different coupling systems, and propose opinions for further development of this direction.







Abstract
The electrochemical process of coupling electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and organic conversion reaction can effectively reduce the reaction overpotential and obtain value&#8208;added chemicals. Moreover, because of the diversity of substrates and the designability of coupling forms, more and more attention has been paid to this field. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of coupling electrolysis in recent years, (1) co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and organics at the cathode to obtain specific products with high selectivity, (2) replacing traditional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other valuable oxidation reactions to improve energy utilization efficiency and economic benefits of CO2 conversion, (3) in an electrolytic cell without membrane, the cathode and anode jointly transform CO2 and organics to redox products. We hope that the examples and insights on coupling electrolysis introduced in this review can inspire researchers to further explore and innovate in this direction.

         <title>In Vivo Applications of Bioorthogonal Reactions: Chemistry and Targeting Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry in the in vivo settings. In this review, we discuss the latest trends in the in vivo applications of bioorthogonal reactions. The advances in bioorthogonal reactions that are considered for in&#8197;vivo applications, and the targeting methods used to deliver the biorthogonal components to the desired site of action, are discussed along with the pretargeting approach for radiolabelling.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry involves selective biocompatible reactions between functional groups that are not normally present in biology. It has been used to probe biomolecules in living systems, and has advanced biomedical strategies such as diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, the challenges and opportunities encountered when translating in vitro bioorthogonal approaches to in vivo settings are presented, with a focus on methods to deliver the bioorthogonal reaction components. These methods include&#8197;metabolic bioengineering, active targeting, passive targeting, and simultaneously used strategies. The suitability of bioorthogonal ligation reactions and bond cleavage reactions for in vivo applications is critically appraised, and practical considerations such as the optimum scheduling regimen in pretargeting approaches are discussed. Finally, we present our own perspectives for this area and identify what, in our view, are the key challenges that must be overcome to maximise the impact of these approaches.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free Engineering toward Efficient Zinc Storage: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 20, April 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free engineering strategies in each assembly components are summarized to homogenize Zn2+ diffusion and electric field at the Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based energy storage has lately gained popularity due to natural abundance, operational safety, high energy density. Unfortunately, dendrite growth is a common and intractable issue faced in existing zinc&#8208;ion batteries to shorten cycle lifespan/stability. This review summarizes recent progress in assembly component (e.&#8201;g., anode, electrolyte, separator) engineering for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;ion batteries. First, diversiform strategies of Zn surface modification and Zn host design are presented to shield the fundamental adverse effect aroused by uneven zinc deposition on the anode. Then, subtle deployments of electrolyte constituents are illustrated to optimize the Zn2+ solvation structure for ultimate dendrite control and Coulombic efficiency elevation in aqueous systems and beyond (e.&#8201;g., eutectic electrolytes). Furthermore, rational manipulation of advanced separators and the upgrade of zinc metal&#8208;free Zn2+&#8208;storage devices are briefly discussed to explore the dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;storage. Finally, challenges and perspectives are proposed to offer research inspirations toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.

         <title>CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures: importance of dual binding site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 adsorption and activation on Cu single atom catalysts and Cu nanoclusters supported on the (110) surface of rutile and on the (101) surface of anatase TiO2 has been investigated by means of first principles electronic structure calculations. The role of oxide reduction associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies has been considered. Five main messages emerge from this study. (1) CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures is surface sensitive, as the rutile and anatase surfaces can exhibit different behaviours; (2) the surface morphology is essential since CO2 is activated only when the molecule can simultaneously bind to at least two active sites, such as a Cu atom on one side and an oxide ion on the other site; (3) Cu atoms on TiO2 are in +I oxidation state and can bind and activate CO2 via charge transfer from the oxide; (4) on supported Cu clusters CO2 activation occurs mostly at the metal/oxide interface; (5) the presence of O vacancy sites facilitates the spontaneous dissociation of CO2 to CO, or increases the electron density of the metal catalyst, two effects that can influence the mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol or other chemicals.</dc:description>

Functionalisation of the backbone of the ligands leads to distinct crystal packing motifs between the three cages, as observed with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Enantioselective Sequential Catalytic Arylation&#8211;Fukuyama Cross&#8208;coupling of 1,1&#8208;Biszincioalkane Linchpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,1&#8208;Bis(iodozincio)alkanes are used as dinucleophilic linchpins in an enantioselective double cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence involving aryl iodides and then thioesters. The two catalytic C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming reactions are achieved in the same pot through two distinct palladium&#8208;based catalytic systems: a first non&#8208;enantioselective one delivering configurationally labile secondary benzylzinc species from an achiral precursor, and a second enantioconvergent one that operates a highly efficient dynamic kinetic resolution of the racemic intermediates. This strategy, new in the area of asymmetric synthesis through two consecutive electrophilic substitution reactions of geminated C(sp3)&#8208;organodimetallics, provides useful methodology to access in a modular fashion acyclic a&#8208;disubstituted ketone products with very high enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8208;H Arylation of Dithiophene&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene: Tuneable Electronic Properties and 2D Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Networks at the Solid/Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiafulvalene is among the most well&#8208;known building blocks in molecular electronics due to its outstanding electron&#8208;donating and redox properties. Among its derivatives, dithiophene&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (DT&#8208;TTF) has attracted considerable interest in organic electronics, owing to its high field&#8208;effect mobility. Herein, we report the direct C&#8208;H arylation of DT&#8208;TTF to synthesise mono&#8208; and tetraarylated derivatives functionalised with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups in order to evaluate their influence on the electronic properties by cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Self&#8208;assembly of the DT&#8208;TTF&#8208;tetrabenzoic acid derivative was studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) which revealed the formation of ordered, densely packed 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks at the graphite/liquid interface. The tetrabenzoic acid derivative can attain a planar geometry on the graphite surface due to van der Waals interactions with the surface and H&#8208;bonding with neighbouring molecules. This study demonstrates a simple method for the synthesis of arylated DT&#8208;TTF derivatives for the construction of novel p&#8208;extended electroactive frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the reactivity of diazaborinines towards the activation of &#963;&#8208;bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poorly understood factors governing the small molecule activation reactions mediated by diazaborinines have been computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the activation of E&#8208;H &#963;&#8208;bonds (E = H, C, Si, N, P, O, S) has been investigated. These reactions, which proceed in a concerted manner, are exergonic and, in general, associated with relatively low activation barriers.In addition, the barrier becomes lower for the E&#8208;H bonds involving the heavier element in the same group (&#916;G&#8800;: C&gt;Si; N&gt;P; O&gt;S). This reactivity trend together with the mode of action of the diazaborinine system are quantitatively analyzed by means of the activation strain model of reactivity in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Helically folded oligoamides of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid composed of up to 41 units were prepared using optimized manual solid phase synthesis (SPS).

         <title>The Role of Anionic Ligands on Photoreactivity in Mo(VI) Dioxo Complexes of the Form MoO2X2(NN)
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study into the light&#8208;initiated C&#8722;H activation reactivity by MoO2X2(bpy) elucidates the critical role of a bpy&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. With stronger donating anionic ancillary ligands, the first excited state involves a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer from the anionic ancillary ligand (X), which initiated radical decomposition instead of C&#8722;H activation via the metal oxo motif.







Abstract
The photoreactivity of d0 metal dioxo complexes in activating C&#8722;H bonds has been recently studied.[1&#8211;3] We have previously reported that MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) is an effective platform for light initiated C&#8722;H activation with unique product selectivity for the overall functionalization.[1] Herein we expand on these studies and report the synthesis and photoreactivity of several new Mo(VI) dioxo complexes with the general formula MoO2(X)2(NN); where X=F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, CH3&#8722;, PhO&#8722;, tBuO&#8722; and NN=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;bipyridine (bpy&#8208;tBu). Among these compounds, MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208;tBu) and MoO2Br2(bpy&#8208;tBu) are able to participate in bimolecular photoreactivity with several substrates containing C&#8722;H bonds of various types such as allyls, benzyls, aldehydes (RCHO) and alkanes. MoO2(CH3)2bpy and MoO2(PhO)2bpy do not participate in bimolecular photoreactions and instead they undergo photodecompositions. Computational studies indicate that the nature of the HOMO and LUMO is critical in supporting photoreactivity, with access to an LMCT (bpy&#8594;Mo) being necessary for tractable hydrocarbon functionalization.

         <title>Reactivity of Silylene with Gallium&#8208; and Boron Trihalide at Reductive Conditions Resulting in Unforeseen Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galliumhalosilanes: Synthesis of a first compound comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms. Where one gallium presents between two silylene and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. The oxidation state of the gallium and silicon atoms remains the same even after the reduction. Further reaction of silylene with boron halide leads to the formation of silylene&#8208;boron adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot reaction of gallium and boron halides with potassium graphite in the presence of benzamidinate stabilized silylene LSi&#8208;R, (L=PhC(NtBu)2). The reaction of LSiCl with an equivalent amount of GaI3 in the presence of KC8 leads to the direct substitution of one chloride group by gallium diiodide simultaneously additional coordination of silylene resulted in L(Cl)Si&#8594;GaI2&#8208;Si(L)&#8594;GaI3 (1). In compound 1, the structure comprises two differently coordinated gallium atoms where one gallium presents between two silylenes and the other gallium is only coordinated by one silylene. In this Lewis acid&#8208;base reaction the oxidation states of the starting materials remain unchanged. The same is valid in the silylene boron adduct formation of L(tBu)Si&#8208;BPhCl2 (2) and L(tBu)Si&#8208;BBr3 (3). This new route provides access to galliumhalosilanes challenging to synthesize by any other method.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Decorated Nonaromatic Amine Emitters Towards Efficient Triplet Exciton Utilization in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possessed powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, sulfur atom is particularly attractive for boosting triplet exciton utilization in electroluminescence. Here, the sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine compounds served as thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emitters for highly efficient OLED applications are highlighted.







Abstract
Purely organic compounds served as promising materials for organic electronics have intrigued extensive research focuses owing to their unique photophysical and electronic properties. In the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the utilization of triplet excitons is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance devices. In contrast to the traditional aromatic amine&#8208;based counterparts, sulfur atom with a high&#8208;level outer orbit simultaneously provides powerful electron&#8208;donating ability and striking spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect to facilitate the utilization of theoretically spin&#8208;forbidden triplet excitons, demonstrating great prospect in constructing highly emissive purely organic emitters for OLED applications. Herein, we summarize the currently developed sulfur&#8208;decorated nonaromatic amine&#8208;based emitters exhibiting attractive photoelectronic characteristics, and gain insight into the understanding of molecular design and photophysical processes of these emitters, providing new perspectives for enriching the existing luminescent material systems and designing high&#8208;performance emitters.

         <title>Metal Complex Molecular Junctions as Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular junctions, which are composed of metal electrode&#8208;molecule&#8208;metal electrode structures, are attractive components of thermoelectric devices. In this Concept article, we discuss recent thermoelectric studies on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential utility of functional metal complex junctions for thermoelectric devices is also described.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule junctions and self&#8208;assembled monolayer junctions are attractive architectures for thermoelectric devices. However, given the poor thermoelectric performance of organic molecules investigated so far, molecules characterized by high conductance and Seebeck coefficient values are desired to be explored. Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8208;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.

         <title>Significant Control on Zero&#8208;Field Quantum Tunneling of Magnetization in Dysprosium Based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets via Orientation of the Anilato Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bridging ligand orientation in a dinuclear Dy(III) complex provides different coordination geometry. The geometry with higher axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) around DyIII centre gives higher energy barrier (Ueff) than the low order symmetric geometry [triangular dodecahedron geometry (pseudo D2d)] due to the large difference in their transverse anisotropy.







Abstract
Tuning the bridging fashion of anilato ligand in dinuclear DyIII complexes, reveals a sizable effect on the slow relaxation of magnetization. Combined experimental and theoretical studies divulge that the geometry with high order axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) reduces the transverse crystal fields corresponding to QTM (quantum tunneling of magnetization) resulting in a significant increase in energy barrier (Ueff=518&#8197;cm&#8722;1) through the Orbach relaxation process whereas the geometry with lower symmetry (triangular dodecahedron, pseudo D2d) enhances the transverse crystal fields that accelerate the ground state QTM process. Notably, the value 518&#8197;cm&#8722;1 represents the highest energy barrier among anilato ligand based SMMs.

         <title>Differently N&#8208;Capped Analogues of Fmoc&#8208;FF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues were collected and analyzed in their morphological, mechanical, and functional features, highlighting the effects caused by the Fmoc&#8208; modification.







Abstract
Short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been recently envisioned as excellent building blocks for the formulation of hydrogels with appealing properties. Due to its simplicity and capability to gel under physiological conditions, Fmoc&#8208;FF (N&#945;&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;diphenylalanine), remains one of the most studied low molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators. Since its first identification in 2006, a plethora of its analogues were synthetized and investigated for the fabrication of novel supramolecular materials. Here we report a description of the Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues in which the aromatic Fmoc group is replaced with other substituents. These analogues are distinguished into five different classes including derivatives: i) customized with solid phase peptide synthesis protecting groups; ii) containing non&#8208;aromatic groups, iii) containing aromatic groups, iv) derivatized with metal complexes and v) containing stimuli&#8208;responsive groups. The morphological, mechanical, and functional effects caused by this modification on the resulting material are also pointed out.

         <title>Sparkling Organic Phosphorescence from Fluorinated Tetrathia[7]helicenes: Synthesis and Photophysical, Electrochemical and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putting a green spin on [7]TH: Fluorination of the tetrathia[7]helicene backbone disclosed important functionalization&#8208;related structure&#8208;electronic alterations crucial in the design of novel chiral derivatives. [7]THs also show brilliant green phosphorescence resulting from enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) due to an S&#8208;atom effect and distortion annulation.







Abstract
Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial beacuse most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine&#8208;containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes, highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared in high yields through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550&#8197;nm, and the studies suggest an efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet nonplanar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements, while DFT calculations enable a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations to be defined.

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform mechanochemical method for the partial reduction of TiO2 and Nb2O5 to the corresponding black oxides using NaH and LiH as reducing agents was developed. As shown by EPR spectroscopy, unpaired electrons were generated, and the obtained oxides exhibit better photocatalytic activity than the pristine oxides.







Abstract
Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. This study reports the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ into the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.

         <title>A Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8722;H Olefination Strategy and Its Application Towards Global Proteome Profiling of &#916;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that empowers activity&#8208;based proteome profiling of &#916;8&#8208;THC, a psychoactive natural product from Cannabis sativa, through a late&#8208;stage arene olefination method is described. This olefination method is capable of converting non&#8208;covalent acting compounds, such as &#916;8&#8208;THC, into activity&#8208;based probes after silyl deprotection. Its ability to interrogate protein interaction landscape of &#916;8&#8208;THC is then compared with AfBPP.







Abstract
Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such reliance on innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture restricted its applications to covalent acting compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8722;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H olefination with an arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in&#8197;situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#916;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4&#8201;db, a &#916;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with AfBP 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#916;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8722;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the synthesis, characterization and basic physiochemical properties of two novel heteroatom&#8208;doped PAHs (BTF and BTT). The studies on their singlet fission (SF) show that the efficiency of BTT is higher than that of BTF by two times while the triplet generation time of BTT becomes slower compared with BTF, indicating that the introduction of sulfur atom has a significant influence on the SF process.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8211;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2&#8197;times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.

         <title>Polarity and Dielectric Property Control Triggered by a Coordinated Solvent Molecule Exchange in Luminescent Mononuclear Aluminium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of molecule&#8208;based multifunctional switchable materials, exhibiting a switch of polarity and dielectric property, are extremely limited. Herein, we demonstrated solvent&#8208;vapour&#8208;induced reversible molecular rearrangements between non&#8208;polar crystals [Al(sap)(acac)(sol)] (H2sap = 2&#8208;salicylideneaminophenol, acac = acetylacetonate, sol = MeOH (1), EtOH (2)) and polar crystal [Al(sap)(acac)(DMSO)] (3). This crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal structural transformation was accompanied by a switch of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric properties, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, reflecting the SHG&#8208;active polar Cc space group of 3. This is the first reported example of dielectric properties and polarity switching in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit the strong green emission in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Sidechain&#8208;Backbone Tetrel Bonding Interactions Provide a General Mechanism for trans&#8208;Peptoid Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amide bonds impedes de novo design of folded peptoids (poly&#8208;N&#8208;substituted glycines) with precise secondary structures and affects peptoid&#8208;biomolecule binding affinity. Herein, from X&#8208;ray, NMR and DFT studies of azapeptoids, we have discovered a tetrel bonding interaction that stabilizes trans&#8208;peptoids. We show that peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain adopt trans&#8208;amide geometries due to the presence of a nX/&#960;Ar &#8594; &#963;*C&#945;&#8210;N tetrel bonding interaction between the sidechain &#945;&#8208;heteroatom lone pair (nX) or &#960;&#8208;electrons (&#960;Ar) and the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8210;N bond. Further, CD spectroscopic studies of oligo&#8208;proline host&#8208;guest model peptides showed that azapeptoid residues stabilize polyproline II helical conformation. These data indicate that the sidechain&#8208;backbone tetrel bonding could be leveraged to design peptoids with precise secondary structures for a wide range of biological and material applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyst C70 was introduced for the facile construction of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines under mild conditions, yielding a diverse library of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Low catalyst loading, gram scale synthesis, and broad substrate scope (48 examples) demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol and encourage its future application as a photoredox catalyst in organic transformations.







Abstract
Herein, fullerene (C70) is introduced as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#934;&#9653;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical by energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism. The superoxide radical acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process. Azomethine ylide further participates in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Modifications of acyl carrier protein&#8208;bound glycosylated polyketides in pactamycin biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol&#8208;containing natural product produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum. Recent studies showed that the aminocyclopentitol unit is derived from N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine, which is attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound polyketide by a glycosyltransferase enzyme, PtmJ. Here, we report a series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications of the sugar moiety of the glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. In vitro reconstitution of PtmS (an AMP&#8208;ligase), PtmI (an ACP), PtmJ, PtmN (an oxidoreductase), PtmA (an aminotransferase), and PtmB (a putative carbamoyltransferase) showed that the N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine moiety of the glycosylated polyketide is first oxidized by PtmN and then transaminated by PtmA to give ACP&#8208;bound 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl polyketide. The amino group is then coupled with carbamoyl phosphate by PtmB to give a urea functionality. We also show that PtmG is a deacetylase that hydrolyses the C&#8208;2 N&#8208;acetyl group to give a free amine.</dc:description>

The products contain As2, As4 or As8 units and represent the first examples of CAACs&#8208;substituted products of yellow arsenic. The reactivity of As4 was compared with the reactivities of P4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, which led to a series of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives such as ([(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;P4)] (4) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8)] (7)) and the [(CAAC3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;AsP3)] (5).

         <title>Esterase specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Esterases enzymes regulate the body&#8217;s homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase's active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe,&#160;PM&#8208;OAc,&#160;to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH~ 8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Esterases enzymes regulate the body&#8217;s homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase's active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn-on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe,&#160;PM-OAc,&#160;to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH~ 8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD-DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM-OAc)&#160;binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image-based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Heterobiaryls through Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral heterobiaryls have wide applications in chiral ligands, catalysts, and bioactive compounds, which have aroused great interest in the chemistry community. This review provides a summary of the recent atroposelective synthesis strategies of heterobiaryls via ring&#8208;formation approaches involving transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which have aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic heterobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarize the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through ring formation approaches, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also discussed.

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin (FePEG5kTPP) formed an 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with a face&#8208;to&#8208;face cyclodextrin dimer in aqueous solution. The O2 adduct of the ferrous complex shows similar O2 binding affinity with natural hemoglobin and a long circulation time in blood, leading to the simple supramolecular complex that can be used as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur is described. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is much greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.

         <title>Fine Tuning of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts for the Synthesis of Tropane Alkaloid Skeletons
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell quantum dots proved to be efficient photocatalysts for a two steps [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons, whereas InP&#8208;ZnS quantum dots stopped after the first step, affording a clean allylation reaction.







Abstract
Several types of Quantum Dots (QDs) (CdS, CdSe and InP, as well as core&#8208;shell QDs such as type I InP&#8208;ZnS, quasi type&#8208;II CdSe&#8208;CdS and inverted type&#8208;I CdS&#8208;CdSe) were considered for generating &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl free radicals. The feasibility of the oxidation of the N&#8208;aryl amines and the generation of the desired radical was evidenced experimentally by quenching of the photoluminescence of the QDs and by testing a vinylation reaction using an alkenylsulfone radical trap. The QDs were tested in a radical [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons and that requires the completion of two consecutive catalytic cycles. Several QDs such as CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell proved to be efficient photocatalysts for this reaction. Interestingly, the addition of a second shorter chain ligand to the QDs appeared to be essential to complete the second catalytic cycle and to obtain the desired bicyclic tropane derivatives. Finally, the scope of the [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction was explored for the best performing QDs and isolated yields that compare well with classical iridium photocatalysis were obtained.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational Screening of New Candidate Reactions with High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of a QM&#8208;augmented&#8208;GNN, trained on a recently generated computational dataset, a vast chemical space of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions is screened for bioorthogonal potential, i.&#8201;e., a balance between speed and selectivity. A broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity is identified as a potential starting point for future experimental development of new bioorthogonal click reactions.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05&#8201;% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within &#8764;2&#8211;3&#8197;kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.

         <title>Factors Influencing the Chemoselectivity of Pd(OAc)2&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization Reactions Involving 1,6&#8208;Enynes as a Substrate and PhI(OAc)2 as a Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions.







Abstract
It is well documented in the literature that 1,6&#8208;enynes are cyclized using PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst to yield cyclopropyl ketones. In contrast, it has been reported that when 1,6&#8208;enynes are substituted by a hydroxy group at the &#945;&#8208;position to the alkyne, the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction is altered, and polycyclic oxa&#8208;heterocycles are formed. This suggests that the hydroxy substituent plays a crucial role in changing the mechanism of the reaction. The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06&#8208;D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations. This study demonstrates that the electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions. In addition, it was found that (1) the hypervalent iodine reagent PIDA serves not only as an oxidant for the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), but also as a nucleophile that drives the acetoxypalladation step of the reaction, (2) the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) by the iodonium ion [PhIOAc]+ occurs via an interesting mechanism involving coordination of [PhIOAc]+ to the Pd(II) centre, followed by a twist in the hypervalent iodine, and (3) Pd &#960;&#8208;complexes are not very susceptible to oxidation. (4) A Pd(II) complex can be six coordinate if the Pd centre is partially oxidized.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The electronic nature&lt;/b&gt; of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;-philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well documented in the literature that 1,6-enynes are cyclized using PhI(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PIDA) in the presence of Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a catalyst to yield cyclopropyl ketones. In contrast, it has been reported that when 1,6-enynes are substituted by a hydroxy group at the &#945;-position to the alkyne, the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction is altered, and polycyclic oxa-heterocycles are formed. This suggests that the hydroxy substituent plays a crucial role in changing the mechanism of the reaction. The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06-D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6-31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations. This study demonstrates that the electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;-philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions. In addition, it was found that (1) the hypervalent iodine reagent PIDA serves not only as an oxidant for the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), but also as a nucleophile that drives the acetoxypalladation step of the reaction, (2) the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) by the iodonium ion [PhIOAc]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; occurs via an interesting mechanism involving coordination of [PhIOAc]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the Pd(II) centre, followed by a twist in the hypervalent iodine, and (3) Pd &#960;-complexes are not very susceptible to oxidation. (4) A Pd(II) complex can be six coordinate if the Pd centre is partially oxidized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Solid&#8208;State Na&#8208;Ion Conductor for Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy hexagonal&#8208;prismatic Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was successfully synthesized with a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. It demonstrates an excellent electrochemical stability and a superior compatibility with sodium. Solid&#8208;state batteries based on this material deliver almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) hold great promise for their merits in low&#8208;cost, high energy density, and safety. However, developing solid electrolyte (SE) materials for SSBs with high performance is still a great challenge. In this study, high&#8208;entropy Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was synthesized at comparatively low sintering temperature of 950&#8201;&#176;C with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. More importantly, the Na symmetric cells using high&#8208;entropy SE show a high critical current density of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outstanding rate performance with fairly flat potential profiles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and steady cycling over 700&#8197;h under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Na3V2(PO4)3||high&#8208;entropy SE||Na batteries are further assembled manifesting a desirable cycling stability with almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles and high Columbic efficiency over 99.9&#8201;%. The findings present opportunities for the design of high&#8208;entropy Na&#8208;ion conductors toward the development of SSBs.

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphonium functionalization of a conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) with a stilbene core improved its spectrum of activity to include ESKAPE pathogens and mycobacteria while crucially retaining the membrane&#8208;perturbing mode of action characteristic of COEs. The efficacy of the lead compound in&#8197;vivo highlights the potential of the COE molecular platform for designing more effective antibiotics.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis enables an oxygen&#8208;sensitive energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalysed [2+2] photocycloaddition in water and under aerobic conditions. Micellar effects suppress undesired quenching of triplet states by molecular oxygen through low oxygen solubility and compartmentalization of the micellar reaction mixture. Additionally, activation of the substrates towards sensitization by hydrogen bonding in the Stern layer is proposed, allowing efficient triplet energy transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]2+.







Abstract
Micellar photocatalysis has been used to overcome oxygen quenching and enable a [2+2] photocycloaddition through triplet&#8208;energy transfer in water under aerobic conditions. The cheap and commercially available self&#8208;assembling sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were found to increase the oxygen tolerance of a typically oxygen&#8208;sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the use of the micellar solution was found to activate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds to energy transfer and allow [2+2] photocycloadditions to take place. Our preliminary studies of micellar effects on energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;based reactions demonstrate the reaction between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes in a mixture of SDS, water and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2.

Deracemization of a solid solution: The deracemization of a racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming system by using the possibility of syncrystallization, that is the formation of solid solution, with a chemically related conglomerate&#8208;forming system has been demonstrated. Based on phase diagram study, three model compounds crystallizing as racemic compounds were deracemized this way giving the evidence of the concept.







Abstract
Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror&#8208;related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence for this possibility is given in three examples by using temperature&#8208;cycling&#8208;induced deracemization.

Acid test for Tyr and Trp: S&#8208;Acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) enables the residue&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfenylation of Tyr or Trp under appropriately selected acidic reaction conditions. The dicationic intermediate derived from the Cys(Acm)(O) selectively reacts with Tyr, whereas the S&#8208;chlorocysteine allows Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation. The one&#8208;pot sequence of stapling and lipidation of peptides was achieved.

A tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208; or tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides 1 in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acid test for Tyr and Trp&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-Acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) enables the residue-selective C&#8722;H sulfenylation of Tyr or Trp under appropriately selected acidic reaction conditions. The dicationic intermediate derived from the Cys(Acm)(O) selectively reacts with Tyr, whereas the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-chlorocysteine allows Trp-selective sulfenylation. The one-pot sequence of stapling and lipidation of peptides was achieved.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range, satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties was fabricated by using anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode. The H2O molecules in the organohydrogel are fixed in the 3D polyacrylamide network through the hydrogen bond interaction of ethylene glycol and ionic hydration of LiCl, thus greatly limiting their crystallization or evaporation at extreme temperatures. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300123).

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical assay for probing the cleavage of surface&#8208;confined APP peptide substrates by BACE1 was developed based on specific chemical labeling of terminal tyrosine.







Abstract
Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite is modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag (ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is captured in microplate surface by the conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode (SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1 to 200&#8197;pM with a detection limit of 0.8&#8197;pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.

         <dc:description>
The energy storage cycle of the molecular solar thermal (MOST) system has been investigated. In particular, upon irradiation, the energy&#8208;lean 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene is converted into its energy&#8208;rich quadricyclane isomer. The energy&#8208;releasing back reaction can be triggered thermally by means of a suitable catalyst surface. The differences in the energy landscapes is visualized by sea level and mountains.

Novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been constructed by rational structural hybridization of cyanine and borondifluoride curcuminoid. The peculiar asymmetrical layout of the three key fragments endows these long&#8208;wavelength dyes with ideal photophysical properties and ER self&#8208;targeting capability. The photoluminescent mechanism, revealed by quantum chemical calculations, will greatly facilitate future exploration of cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized NIR dyes.

         <title>Organophosphorus Extractants: A Critical Choice for Actinides/Lanthanides Separation in Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of actinides from lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is a vital step of nuclear fuel cycle process. As one class of mature industrial extractants, the organophosphorus extractants have been widely used for the extraction and separation of actinides and lanthanides in spent fuel reprocessing due to their strong extraction ability and low&#8208;cost acquisition. In this concept, the application scope of tributyl phosphate (TBP), bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP), octyl(phenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO), trialkyl phosphine oxide (TRPO), and purified Cyanex 301 (bis(2,4,4&#8208;trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid, HA301) are introduced, and their extraction mechanism, as well as structure&#8208;function relationships for separation of actinides over lanthanides are also discussed. Furthermore, the design criteria, extraction properties and mechanism of several typical newly developed organophosphorus extractants (CMPO&#8208;modified calixarene/pillarene, phenanthroline&#8208;derived organophosphorus extractants, and phosphate&#8208;modified carborane) based on pre&#8208;organized skeletons are briefly reviewed. Finally, we summarize and emphasize the important role played by those organophosphorus extractants and look forward to their potential applications in separation of actinides over lanthanides in future advanced nuclear fuel cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>From chemotherapy to phototherapy &#8208; changing the therapeutic action of a metallo&#8208;intercalating RuII&#8208;ReI luminescent system by switching its sub&#8208;cellular location.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a new heterodinuclear ReIRuII metallointercalator containing RuII(dppz) and ReI(dppn) moieties is reported. Cell&#8208;free studies reveal that the complex has similar photophysical properties to its homoleptic M(dppz) analogue and it also binds to DNA with a similar affinity. However, the newly reported complex has very different in&#8208;cell properties to its parent. In complete contrast to the homoleptic system, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex is not intrinsically cytotoxic but displays appreciable phototoxic, despite both complexes displaying very similar quantum yields for singlet oxygen sensitization. Optical microscopy suggests that the reason for these contrasting biological effects is that whereas the homoleptic complex localises in the nuclei of cells, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex preferentially accumulates in mitochondria. These observations illustrate how even small structural changes in metal based therapeutic leads can modulate their mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretching the Bisalkyne Raman Spectral Palette Reveals a New Electrophilic Covalent Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small heteroaryl&#8208;diyne (Het&#8208;DY) tags with distinct vibrational frequencies, and physiologically relevant cLog P were designed for multiplexed bioorthogonal Raman imaging. Pd&#8208;Cu catalyzed coupling, combined with the use of Lei ligand, was shown to improve overall yields of the desired heterocoupled Het&#8208;Dy tags, minimizing the production of homocoupled side&#8208;products. Spectral data were in agreement with the trends predicted by DFT calculations and systematic introduction of electron&#8208;rich/poor rings stretched the frequency limit of aryl&#8208;capped diynes (2209&#8208;2243 cm&#8208;1). The improved Log P of these Het&#8208;Dy tags was evident from their diffuse distribution in cellular uptake studies and functionalizing tags with organelle markers allowed the acquisition of location&#8208;specific biological images. LC&#8208;MS&#8208; and NMR&#8208;based assays showed that some heteroaryl&#8208;capped internal alkynes are potential nucleophile traps with structure&#8208;dependent reactivity. These biocompatible Het&#8208;Dy tags, equipped with covalent reactivity, open up new avenues for Raman bioorthogonal imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#181;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X = CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn = CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2 M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depend on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8208;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et &#8594; CH2Ph replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination vs. Insertion: On the Interaction of 5d&#8208;Transition Metal Carbonyl Clusters with Silver(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The title silver(I) complex salts [Ag{Re2(CO)10}{Re(CO)5}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgRe4; ORF = &#8208;OC(CF3)3) and [Ag{Ir4(CO)12}2]+&#173;[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgIr8) form upon reaction of Ag+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and the transition metal carbonyls (TMCs) Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 respectively. The solid&#8208;state structure of the AgRe4 cluster shows an unexpected asymmetric coordination motif, wherein the silver(I) cation has inserted into the Re&#8208;Re bond of one Re2(CO)10 moiety, while the other dirhenium carbonyl coordinates only over one metal atom towards the silver(I) cation. The AgIr8 cluster is formed by the edge&#8208;on coordination of two Ir4 tetrahedra and the silver cation in a D2 symmetric fashion with a torsion angle of 46.5&#176;. The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths between the silver atom and the nearby metal atoms in all cases, whereas only the non&#8208;inserted Re2(CO)10 moiety shows additional bond paths between the carbonyl ligands and the silver cation. In addition, the insertion of the Ag+ cation into the Re&#8208;Re bond in Re2(CO)10 removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered TMC donors W(CO)6 &lt; Re2(CO)10 &lt; Os3(CO)12 &lt; Ir4(CO)12. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;&#8208;donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag+&#8592;[TMC].</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Light&#8208;mediated Protocol for the Direct Amide Bond Formation via a Novel Carboxylic Acid Photoactivation Mode by Pyridine&#8211;CBr4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct amide bond formation between a carboxylic acid and an amine still constitutes a challenging reaction for both academia and industry. We demonstrate herein that several pairs of amines (halogen bond acceptors) and organohalogen sources may be used for the photochemical amidation reaction under either UVA or sunlight irradiation. Our studies led to the identification of pyridine&#8211;CBr4 as an efficient agent to perform synthesis of amides under LED 370 nm irradiation, avoiding super&#8208;stoichiometric quantities. An extended substrate scope was demonstrated, showing that the widely used amino and carboxyl protecting groups are compatible with this photochemical protocol, while a number of industrially interesting products and bioactive compounds were synthesized. Direct infusion&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry studies suggest an unprecedented type of carboxylic acid activation mode upon irradiation, involving the generation of a symmetric anhydride, an active ester with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and a mixed anhydride with hypobromous acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Screening of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial for renewable energy technologies. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) methods and microkinetic simulations, we systematically investigated the ORR catalytic performance of a series of 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks M3(HADQ)2 (HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline). It shows that all 2D M3(HADQ)2 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh and Pd) monolayers are metallic, due to &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystal orbitals centered on the central metals and ligand N atoms. The catalytic activity of M3(HADQ)2 depends on the binding strength between ORR intermediates and metal species, and can be tuned via changing the central metals. Among these candidates, Rh3(HADQ)2 and Co3(HADQ)2 show superior ORR performance to Pt (111) with high half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.99 and 0.93 V, respectively. Moreover, the screened two catalysts have excellent intermediate&#8208;tolerance ability for dynamic coverage of oxygenated species on the active sites. Our work provides a new path towards developing efficient ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of the Reaction of Elemental Sulfur and Polysulfides with Cyanide and Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of elemental sulfur (S8) and polysulfides with nucleophiles are relevant to organic synthesis, materials science and biochemistry, but the mechanisms by which they operate are still unknown due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // &#969;B97X&#8208;D/ aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, we studied the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. All plausible pathways including nucleophilic decomposition, unimolecular decomposition, scrambling reactions, and attack on thiosulfoxides, have been considered to provide the first comprehensive mechanistic picture for this class of reactions. Overall, intramolecular cyclization is identified as the most favorable decomposition pathway for long polysulfides. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition, nucleophilic attack, and scrambling pathways can be expected.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new mononuclear cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S5)] (3) has been synthesized using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R = Ph, 2a; 2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H4, 2b), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)2Co2]2+ (1). Compound 3 features a low spin, diamagnetic, Co(III) centre with a coordinated pentasulfido (S52&#8315;) chain and has no precedence in the literature. Compound 3 is highly stable towards reduction with a potential of &#8208;1.36 V (vs. Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe) and gives back 1 upon chemical/electrochemical reduction. Reaction of 3 with phosphines yields back 1 and phosphine sulfides, while protonation of the coordinated S52&#8315; chain in 3 leads to the formation of 1, elemental sulfur and H2S. Finally, transfer of the coordinated S52&#8315; chain in 3 to selected organic compounds, such as MeI, PhCH2Br and PhCOCl, for the generation of organopolysulfido compounds has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A set of 16&#8201;chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable NHCs was synthesized in good yields with excellent enantiomeric purities (up &gt;99.75&#8201;:&#8201;0.25&#8197;er). The chiral BIAN&#8208;based Ru&#8208;complexes Ru&#8208;4&#8201;g was the most efficient to catalyse the AROCM of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;norbornenes (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Successfully converted into its corresponding Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex Z&#8208;Ru&#8208;5, the latter demonstrated high efficiency in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes in &gt;98&#8201;% Z&#8208;selectivity and the highest enantioselectivities reported so far (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).







Abstract
A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral atropBIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).

         <title>Correlation of Experimental and Calculated Reaction Enthalpies with Ligand Donor Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calorimetric studies on the formation of [(YPhos)AuCl] complexes confirmed the high binding strength of these ligands. The reaction enthalpies are shown to be easily obtained by calculations and correlate with the phosphine donor properties thus representing an interesting problem&#8208;specific descriptor for ligands in gold catalysis.







Abstract
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) have recently proven to be strongly donating ligands that enable high catalyst activities in gold(I)&#8208;mediated transformations. We now report on a calorimetric study dealing with the [Au(YPhos)Cl] system and assess YPhos&#8208;Au bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy&#8208;to&#8208;obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis and Characterization of Indenone Azine&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Accepting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be more accepting: Indenone azines, in which two indene units are cross&#8208;conjugated by an exocyclic azine (C=N&#8722;N=C) moiety, have been synthesized in a stereocontrolled manner. The azine moiety makes indenone azines planar structure and gives enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character, thus making them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks.







Abstract
Indenone azines, in which the exocyclic C=C bond in dibenzopentafulvalene is replaced by an azine moiety (C=N&#8722;N=C), have been synthesized as novel electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds. Structural modulation at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions of indenone azines enabled stereoselective syntheses of diastereomers in which the configurations of the two C=N bonds are E,E or Z,Z. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that all the indenone azines exhibit high coplanarity in contrast to the twisted frameworks of dibenzopentafulvalene derivatives, resulting in the formation of densely &#960;&#8208;stacked structures. Electrochemical measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed the electron&#8208;accepting character of indenone azines comparable to isoindigo dyes. In particular, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives impart enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and significantly red&#8208;shifted photoabsorption. This study demonstrates that indenone azines represent a promising candidate as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks for optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Copper Activation Enabling Reversible Aqueous Cu&#8722;ZnS Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries have been proposed: ZnS is gradually activated by copper to form CuS under electric field during cycling. The formed CuS undergoes a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S for energy storage. The introduction of sphalerite activation in the field of mining and metallurgy provides an idea for the design of materials design for aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries (AMSBs) have attracted research interest due to their high capacity, environmentally friendly qualities, and the accessibility of raw materials. However, the design strategies for metal&#8208;sulfide cathode have rarely been reported. Here, the copper&#8208;activated sphalerite in which Zn2+ is substituted by Cu2+ through ion exchange has been introduced for the first time as cathode for aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries. After sphalerite transformed to CuS, a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S storage mechanism has been proposed. At 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density, the capacity can reach 532.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. When cycled once at a current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial reversible capacity can reach 461&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the assembled Zn//ZnS hybrid ion cell delivers an energy of up to 460&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is better than for many AMSBs.

         <title>Interface Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells through Potassium Citrate Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of potassium citrate (PC) passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficiency and stability are key factors determining the final cost of electricity that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generate. To date, effective strategy to progress in achieving efficient and stable PSCs is still a difficult problem that researchers continue to explore. This study reports a useful way to improve the quality of SnO2 film by introducing potassium citrate (PC) into SnO2 nanoparticles solution. PC passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2. The resultant photovoltaic (PV) device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.79&#8201;%. The introduction of PC interface also significantly suppress the degradation of PSCs, by which 87.6&#8201;% of initial PCE is maintained after 2850&#8197;h storage in ambient environment. Moreover, the devices retained 95.5&#8201;% of initial PCE under 1&#8208;sun continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Construction of Pd&#8208;Co&#8208;doped CdS heterojunctions as efficient platforms in photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present the structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of CdS semiconducting nanostructures, doped with palladium&#8208; and cobalt&#8208;based species. XRD analysis, corroborated by Raman and XPS, demonstrated the growth of CdS crystallites in the hexagonal structure, whereas solvothermal conversion of neat precursor metal salts resulted in the formation of metallic Pd and cobalt oxide, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy imaging certified the dendritic structure of hybrids, especially in the case where CdS was grown in the presence of either palladium&#8208; or cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles. XPS surface analysis revealed that a major fraction of metallic Pd nanoparticles was converted to PdO during the in situ growth of CdS nanoparticles. The oxidation of Pd nanoparticles could be ascribed to chemisorption of oxygen phases onto the metal surface. The presence of cocatalyst nanoparticles resulted in an appreciable shift of the absorption edge of the ternary hybrids by about 50 nm. The optimized hybrid was found to photodegrade Orange G dye almost quantitatively within 2 h, by simulated solar light irradiation. Scavenging experiments revealed that hydroxy radicals were the main transient intermediate, leading to the oxidative degradation of the dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Differences in Ambident Reactivity between the Cyanate, Thiocyanate Ions, and their P&#8208; and As&#8208;Containing Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the cyanate and thiocyanate anions belong to the most known textbook examples of ambident nucleophiles, the electronic factors that determine their markedly differing reactivities are still unclear. Their recently discovered P&#8208; and As&#8208;containing [PCX]&#8211; and [AsCX]&#8211;analogues (X: O, S, Se), whose ambident nature is practically unexplored, may serve as ideal basis for comparison to clarify these differences. Herein we present comprehensive theoretical investigations on the nucleophilic behaviours of the whole set of so far known [ECX]&#8211;(E: N, P, As, X: O, S, Se) anions, aiming for a systematic understanding of the reactivity patterns and deciphering the factors that govern the nucleophilic substitutions. Our results indicate that the SN2 reactions of the O&#8208;containing [ECO]&#8211; ions are thermodynamically preferred at the E pnictogen centres, while the kinetic contributions are only substantial for the N&#8208;containing [NCX]&#8211;anions. The ambident reactivities of the congeners that contain N or O significantly differ from those with P, As, S, or Se heteroatoms, in line with the inert s&#8208;orbital effect, characteristic for the heavier elements. By analysing the electronic structures and bonding patterns of the anions and relevant transition state structures, we offer clear explanations for the differing reactivities of the whole set of [ECX]&#8211;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Can NbO Keep nbo Topology under Electrons? &#8211;Unveiling Novel Aspects of Niobium Monoxide at Atomic Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A precise investigation of NbO has been carried out by advanced electron microscopy combined with powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). The structure of pristine NbO has been determined as Pm&#8208;3m space group (SG) with a=4.211 &#197; and the positions of Nb and O at the 3c and 3d Wyckoff positions, respectively, which is consistent with previous report based on powder XRD data. Electron beams induced a structural transition, which was investigated and explained by combining electron diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution imaging. The results revealed that the electron beam stimulated both Nb and O atom&#8208;migrations within each fcc sublattice, and that the final structure was SG Fm&#8208;3m with a=4.29 &#197;, Nb and O at the 4a and 4b with 75% occupancy and same chemical composition. Antiphase planar defects were discovered in the pristine NbO and related to the structural transformation. Theoretical calculations performed by density functional theory (DFT) supported the experimental conclusions.</dc:description>

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effects toward Dual&#8208;State Emissive Bright Red and Near&#8208;infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission effect (REE) was discovered and resulted in a novel dye family of hydrostyryl pyridinium derivatives in our recent work. Herein, REE effect was employed to design red and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;state emissive fluorophore family of SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s which were further easily synthesized by couple an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) onto nitro(hydroxyl)styryl (S&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) through a C=C double bond as &#960;&#8208;bridge. The deprotonation of phenolic hydroxyl group promoted by nitro group and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) in the other side of &#960;&#8208;bridge triggered resonance and resulting in significantly red&#8208;shifted emission. All the resultant SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s showed excellent dual&#8208;state emission behaviors. Remarkably, hydrostyryl quinolinium (SQ&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) is one of the smallest NIR emitters molecular skeleton (&#955;em = 725 nm, MW&lt;400) and showed dual&#8208;state emission characteristics and obvious viscosity&#8208;depended fluorescent behaviors. In addition to constructing electron donor&#8208;accepter structure and prolonging &#960;&#8208;bridge, REE effected promised a reliable strategy toward novel fluorophores with small size, long emissive wavelength, and dual&#8208;emission characteristics, and importantly, feasible industrial manufactures and applications due to their easy and low&#8208;cost synthesis strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>BAr2&#8208;bridged Azafulvene Dimers with Tunable Energy Levels for Photostable Near&#8208;infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes with strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are potentially useful in medical applications such as tumor imaging and photothermal therapy. In this work, we synthesized new NIR dyes combining BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer acceptors with diarylaminothienyl donors in a donor&#8722;acceptor&#8722;donor configuration. Surprisingly, we found that in these molecules the BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene acceptor adopts a 5&#8208;membered, rather than 6&#8208;membered ring structure. The influence of the aryl substituents on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye compounds was assessed from electrochemical and optical measurements. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents (Ar = C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) lowered the HOMO energy while preserving the small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, resulting in promising NIR dye molecules that combine strong absorption bands centered around 900 nm with good photostability.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.g. Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation via neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure activity relationships (ASARs).</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Approach for the Synthesis of Site&#8208;Specific Thioether Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioconjugation methodologies have become a central part of therapeutic development. Conjugation of thiol&#8208;containing compounds is now simple with this ionic liquid&#8208;mediated reaction which is site&#8208;specific toward thiol and preserves the stereochemistry. Additionally, Cysteine&#8208;free peptides can be functionalized using the developed technique.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.

By the Bi: The bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+, stabilized by an [SbF6]&#8722; counteranion, has been synthesized, isolated and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). A detailed comparison with [BiMe2(SbF6)] highlights the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity.

Abstract
The molecular compound [BiDipp2(SbF6)], containing the bulky, donor&#8208;free bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+ has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Using its methyl analog [BiMe2(SbF6)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity was investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and modified Gutmann&#8208;Beckett methods) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards [PF6]&#8722; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively. The first examples of compounds featuring bismuth&#8208;bound isocyanides have been isolated and fully characterized.

         <title>Molecular Shape, Electronic Factors, and the Ferroelectric Nematic Phase: Investigating the Impact of Structural Modifications</title>

Molecular shape and its effects: The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens is reported comparing the effect of having a lateral alkoxy chain in the central phenyl ring versus the chain being attached to the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. Rather than the molecule being required to show a tapered shape, it is the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations that is key.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to the central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited an N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of the ferroelectric nematic&#8208;nematic transition temperature, T
, exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically on the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour was found when the transition temperatures of the NF phase were compared which are higher for the NT3F.m series. This may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of the NT3F.m series compared to the NT3.m series. Therefore, it is suggested that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent cages allow for the detection of the persistent organic pollutant chlordecone in water at environmental concentrations. The reported method is inexpensive, easy to carry out, and of general use for generating many measurements on contaminated water samples. This provides an affordable tool to tackle the major environmental and public health issues associated with chlordecone contamination.







Abstract
Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. This study reports on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted the choice of hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, were optimized to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed the development of a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Based on its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane, concentration, CLD concentrations were estimated over five orders of magnitude (10&#8722;2&#8211;103&#8197;&#956;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Synthesis of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective electrophilic activation of amides and enols/ketones has been achieved using either Hendrickson reagent in combination with triflic anhydride or triflic acid, which provides an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of polysubstituted indoles with flexible substituent patterns from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides or their enol&#8208;keto tautomeric mixture.







Abstract
A facile and efficient synthesis of polysubstituted indoles from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides, or their tautomeric mixture via electrophilic activation strategy is described. The salient feature of this methodology is the use of either combined Hendrickson reagent and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) or triflic acid (TfOH) to control the chemoselectivity in the intramolecular cyclodehydration to provide a predictable approach to these valuable indoles with flexible substituent patterns. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions, simple execution, high chemoselectivity, excellent yields, and wide range of synthetic potential of products make this protocol much attractive for academic research and practical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Open&#8208;Close Motion of a Chiral Molecular Plier to Modulate Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered configuration change (azobenzene) of one end of a molecular plier induces an interlocking motion at the other end (porphyrin unit) of the plier accompanied by a pivotal motion around the BINOL axis. E to Z isomerization decreases the distance between two porphyrin units which could be used for selective binding of pyridine&#8208;appended guests. Guest complexation with the plier increases the isomerization efficiency of azobenzene and decreases the thermal back isomerization rate.







Abstract
A chiral molecular plier's design, synthesis, characterisation and operations are presented. The molecular plier encompasses three units: a BINOL unit which acts as a pivot as well as a chiral inducer, an azobenzene unit, which acts as a photo&#8208;switchable component and two zinc porphyrin, acting as a reporter. E to Z isomerisation persuaded by irradiating with 370&#8197;nm light alters the dihedral angle of the pivot BINOL unit, which adjusts the distance between two porphyrin units. The plier can be switched to its initial state by exposure to 456&#8197;nm light or heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C. NMR, CD and molecular modelling supported the reversible switching and change in dihedral angle and distance between reporter moiety, which was further exploited for binding with several ditopic guests. The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, R,R&#8208;isomer formed a stronger complex than S,S&#8208;isomer, Z&#8208;isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the E&#8208;isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.

         <title>An Umpolung Approach to Acyclic 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Amides via Photoredox&#8208;Generated Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis is used to generate carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts. Addition to a range of electron&#8208;poor olefins gives the 1,4&#8208;amido&#8208;carbonyl products in good yields. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, and a transition metal or organic photocatalyst can be employed.







Abstract
A method for the generation and reaction of carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts, followed by reaction with electron&#8208;poor olefins, is described. The oxamate salt acts as a reductive quencher in the photoredox catalytic cycle, allowing mild and mass&#8208;efficient formation of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products; a challenging transformation in the context of functionalized amide formation. Increased understanding has been obtained by the use of ab initio calculations, in support of experimental observations. Furthermore, steps have been taken towards an environmentally&#8208;friendly protocol, by utilizing sodium as a cheap and low mass counterion, and demonstrating successful reactions using a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and a sustainable, non&#8208;toxic solvent system.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photoredox catalysis&lt;/b&gt; is used to generate carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts. Addition to a range of electron-poor olefins gives the 1,4-amido-carbonyl products in good yields. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, and a transition metal or organic photocatalyst can be employed.

         <title>A Cyclodextrin Polymer as Supramolecular Matrix for Scalable Green Photooxygenation of Hydrophobic Substrates in Homogeneous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic endoperoxides were synthesized as O2 releasing agents in organic solvent upon irradiation of a photocatalyst in the presence of the precursors in mM concentration. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both reactants in a cyclodextrin polymer allowed to successfully perform the photocatalyzed oxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment. Controlled release of O2 could be achieved upon thermolysis.







Abstract
In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2 in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.

         <title>A Highly Active Cobalt Catalyst for the General and Selective Hydrogenation of Aromatic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active cobalt catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;heterocycles was identified. The key is a simple three component catalyst synthesis permitting to optimize the ratio between N&#8208;doped carbon for embedding and the metal species to be embedded.







Abstract
Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. This study introduces a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying this catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.

         <title>Tailoring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Strategy for Sequence&#8208;Dependent and Thermo/pH Dual&#8208;Responsive Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of monomer sequence for desired properties is challenging. This study investigates the effect of monomer distribution of double hydrophilic copolymers (DHCs) with electron&#8208;rich units on cluster triggered emission (CTE) capacity. By means of combining latent monomer strategy, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and selective hydrolysis technology, the random, pseudo di&#8208;block and the gradient DHCs consisting of pH&#8208;responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA) segments and thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) segments were successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. Moreover, the gradient DHCs showed a tremendously increased luminescent intensity due to the distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction compared to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported the direct correlation between luminescent intensity and sequence structure of non&#8208;conjugated polymer. Meanwhile, thermo and pH dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence could be easily performed. This work demonstrates a novel and facile method to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;bonding for the stimuli&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitting polymers.</dc:description>

Preparation of spherical polymeric particles via surfactant&#8208;free RAFT emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) with reversible swelling behavior upon UV/Vis light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) assembled by monodisperse colloidal particles have attracted enormous interest recently due to their tremendous applications in smart devices. Their structural colors can be determined by particle sizes. However, the lack of a reliable way to tune the sizes in&#8197;situ limits their development. Herein, we present an efficient route to solve this problem through the fabrication of spherical polymeric particles with light&#8208;triggered reversible swelling behavior via surfactant&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Amphiphilic macro&#8208;RAFT agents containing azobenzene groups were synthesized and subsequently employed to mediate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Uniform submicron spheres were obtained by modulating solid contents and other parameters. Benefiting from the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties, the particle sizes expanded and contracted upon alternative ultraviolet/visible&#8208;light irradiation accordingly. This strategy will be a supplement to the emulsion PISA and especially give aid to the progress of the RPC materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, of which sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core.

Abstract
A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids wasproposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed. In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4&#945;&#8208;formamidogorgon&#8208;11&#8208;ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95&#8197;&#956;M.

In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-formamidogorgon-11-ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;M.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Non Expected Alternative Ni(0) Species in the Ni&#8208;Catalytic Aldehyde and Alcohol Arylation Reactions Facilitated by a 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
As in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, in the alcohol arylation reaction catalysed by a system combining nickel and a 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand, the presence of a Ni(0) intermediate is under debate by Density Functional Theory calculations.







Abstract
For decades there were many attempts to dispense with stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents for the synthesis of secondary alcohols. In 2021, the synthetic results of Newman and collaborators pioneered a synthesis still with metals, but not as reactants. Instead, they serverd as catalytic engines. Here we present a description by means of Density Functional Theory calculations of how this process can occur, and an attempt is made to shed light on the mechanism that facilitates the attainment of secondary alcohols, emphasizing the eternal cross&#8208;coupling debate of whether the catalytically active species is Ni(0) or they are really taking shortcuts following the course of Ni(II). Effective Orbital analyses give a clear picture. Furthermore, this paper provides insight not only into the nature of the ligands of the metal catalyst but also the role of the base.

         <title>Control of Selectivity in Homogeneous Catalysis through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity directing mission of noncovalent interactions (hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen and tetrel bonds, as well as agostic and &#960;&#8208;interactions) in homogeneous catalysis is highlighted. The origin of the selectivity in noncovalent catalysis has been investigated through experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
The regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, stereo&#8208; or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi&#8208;steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst&#8208;substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The regio-, site-, stereo- or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal-ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi-steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst-substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
