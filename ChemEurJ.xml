         <title>Contrasting Reactions of Carbodiimides With Divalent Lanthanoid Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of lanthanoid species with carbodiimides show considerable variety. Treatment of the divalent complex, [Sm(OArEt)2(thf)3] with N,N'&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrNCNiPr) resulted in the formation of the oxalamidinatosamarium(III) complex [(OArEt)&#8322;Sm(&#956;&#8208;C&#8322;N&#8324;iPr&#8324;)Sm(OArEt)&#8322;]&#183;2PhMe. In contrast, the use of the bulkier N,N'&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (CyNCNCy) led to the formation of a formamidinatosamarium(III) complex [Sm(OArEt)2(CyNC(H)NCy)(thf)2]&#183;2thf. Reactions between rare earth metals (RE = Yb, Eu) with Hg(PhCC)2 and N,N'&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (CyNCNCy) yielded trivalent [YbIII{CyNC(C&#8801;CPh)NCy}3]&#8901;2thf and divalent [Eu{CyNC(C&#8801;CPh)NCy}&#8322;(thf)&#8322;].








Abstract
Reactions of lanthanoid species with carbodiimides (RN &#9552; C &#9552; NR&#8242;) show considerable variety. Thus, treatment of the divalent 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;ethylphenolatosamarium complex, [Sm(OArEt)2(thf)3]&#183;PhMe with N,N'&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrNCNiPr) resulted in the formation of the oxalamidinatosamarium(III) complex [(OArEt)&#8322;Sm(&#956;&#8208;C&#8322;N&#8324;iPr&#8324;)Sm(OArEt)&#8322;]&#183;2PhMe (1). In contrast, the use of the bulkier N,N'&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (CyNCNCy) led to the formation of a formamidinatosamarium(III) complex [Sm(OArEt)2(CyNC(H)NCy)(thf)2]&#8901;2thf (2). Reactions between rare earth metals (RE = Yb, Eu) with one molar equivalent of bis(phenylethynyl)mercury (Hg(PhCC)2) and two molar equivalents of N,N'&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (CyNCNCy) in tetrahydrofuran (thf) at room temperature yielded lanthanoid C&#8208;phenylethynylamidinate complexes, trivalent [YbIII{CyNC(C&#8801;CPh)NCy}3]&#183;2thf (3) and divalent [Eu{CyNC(C&#8801;CPh)NCy}&#8322;(thf)&#8322;] (4). [Sm(OArEt)2(thf)3].PhMe was obtained from SmI2(thf)2 and the in situ generated potassium aryl oxide and is a five&#8208;coordinate monomer with a stereochemistry between trigonal bipyramidal and square pyramidal.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis Under Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides an overview of advancements in confinement&#8208;aided photoredox catalysis, spanning across well&#8208;established heterogeneous frameworks to emerging homogeneous single&#8208;chain polymers. Focus is placed upon design elements that enable spatial proximity of cocatalysts which, in turn, provides optimal electron, energy, and/or radical transfers. Collectively, the architectures discussed herein underscore the importance of confinement in tackling diffusion limitations in catalysis.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a potent means to conduct synthetic chemistry. Leveraging light to achieve challenging organic transformations has led to many developments, both of fundamental and industrial nature. Despite their potency, photoredox processes are inherently diffusion controlled, which can limit their ability to enable both reactivity and selectivity. Relevant to this is the idea of colocalizing cocatalysts in architectures that enable spatial proximity, promoting &#8216;catalysis under confinement.&#8217; In this Concept review, we summarize recent designs and advancements using well&#8208;defined heterogeneous and homogeneous frameworks that enable dual photoredox catalysis, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks, heterogeneous organic polymeric systems, and single&#8208;chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs). These advances generally stem from the material's inherent ability to enforce catalyst communication, typically resulting in expedient radical, electron, or energy transfer that accelerates reactivity. Whereas heterogeneous systems are comprehensively investigated, the design space arising from the modularity and versatility of a SCNP is quite large making the recyclable platform an intriguing candidate to investigate for confinement&#8208;enabled photoredox catalysis. We expect that both heterogeneous and homogeneous platforms systems detailed herein will continue to exhibit superior performance, while underscoring the importance of confinement to tackle diffusion&#8208;limited reactions.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Toughened Polymer Networks: The Mighty Impact of Specially Designed Rings on Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;shaped compounds, such as 2D metallacycles and 3D cages, possess fixed geometric structures, adsorption capabilities, and reversible dynamic properties. When specially designed rings are incorporated as crosslinking points or integrated into the backbone structure, they can significantly improve the mechanical properties of polymer networks by releasing hidden lengths and undergoing conformational changes. This review summarizes recent research progress in regulating the mechanical properties of polymer networks through the introduction of ring structures.







Abstract
Polymer network materials are gaining significance in daily life and industrial applications. Improving polymer network materials&#8217; mechanical properties has long been a focus for chemists and materials scientists. Generally, rings in networks are viewed as adverse elements leading to reduced mechanical performance. In this conceptual article, recent advancements and related strategies in utilizing specially designed rings to enhance the mechanical properties of polymer networks are summarized and discussed. The article concludes by discussing current challenges and future prospects in this field. We aim for this article to offer readers an overview of ring&#8208;toughened polymer networks and to catalyze swift progress in this burgeoning area.

         <title>Unlocking New Frontiers: Photo&#8208;Isomerism and Magnetic Properties in Multifunctional Hetero&#8208;Tetra&#8208;Metallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis, structural characterisation, and magnetic properties of hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, denoted as FeNOCuLnCo, (with Ln=Gd, Tb, or Dy). These complexes mark a significant milestone as the first examples of polyfunctional compounds containing four different metallic ions, exhibiting dual properties: reversible photo&#8208;isomerism and single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour.







Abstract
Hetero&#8208;tetra&#8208;metallic complexes, FeNOCuLnCo (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy), combining magnetic properties and photo&#8208;isomerism, were obtained through the rational assembly of the photo&#8208;switching nitroprusside anion FeNO with new magnetic Schiff base CuLnCo precursors. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterisation of these compounds followed by a demonstration of their multifunctional character. Particularly noteworthy is the FeNOCuTbCo complex which is one of the few examples of a photo&#8208;isomerisable SMM.

         <title>Near&#8208;Neutral pH Sensing by Azoheteroarene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes with thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls that detect pH changes in near&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. They exhibit unique light absorption and notable color changes within a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye.







Abstract
We serendipitously discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes capable of detecting pH variations in near&#8208;neutral solutions. These dyes feature thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls linked to hydroxyphenyl azo groups. They exhibit distinctive light absorption properties in aqueous solutions and show notable color changes in a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye. Both experimental data and quantum calculations suggest a plausible mechanism for their function as pH indicators. Additionally, these azoheteroarene dyes effectively monitor pH in complex environments, and we show their use for detecting the pH change of culture medium containing growing cancer cells.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox&#8208;Active Catholyte Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoxybenzenes (AOB) exhibit unique redox behavior with potential for energy storage systems. In this article, we investigate their electrochemical properties and demonstrate a promising reversible oxidation. However, capacity decay during cycling due to unstable intermediates poses a challenge, necessitating the exploration of stabilization strategies to exploit the full potential of AOBs in energy storage applications.







Abstract
Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen&#8208;substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox&#8208;active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro&#8208;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.

         <title>Technetium and Rhenium Auto&#8208;reduction, Polymerization and Lability towards Group VII Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pertechnetate and perrhenate auto&#8208;reduce, leading to coordination geometries suitable for polyoxometalate (POM) assembly. Evaporation of pertechnic acid leads to the prior&#8208;reported [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722;. Evaporation of perrhenic acid yields (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O, the first evidence for Re auto&#8208;reduction, prior known for the lighter group VII congeners. Combined perrhenate and pertechnetate yield the [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; polyanion, the first group VII mixed&#8208;metal POM.







Abstract
Group VII Tc and Re have long been studied to develop both radiopharmaceuticals and technologies for nuclear materials management. Fundamental research has targeted understanding this periodic table crossroads where polyoxometalates meets metal&#8208;metal bonded complexes. Here we have isolated green hygroscopic and metastable crystals of (ReVI,oct)2(ReVII,tet)2(OH)2(O)12&#8901;H2O (ReVI,VII&#8208;green, tet=tetrahedral, oct=octahedral), determined by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition to color, Re&#8208;L1 X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy confirms the reduced oxidation state. ReVI,VII&#8208;green provides the first demonstration of Re autoreduction, long&#8208;observed for Mn and Tc. We also isolated and structurally characterized [Tc4O4(H2O)2(ReO4)14]2&#8722; (Tc4Re14) polyanion crystals that contain Tc(V) and Re(VII), consistent with greater stability of reduced Tc compared to reduced Re. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering of both compounds and prior&#8208;reported polyanion [Tc4O4(H2O)2(TcO4)14]4&#8722; (Tc20) dissolved in acetonitrile indicated a qualitative lability order of oxo&#8208;linkages of Re&#8208;O&#8722;Re &gt; Re&#8208;O&#8722;Tc &gt;Tc&#8208;O&#8722;Tc, and lability of Tc20 was also probed by 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Computation provided insight into 99Tc chemical shifts as well as lability. Based on both reducibility and solution phase dynamics of polynuclear compounds investigated here, Re is an imperfect surrogate for Tc, and further expansion of group VII polyoxometalate chemistry seems promising.

         <title>Asymmetric Amination of 1,2&#8208;Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, economical and operationally simple approach to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols was developed through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen amination pathway. The chiral amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohol prepared through this highly efficient protocol is a fundamental core structure in drug candidates, chiral ligands, and organo&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio&#8208;convergent amination of &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols. The racemic &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate&#8208;mediated RuCl3 catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox&#8208;neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru&#8208;catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.

The racemic &#945;-tertiary 1,2-diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate-mediated RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally-relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox-neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru-catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step- and atom-economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Here, an electron transfer between malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylide and enol in&#8197;situ generated from 1,3&#8208;diketones induces a cyclization reaction, giving a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields.







Abstract
While iodonium ylides are important reactants in a wide range of reactions, the exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Herein, we describe a direct cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylides to give a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields. The control experiments suggest that the electron transfer between enol and iodonium ylide gives reactive species, thus enabling a cyclization cascade process to take place to give dihydrofurans.

A skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins involving rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide or triazanium salts.







Abstract
We present a skeletal editing strategy for transforming isoindolines into tetralins via a cascade N&#8208;atom removal deconstruction followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between in&#8197;situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethanes and activated alkenes. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent stereoselectivity, and high yields, demonstrating its applicability to complex bioactive compounds and natural products. Notably, case studies showcase the efficient construction of challenging spirocyclic and bridged systems, underscoring the method's versatility and potential for advancing applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Thionated Coumarins: Study of the Intersystem Crossing and the Zero&#8208;field Splitting of the Triplet State Using Time&#8208;Resolved Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>

Thionation Induces Ultrafast ISC but Short Triplet Lifetime: Two thionated coumarin derivatives were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and ultrafast intersystem crossing were observed, but the triplet state lifetimes become shorter upon thionation. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect of the thionated carbonyls.







Abstract
To study the effect of thionation of the carbonyl groups in a chromophore, i.&#8201;e. replacing the O atom with S atom, on the photophysics, we studied two thionated coumarin derivatives (Cou&#8208;S and Cou&#8208;6&#8208;S) with various steady state and transient spectroscopic methods. Both compounds exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption (up to 4900&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and strong fluorescence quenching as compared to the unthionated analogues. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast ISC (ca. 10&#8197;ps) in the thionated coumarin derivatives, while negligible ISC was observed in the unthionated coumarin. Interestingly, triplet excited state lifetimes of the thionated coumarin (0.14&#8197;&#956;s) is much shorter than the unthionated analogues (53.4&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate much larger zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameters (up to 0.287&#8197;cm&#8722;1) for the T1 state of the thionated coumarins than the unthionated analogues (D=0.1001&#8197;cm&#8722;1). This large D value is attributed to the strong spin orbital coupling effect. These results demonstrate the advantage and the drawback of thionation&#8208;enhanced ISC, i.&#8201;e. the ISC is efficient, but triplet state lifetimes become substantially shorter. This information is useful for the future design of heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photon upconversion, photocatalytic organic synthesis and photopolymerization, etc.

         <title>Base&#8208;Induced Apparent Inverted Solvatochromism in Pyridinium Phenolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of base choice on the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes was investigated. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra revealed that methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide causes apparent inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes. Based on these findings, recommendations have been made for methodologies used to compare novel solvatochromic dyes against benchmark dyes.







Abstract
Due to conflicting reports regarding the solvatochromism of &#960;&#8208;extended pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes, the choice of base (N,N,N&#8216;,N&#8216;&#8208;tetramethylguanidine or 1&#8197;M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in methanol) used to deprotonate the dyes was investigated. Three known dyes were synthesized and their UV&#8208;vis absorbance spectra were measured in a range of solvent using the two bases and the zwitterionic forms of the dyes. It was found that the methanolic tetrabutylammonium hydroxide could cause the appearance of inverted solvatochromism in negatively solvatochromic dyes when used in solvents of sufficiently low polarity. This was attributed to the presence of the polar, hydrogen bond donating methanol which preferentially solvates the dye, increasing the polarity it observes. Informed by these results, recommendations are presented for the methods used to compare solvatochromic dyes.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Biophysical Characterization of Pyridine Bis&#8208;Quinazoline Derivatives as Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex DNA Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA. Biophysical assays reveal strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double&#8208;stranded DNA, with propylamine linkers showing superior performance. Cell viability studies confirm intracellular activity and anticancer potential, highlighting these compounds as promising G4&#8208;stabilizing agents for drug development.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis&#8208;quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4&#8211;5&#8197;step sequence in high yields.

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen novel pyridine bis-quinazoline derivatives are designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G-quadruplex (G4) DNA. Biophysical assays reveal strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double-stranded DNA, with propylamine linkers showing superior performance. Cell viability studies confirm intracellular activity and anticancer potential, highlighting these compounds as promising G4-stabilizing agents for drug development.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-canonical G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures play key roles in cellular regulation and are promising targets for cancer therapy. This study reports the design, synthesis, and biophysical evaluation of 15 novel pyridine bis-quinazoline derivatives for their ability to selectively bind and stabilize G4 DNA structures. The pyridine-bis-quinazoline central fragment was synthesized with various amine side chains via a 4&#8211;5&#8197;step sequence in high yields. Comprehensive analyses using different fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID), circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) assays revealed strong G4 stabilization and selectivity over double-stranded DNA. The presence and composition of the aliphatic amine side chain proved critical and propylamine linkers exhibited superior performance, achieving &#916;T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values exceeding 20&#8201;&#176;C and dissociation constants in the nanomolar range. Structural preferences were observed for parallel and hybrid G4 topologies, and the ligands induced minimal conformational changes in G4 DNA upon binding. Finally, cell viability assays on HCT-8 and HepG2 cancer cell lines revealed that most ligands effectively entered the cells and decreased cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. These findings underline the potential of pyridine bis-quinazoline derivatives as selective G4-stabilizing agents, paving the way for further exploration in anticancer drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Defined Layered 2D Sulfur Nanosheets from 0D Sulfur Dots and their use in the Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Aryl Amines to Aromatic Azo Compounds</title>

Formation of 2D multi&#8208;layered sulfur sheets from 0D sulfur dots with improved crystallinity, effective light harvesting, less exciton binding energy with effective free charge carriers separation for efficient photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
A highly defined multi&#8208;layered 2D sulphur nanosheets have been prepared from 0D sulphur dots by hydrothermal based growth process. Slow transformation of sulphur dots to sulphur sheets allow reorganization of elemental sulphur and sulphur containing functional groups, resulting higher crystallinity in sulphur nanosheets with respect to sulphur dots. It is further correlated with the detailed photophysical studies. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra confirm that the exciton binding energy of 2D sulphur sheets are lower than 0D sulphur dots. The exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is also higher in sulphur sheet with respect to sulphur dots. Overall, the photoinduced charge separation process improves throughout the highly defined 2D matrix of sulphur sheets. It is further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photocurrent studies. Finally, both sulphur dots and sulphur sheets have been used for photocatalytic azo bond formation where both photoinduced electrons and holes have been utilized simultaneously. Results suggest almost 3 folds enhancement in catalytic efficiency for sulphur sheets with respect to sulphur dots without any metal co&#8208;catalyst. Controlled experiments suggest that the azo bond formation happens through complete photocatalysis process. Detailed mechanism has been proved by identifying the intermediates and free radicals through photo&#8208;responsive EPR studies and various chemical scavenging experiments.

         <dc:description>
This work describes a remarkable reactivity of N,C,N&#8208;coordinated stibinidene and arsinidene that includes oxidative addition, tautomerization and reductive elimination steps that are allowed via so&#8208;called element ligand cooperation. The whole reaction sequence is studied form both experimental and theoretical point of view.







Abstract
The treatment of pnictinidenes [2&#8208;(RNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(RN=CH)C6H3]E (1As/Sb) (where E=As or Sb) with benzoyl peroxide provided compounds [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O2CPh) (2As/Sb) as a result of two step procedure, i.&#8201;e. oxidation of the pnictogen centre followed by the elimination of benzoic acid. The reaction between 1As and diphenyl disulfide proceeded in the same vein yielding thiophenol and [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]As(SPh) (3As). Analogous reaction of 1Sb furnished a mixture of [2&#8208;(DippNHCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh)2 (3'Sb), [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]Sb(SPh) (3Sb) and PhSH, while NMR studies proved the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between all three compounds in solution and removal of incipient PhSH was necessary for the isolation of 3Sb. Both 1As/Sb smoothly reacted with 2&#8208;nitrosotoluene leading to [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E(O&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8208;Me&#8722;Ph) 4As/Sb and with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione giving [2&#8208;(DippNCH2)&#8208;6&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H3]E[(N(CO)&#8208;NH(CO))N&#8722;Ph] 5As/Sb. All compounds were characterized by IR, Raman, NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular structures, except for 3As and 5Sb, were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, we scrutinized the thermally induced reductive elimination of benzoic acid and thiophenol from 2&#8211;3As/Sb, respectively, and that of 4&#8208;phenylurazole from 5As. These eliminations involve C&#8722;H activation at the CH2N group, and the recovery of the pnictinidene center in [2,6&#8208;(RN=CH)2C6H3]E (6As/Sb). Using DFT calculations a plausible mechanism was suggested for all the investigated reactions, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations.

         <title>Multigram Scale Synthesis of Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked Derivatives of SWNT using Mechanochemical Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We can make mechanically interlocked derivatives of SWNTs (MINTs) using mechanochemistry in multigram scale. The synthesis is super&#8208;fast, requires minimal amounts of solvent and works with both (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and larger and cheaper TuballTM tubes. With this method, it becomes feasible to use MINTs in real&#8208;world applications, like the reinforcement of polymers.







Abstract
The grinding of chemical reagents enables mixing, promotes molecular collisions, and provides the thermal energy required for chemical reactions, while reducing the need for solvent (often to none) and significantly speeding up reactions. This has made mechanochemistry a powerful alternative to traditional solution chemistry. Here, we show that mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) can be made via mechanochemistry in a multigram scale. Compared to the previously reported method in suspension, mechanochemistry allows us to reduce the amount of solvent by two orders of magnitude and the reaction time from 72&#8197;h to 5&#8197;min. The mechanochemical synthesis of MINTs is proven to work both with purified (6,5)&#8208;SWNTs and affordable TuballTM SWNTs, enabling the cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly multigram scale synthesis of MINTs. With this new synthetic methodology, we open the door to the real&#8208;world applications of MINTs in fields such as polymer composites.

         <title>Functionalized Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene</title>

A mixed &#8208;ligand strategy was adopted to constructed a series of isomorphic Th&#8208;MOFs (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) using porphyrin ligands and 2, 2&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5, 5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2bpydc). These catalysts have photosensitive units and Th6 clusters, and were applied to investigated photocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP, and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5&#8208;DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th6&#8208;TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th6&#8208;TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95&#8201;% for 9, 10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5&#8201;% for 1, 5&#8208;DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.

         <title>Conjugation Effects in the Generation of Dynamic Covalent Libraries of Bis&#8208;Imines from Substituted Aromatic Aldehyde and Amine Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic conjugation in reactants influences the generation, selectivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines; a cross bis&#8208;imine (A1B1A2) preferentially forms over homologous bis&#8208;imines (A1B1A1 and A2B1A2) in a multi&#8208;component system generating dynamic covalent imine libraries.







Abstract
The conjugation&#8208;driven stability and reactivity of bis&#8208;imine formation from the reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes and amines bearing electron donor and acceptor groups were studied in two approaches involving aldehydes and amines with the substituents either conjugated (para position) or non&#8208;conjugated (meta position) to the reacting functional groups. The bis&#8208;imine from the reaction of a bis&#8208;amine (B) with different types of aldehydes (A) constituted an ABA module, whereas the reaction of bis&#8208;aldehydes with different amines resulted in a BAB module. The competitive reactions were also studied for a specified bis&#8208;amine (B1 or B2) in similar conditions with a mixture of different aldehydes, and the time&#8208;dependent generations of dynamic covalent libraries were followed. The results indicated that conjugation modulated the bis&#8208;imine formation. The reaction of the conjugated bis&#8208;amine B1 with a mixture of two different aldehydes A1 and A2 favoured the formation of the bis&#8208;imine A1B1A2 involving different aldehydes. The results of the study provide insights into the effect of conjugation on the reactivity and stability of bis&#8208;imines and provide a basis for inducing selectivity features in the formation of bis&#8208;imines from different types of aldehyde and amine groups. They provide an entry into the design of dynamic covalent libraries generated from extended multicomponent systems.

         <title>Sulfide Synthesis via A Bioinspired C&#8722;S &#963;&#8208;Bond Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised and realized a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols with thioethers. This reaction is promoted by a mixture of commonly used Lewis acids and allows fast access to various challenging thioethers from easily available ones by directly editing one alkyl group of the thioether with easily available alcohols as the new alkyl group. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle.







Abstract
In this manuscript, inspired by the natural S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle, we devised a mixed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of organic sulfides with the C&#8722;O bond of alcohols. This reaction is mediated by a readily available and operationally facile mixture of AlCl3 and ZnI2, which allows fast access to various challenging organic sulfides by directly editing the (sp3)C&#8722;S bond of easily available ones. Like multiple bond metathesis, this method could also be rendered intramolecular and extended to ether (sp3)C&#8722;O bond metathesis as well as amine (sp3)C&#8722;N bond metathesis to provide saturated heterocycles such as cyclic thioethers, cyclic ethers, as well as cyclic amines. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to show a high level of resemblance to the natural SAM cycle. We anticipate this bioinspired design of C&#8722;S/C&#8722;O metathesis will infuse the area of a &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis with more insights and provide opportunities for further advances in areas that have been facilitated by traditional C&#8722;X bond forming reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Derivatives of the Antibiotic Albicidin: The N&#8208;Terminal Fragment as Key to Control Potency and Resistance Mediated by the Binding Protein AlbA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript gives a deep inside in the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the N&#8208;terminal fragment of the antibiotic albicidin. This study uncovered a new structure scaffold comprising bicyclic aromatics as replacement for albicidin's methyl coumaric acid. Such variations enable the control of the resistance factor AlbA while maintaining excellent antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The peptide albicidin represents a highly promising lead structure which is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class antibiotic with remarkable potency against gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Past efforts in the synthesis of albicidin analogs focused on increasing hydrophilicity, broadening of the antibacterial profile and overcoming resistance. Herein, we present synthetic albicidin derivatives with variations in the N&#8208;terminal building block and characterize their antibacterial activity and DNA gyrase inhibition. Furthermore, we show that the N&#8208;terminus of albicidin greatly affects binding to the resistance factor AlbAL. This transcription regulator senses albicidin and triggers the biosynthesis of the binding protein AlbAS, thus reducing the free concentration of the antibiotic. Here we demonstrate uncoupling of the binding event from transcription activation for some derivatives, and even a few derivatives seemed insensitive to sequestration by AlbA. This approach could be a strategy to develop albicidin analogs escaping AlbA resistance.

Dimerization of the boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate complex provides valuable functional luminescence properties, like solvatochromism, mechanochromism and phosphorescence, which are absent in the parent single molecule. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that delicately balanced intramolecular electronic interactions should impart the specific excited state characteristics leading to those luminescent behaviors.







Abstract
We report synthesis and optical properties of the dimers of boron &#946;&#8208;dialdiminate (DAI) complexes with different connection manners. The series of dimers, o&#8208;, m&#8208;, p&#8208; and d&#8208;BisDAI, were prepared, and their photophysical properties were compared with the single unit, DAI. It was found that the dimers show characteristic optical properties: o&#8208;BisDAI showed bathochromic shifts in absorption and emission spectra and emission quenching because of the through&#8208;space interactions, while the photophysical properties of m&#8208;BisDAI and DAI were almost identical. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation in p&#8208;BisDAI could induce not only the bathochromic shifts of its absorption and emission bands but also the solvatochromism originating from the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer character. d&#8208;BisDAI showed the weak low&#8208;energy emission in solution and the mechanochromic luminescence which might stem from the rotational degree of freedom between the adjacent two DAI units.

         <title>Simultaneous Construction of Axial and Central Stereogenicity by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent Reductive Coupling of Heterobiaryl Triflates and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl core, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoconvergent coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available chiral cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.

         <title>Regulating the Ligand N&#8208;Heterocyclic Coordination in Bismuth&#8208;Based MOFs for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.







Abstract
The increasing global concern over environmental degradation and resource depletion has driven the search for sustainable technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions. Recently, bismuth&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (Bi&#8208;MOFs) have garnered significant attention due to their high stability, adjustable porosity, and excellent light absorption properties. However, weak visible light absorption and charge recombination are still obstacles to wide application. In this study, a new class of Bi&#8208;MOFs based on tribenzoic acid with different ligand N&#8208;atom number was synthesized by solvothermal method. Experimental and computational results indicated that the introduction of one N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridine group within the ligand led to an enhanced localized internal electric field (LIEF), which could promote efficient charge separation and enhance the interaction with CO2 molecules, thus improving photocatalytic activity. This study highlights the potential of pyridine&#8208;functionalized ligands for the design of high&#8208;performance MOFs for CO2 reduction, providing valuable insights for the development of advanced materials in environmental sustainability efforts.

         <title>Development of Diverse Ligands and Catalysts Derived from Axially Chiral Cyclic Biphenyldiols</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral CYCNOLs have been developed. The variation of substituent groups at 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions afforded diverse ligands and catalysts. The precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites including variation of substituent groups at 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions and ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions, realized the high reactivity and stereoselectivity in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The development of suitable chiral ligands and catalysts is a key factor in asymmetric organic synthesis. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of a new kind of adjustable axially chiral cyclic biphenyl ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols, and four representative examples were performed well including enantioselective alkynylation of benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazine 2,2&#8208;dioxide under catalysis of (R)&#8208;cyclic [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol/ZnMe2, palladium&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cycloaddition of 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolan&#8208;2&#8208;one with 2&#8208;arylidenemalononitriles in the presence of axially chiral cyclic phosphoramidite ligand, and axially chiral cyclic phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of styryl&#8208;1H&#8208;indole with cyclic 2,4&#8208;dienones and asymmetric Michael addition of indolizine to cyclopentenediones. The experiments showed that variation of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;substituent groups could provide different kinds of axially chiral cyclic ligands and catalysts, variation of steric and electronic properties (by changing substituent groups at the 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;positions) and dihedral angles (by changing ring sizes at 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions) could greatly change catalytic efficiency of ligands and catalysts derived from axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols. The high reactivity and stereoselectivity of the reactions were effectively achieved through the precise regulation of multi&#8208;sites on our axially chiral cyclic biphenyldiols.

         <title>A Luminescent Stable Triarylmethyl Diradical with an Axially Chiral Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel boronic ester radical precursor, two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical were bridged with an axially chiral spacer for the first time. The resulting, diradical (R/S)&#8208;1 demonstrated high stability in solution under ambient conditions and exhibited a photoluminescence quantum yield of 10&#8201;%, along with circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chloroform.







Abstract
Two units of a highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged using a chiral octahydrobinaphthyl moiety, resulting in a diradical with sufficient stability to enable the measurement of its chiroptical properties. To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H&#8208;PyBTM&#8208;B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical&#8208;substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10&#8201;% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.

To synthesize this diradical, a novel boronic ester radical precursor, &#945;H-PyBTM-B(Epin), was designed. The use of this precursor significantly improved the yield and streamlined the preparation of stable luminescent radical-substituted molecules. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diradical was measured to be 10&#8201;% in chloroform. Furthermore, both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were successfully observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Global Spectral Analysis of Polaritonic Coupling of Multiple Organic Dyes to a Tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Resonator Operating with Mirror Separations up to 10&#8197;&#956;m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate simultaneous strong coupling of two different J&#8208;aggregated dyes embedded in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator at mirror distances exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;m. The observed polariton modes can be modeled by a phenomenological Hamiltonian. Even at very large distances, there are hybrid polaritons present, which contain contributions from both dye molecules, making this system a promising platform for studying polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer.







Abstract
We study strong optical coupling and the formation of hybrid polaritons by a donor&#8208;acceptor pair of J&#8208;aggregated dyes separated by up to 11&#8197;&#956;m in a tunable Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonator. Fitting a phenomenological Hamiltonian to the white light transmission spectra of different cavity&#8208;J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;configurations, for which several hundred spectra were recorded sequentially as function of cavity length, allows us to determine coupling energies as a function of the effective cavity distances. The theoretical analysis shows that certain hybrid polaritons contain contributions from both dyes, making this system a promising platform for polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer at very large distances.

         <title>New Cytotoxic Derivatives by the Phosphorylation and Phosphinoylation of Diethyl &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Methylphosphonates</title>

In order to make available potentionally bioactive new &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were phosphorylated, phosphinoylated and thiophosphinoylated with the corresponding P&#8208;chloride. The effect of a P=O to P=S modification was evaluated by single crystal X&#8208;ray cristallography. Among the phosphorylated and phosphinoylated aminophosphonates a few derivatives revealed moderate cytotoxic effect.







Abstract
In order to make available new derivatives, diethyl &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;methylphosphonates were subjected to phosphorylation, phosphinoylation and even thiophosphinoylation by reaction with phosphoryl chlorides, diphenylphosphinoyl chloride, and with the mixture of diphenylchlorophosphine and elemental sulfur, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the diphenylphosphinoyl and the diphenylthiophosphinoyl derivatives revealed molecular and supramolecular similarities, as well as a few differences too. An essential conformation change, along with packing differences are attributable to a change of one heteroatom: an oxygen for a sulfur in one of the P=X function. The diethyl diethylphosphoryl&#8208;aminobenzylphosphonates showed the highest antiproliferative effects on multiple myeloma cells, while the thiophosphinoylated diethyl aminobenzylphosphonate was the most effective on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.

         <title>Adaptive Coordination Behavior of Bisphosphanylphosphanido&#8208;Ligands Toward Group 2, 11 and 12 Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of 2, 11 and 12 metal ions with a bisphosphanylphosphanide counter anion affords versatile and adaptive coordination motifs, for which NMR parameters (1JPP) serve as an easy and reliable diagnostic tool consistent with the situation in solid state as corroborated by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
A series of alkaline earth metal complexes (Mg&#8722;Ba) with the anionic ferrocenylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphanylphosphanide ligand [Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2P]&#8722; has been prepared by metalation of the corresponding bisphosphanylhydrophosphane (Fe(C5H4PC4H9)2PH). The resulting complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and SC&#8208;XRD. Furthermore, the closely related zinc phosphanide, and rare, mononuclear coinage metal phosphanides were synthesized and investigated for comparison. The range of coordination modes observed for the phosphanide ligand included mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and tridentate modi and their respective combinations, whereas no &#956;2&#8208;bridging of the phosphanide center has been observed. The value of the 1JPP coupling constant was found to be a good probe to track the coordination motif consistent with the situation in solid state.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (BHAS) Reactions and Hydrodehalogenations Driven by Green Light and an Iron(III)&#8208;NHC Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present the application of an Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex in the intramolecular base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution reaction. Milder reaction conditions than previously reported were employed, which tolerated functional groups like an aldehyde and ester. The reaction leads to the predominant formation of the cyclized product (CP) over the hydrodehalogenated product (HP). A mechanism is proposed, supported by extensive mechanistic studies.







Abstract
An Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex has been employed for the green light driven catalysis of base&#8208;promoted homolytic aromatic substitution (BHAS) reactions. Tributylamine was used as a sacrificial electron donor, together with potassium carbonate as base in dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. In contrast to previously studied photocatalysts, the excited Fe(III)&#8208;NHC complex is not reducing the arylhalide substrates. Instead, the latter are activated by &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals formed upon reductive quenching of the photocatalyst by tributylamine. Avoiding strongly reducing photocatalysts as well as strong base, these mild reaction conditions allowed for the expansion of the substrate scope to accommodate also aldehyde and ester substituents. 100&#8201;% conversion was obtained after 48&#8197;h of irradiation. In this way a wide variety of cyclized products and their corresponding hydrodehalogenated products were obtained as isolated and pure compounds, in the vast majority of cases.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we described a novel [1+1+1] deoxygenative cyclopropanation between sulfur ylides and aldehydes, which is distinctive from traditional epoxidation reactions. The method offers a straightforward approach for the synthesis of highly stereoselective, functionalized, and structurally diverse tertiary cyclopropyl thioethers. The reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and excellent compatibility with various functional groups, rendering it particularly suitable for the late&#8208;stage modifications of pharmaceuticals and natural products, as well as the synthesis of structurally diverse compounds. Additionally, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enals can also engage in the deoxygenative cyclopropanation reaction, instead of undergoing classic cyclopropanation through a Michael addition reaction&#8208;induced cyclization with sulfur ylides, thus yielding synthetically important vinylcyclopropanes with excellent chemoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Confined Structural Water Molecules as Alternative Potential Emitters for Bright Photoluminescence of Thiolate&#8208;Gold Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, structural water molecules can form an interface electronic state with &#960;&#8208;bonding properties due to the spatial interaction of the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms at the nanoscale, thus acting as emitters for the bright photoluminescence of thiolate&#8208;gold complexes.







Abstract
The debate about water as an emitter has spanned nearly a century, but how it emits bright colors remains elusive. In this report, using the widely used Au(I)&#8208;alkanethiolate complex (Au(I)&#8208;SRs, R=&#8722;(CH2)12H) with AIE properties as a model system, by carefully manipulating the delicate surface&#8208;ligand interactions at the nanoscale interface, together with a careful spectral investigation and an isotopic diagnostic experiment of heavy water (D2O), we demonstrated that the structural water molecules (SWs) trapped in the nanoscale interface or space are the true emission centers of metal nanoclusters (NCs) and the aggregates of Au(I)&#8208;SRs complexes, instead of a well&#8208;organized metal core dominated by quantum confinement mechanics. Unlike conventional hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules, due to interfacial adsorption or spatial confinement, the p&#8208;orbitals of two O atoms in SWs can form strong electronic interactions through spatial overlap, thus constructing a set of interfacial states, one of which is characterized by &#960;&#8208;bonding, thus providing alternative channels (or paths) for the relaxation decay of the excited electrons. Using the one&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;electron gas model, the energy levels calculated by the Schr&#246;dinger equation are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations, further validating the SWs model.

         <title>Design and Properties of Azaacene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Extending &#960;&#8208;Systems for NIR&#8208;II Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we provide the straightforward synthesis of new azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins, accompanied by an in&#8208;depth investigation of their optical and electrochemical properties. These experimental findings were further supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations, providing valuable insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of porphyrins featuring various azaacene moieties were designed with the aim to explore the structure&#8211;property relationships in extended azaacene systems. The introduction of azaacene groups significantly enhanced the solubility of these chromophores while directly influencing their electronic absorption and emission properties, enabling absorption at longer wavelengths. Protonation of the azaacene&#8208;fused porphyrins further extended their absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The &#960; system extension provided by the new appended diamino aromatic groups were therefore investigated through electrochemical, photophysical, X&#8208;ray diffraction structural studies and complemented by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Rapid Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study of Medium&#8208;Sized Cyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient methodology for the synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy was developed. A variety of linear peptides with C&#8208;terminal diversity were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and epimerization&#8208;suppressed fragment coupling. The resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides.







Abstract
Medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides are expected to be ideal drug leads because these peptides combine the advantages, while compensating for the disadvantages, of small molecules and antibodies. Although medium&#8208;sized peptides can be produced by chemical synthesis, two major problems, namely (i) C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during C&#8208;terminal modification and (ii) side reactions in the cyclization, remain to be solved. These issues have hampered the synthesis of pure materials for bioassays, making it difficult to accomplish accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides based on the twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation strategy. First, a variety of linear peptides were synthesized by the &#8220;inverse&#8221; peptide synthesis and fragment coupling. Second, the C&#8208;terminus of the linear peptides were converted to twisted amides, which were then reacted with a variety of &#945;&#8208;amino acyl sulfonamides, realizing the rapid C&#8208;terminal diversification of peptides. Finally, the resulting linear peptides were cyclized by the intramolecular twisted amide&#8208;mediated amidation to afford stereochemically pure cyclic peptides. Using this strategy, total synthesis of acyl&#8208;surugamide A, the stereoselective synthesis of 13 non&#8208;natural analogs, and the discovery of potent antimicrobial/antifungal peptides beyond the natural product were also achieved.

The hand you are dealt: Reduced TcV/ReVI octahedra and fully oxidized TcVII/ReVII tetrahedra self&#8208;assemble, mix and match, and exchange to produce the first group&#8197;VII technetium/rhenium mixed metal polyoxometalate and the first rigorous characterization of a rhenium autoreduction product. Based on both the lability of the polynuclear clusters and trends in reduction, the expansion of nascent group&#8197;VII polyoxometalates is promising.

         <title>4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Radical Cyclization: A Promising Approach to Four&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 21, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization is an attractive method for direct construction of synthetically important but challenging four&#8208;membered rings. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in this field over the past 20&#8197;years, including processes enabled by SmI2, n&#8208;Bu3SnH, transition metal catalysis, and photocatalyst, respectively, with an emphasis on the analysis of reaction mechanism and selectivity control.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization represents a formidable challenge owing to the unfavorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of highly strained four&#8208;membered rings. Stimulated by the explosive advancements of radical chemistry over the past decades, significant progresses have been made in this area, including the SmI2&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbonyl&#8208;alkene cyclization, n&#8208;Bu3SnH&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;exo cyclization of functionalized alkenes or alkynes, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closures, and visible light&#8208;induced 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade, providing efficient protocols to overcome the inherent limitations and expand the synthetic utility of this methodology. Representative examples, reaction mechanism, scope and limitations, and synthetic applications are presented and discussed in detail. We believe that the systematic review of recent advances on 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization will provide more insights in this field, and may enable further development of this cyclization process for the concise synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles that are difficult to access via traditional methods.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Metallo&#8208;Supergels of Folic Acid: Potential Sustainable Gelator for Oilfield Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In combination with a large group of various metal salts folic acid (FA) forms mechanically robust metallogels with rapid recovery and self&#8208;healing properties. These versatile gel systems provide tunable stiffness, with up to 95% of stiffness restored within 1 min. Our work sheds light on FA as a high potential and universal gelator that is a relatively cheap and sustainable building block for soft materials with practical applications.








Abstract
The majority of known metallosupramolecular gels are based on carefully designed ligands using extensive chemical synthesis. Their gelation is often limited to a certain specific metal salt. We demonstrate that in the presence of a wide group of metal salts natural and readily available folic acid (FA) can act as a supergelator. We report a systematic investigation of 17 mechanically robust FA&#8208;based metallogels at extremely low concentrations (&lt;0.2 wt%). Using oscillatory rheological measurements, we further show that these metallogels undergo rapid recovery and self&#8208;healing, recovering up to 95% of their original stiffness within 1 min.

     alt="Robust Self-Healing Metallo-Supergels of Folic Acid: Potential Sustainable Gelator for Oilfield Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In combination with a large group of various metal salts folic acid (FA) forms mechanically robust metallogels with rapid recovery and self-healing properties. These versatile gel systems provide tunable stiffness, with up to 95% of stiffness restored within 1 min. Our work sheds light on FA as a high potential and universal gelator that is a relatively cheap and sustainable building block for soft materials with practical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of known metallosupramolecular gels are based on carefully designed ligands using extensive chemical synthesis. Their gelation is often limited to a certain specific metal salt. We demonstrate that in the presence of a wide group of metal salts natural and readily available folic acid (FA) can act as a supergelator. We report a systematic investigation of 17 mechanically robust FA-based metallogels at extremely low concentrations (&amp;lt;0.2 wt%). Using oscillatory rheological measurements, we further show that these metallogels undergo rapid recovery and self-healing, recovering up to 95% of their original stiffness within 1 min. Among the metallogels studied, FA-chromium(III) acetate gel (0.4 wt%) displayed the highest stiffness with a storage modulus of 4&#160;kPa. More importantly, the stiffness, recovery, and sol&#160;&#8596; gel transitions can be readily tuned by changing either the metal salt or the concentration. Using a combination of various analytical methods, we also suggest a structure of self-assembly in the metallogel network. This study defines non-toxic FA as a robust and sustainable building block for metallogels&#8212;mechanically tunable, multi-responsive soft materials. Finally, as a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate that the FA-chromium(III) acetate gel can be considered as a potent sustainable gellator for enhanced oil recovery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited State Dual Proton Transfer on a &#946;&#8208;Carboline Fluorophore and Its Variable Response to Water and D2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes non&#8208;cascaded excited&#8208;state intramolecular double proton transfer (ESIDPT) in &#946;&#8208;carboline system TrySPy. The experimental and computational investigation suggests that the ESIDPT mechanism involves stepwise proton transfer. The first ESIPT occurs fast and forms the N&#8208;ZPT* form, emitting at &#8764;520&#160;nm. The second ESIPT forms T&#8208;ZPT* and emits &#8764;680&#160;nm. TrySPy can differentiate between water and D2O.








Abstract
The excited state proton transfer (ESPT), a fundamental reaction in chemical and biological systems, is known for its diverse applications. Recent developments in these reactions have examined excited&#8208;state multiple proton transfer (ESMPT) involving two or more protons via inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular mode. This work reports the proton transfer ability of a &#946;&#8208;carboline probe, TrySPy, bearing dual intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The molecule was designed as a hybrid of known fluorophores, TryPy and TrySy, and can be synthesized in one step. Preliminary studies revealed a rigid structure of the compound with increased hydrogen bonding and high relative photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY &#8764; 99). The probe works effectively in the cellular environment and can differentiate between water and D2O by slowing down the proton transfer (PT) process. In water, the fast PT does not allow emission from the enol form (N&#8208;N*), and the emission is observed at 520&#160;nm due to its N&#8208;ZPT* form. However, in D2O, replacing the OH group with OD promotes aggregation of the enol form, with emission at &#8764;450&#160;nm. The mechanistic model proposed for this work relies on the non&#8208;cascaded excited&#8208;state intramolecular double proton transfer (ESIDPT) mechanism. This study expands the scope of the ESIDPT systems in the domain of biologically important fused heterocyclic systems.

         <title>The Role of Lithium Ions on the Solubility of K4E4 in Ethylenediamine and the Oxidation of the Zintl Anions [E4]4&#8208; (E = Ge, Sn, Pb) as well as [Ge9]4&#8208;</title>

         <dc:description>
The solubility of K4Ge4, K4Sn4, and K4Pb4 phases and oxidation of comprised four&#8208;atom clusters in ethylenediamine (en) is induced by the addition of LiCl. The 119Sn NMR spectra of [Sn9]4&#8722; with Li+ and K+ counterions indicate a cation&#8208;dependent change in both the chemical shift and coupling constant, strongly suggesting K+/[Sn9]4&#8722; ion pairing, which is not observed for Li+ counterions.








Abstract
Zintl phases are excellent precursors for nine atom [E9]4&#8722; clusters, which are readily accessible by dissolution of A4E9 phases (A = Na&#8211;Rb; E = Ge&#8211;Pb) in ethylenediamine (en). In contrast, the binary alkali&#8208;metal tetrel phases of composition A4E4 are insoluble in en. Furthermore, Li+&#160;cations are rarely investigated as counterions for tetrel element Zintl clusters. We report here that K4E4, comprising [E4]4&#8722; polyanions (E = Ge, Sn, and Pb), which are insoluble in en, readily dissolves in en in the presence of lithium ions and the four atomic polyanions [E4]4&#8722; are oxidized to nine&#8208;atom [E9]4&#8722; clusters during dissolution. We isolated crystals of [Li(en)2.5]4[Ge9] and [Li(en)2]4[E9] (E = Sn and Pb) with exclusively Li counterions. Furthermore, the alkali&#8208;metal ion exchange of K4Ge9 with LiCl in en results also in the oxidation of [Ge9]4&#8722; to [Ge9&#8208;Ge9]6&#8722; dimers which were isolated as partially and fully ion&#8208;exchanged salts such as K2[Li(en)2]4[Ge9&#8208;Ge9] and [Li(en)2]6.5[Ge9&#8208;Ge9], respectively. NMR spectroscopic investigations of solutions of [Sn9]4&#8722; that contain variable Li:K ratio reveal contact K+/[Sn9]4&#8208; ion pairs, while Li+ ions form solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs. The role of Li+ ions on the solubility of Zintl phases and Li+&#160;assisted oxidation of Zintl ions is highlighted.

The synergism of strong and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction enhances the hydrogen evolution performance of Ru nanoclusters anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;support interaction represents an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst consisting of Ru nanoclusters anchored on the N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (abbreviated as Ru@N&#8208;CNS hereafter) with synergistic strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) is developed. Thanks to the equilibrium of SMSI and RMSI, the obtained Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrocatalyst possesses abundant exposed active sites, robust mechanical strength, fast mass transfer, and regulated electronic states, thereby holding outstanding electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance in alkaline medium. To be specific, the Ru@N&#8208;CNS only requires a small overpotential of 16&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of 67.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and highlighted long&#8208;term stability, surpassing the commercial Pt/C and Ru/C. More memorably, a water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer built by the Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrode as cathode and commercial RuO2 as anode needs a low cell voltage of 1.56&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and exhibits excellent stability, reflecting a huge prospect for scalable electrochemical H2 generation. This work opens up a novel thought of synergizing metal&#8208;support interactions for designing progressive electrocatalysts in energy&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Should I stay or should I flow? An exploration of phase&#8208;separated metallosupramolecular liquid crystal polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallosupramolecular liquid crystal polymers (MSLCPs) were synthesized whose architecture and subsequent thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties could be tuned based on the choice of metal salt. These materials displayed high stress relaxation and bulk flow behavior making them prime candidates to study as adhesives. These MSLCP materials displayed robust adhesive character in both the pressure&#8208;sensitive and hot melt adhesive modes






.

Abstract
Dynamic liquid crystalline polymers (dLCPs) incorporate both liquid crystalline mesogens and dynamic bonds into a single polymeric material. These dual functionalities impart order&#8208;dependent thermo&#8208;responsive mechano&#8208;optical properties and enhanced reprocessability/programmability enabling their use as soft actuators, adaptive adhesives, and damping materials. While many previous works studying dynamic LCPs utilize dynamic covalent bonds, metallosupramolecular bonds provide a modular platform where a series of materials can be accessed from a single polymeric feedstock through the variation of the metal ion used. A series of dLCPs were prepared by the addition of metal salts to a telechelic 2,6&#8208;bisbenzimidazolylpyridine (Bip) ligand endcapped LCP to form metallosupramolecular liquid crystal polymers (MSLCPs). The resulting MSLCPs were found to phase separate into hard and soft phases which aids in their mechanical robustness. Variations of the metal salts used to access these materials allowed for control of the thermomechanical, viscoelastic, and adhesive properties with relaxations that can be tailored independently of the mesogenic transition. This work demonstrates that by accessing phase separation through the incorporation of metallosupramolecular moieties, highly processable yet robust MSLCP materials can be realized. This class of materials opens the door to LCPs with bulk flow behavior that can also be utilized as multi&#8208;level adhesives.

         <title>Efficiently Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting over Ni0.85Se&#8208;Ni Foam Electrode Modified with Nanoneedle&#8208;Like Ni3Fe alloy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic splitting of H2O into H2 and O2 is one of the potential ways to develop clean and storable energy. In this study, the self&#8208;supporting Ni0.85Se&#8208;Ni foam (Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF) hybrid electrode was modified with Ni3Fe (Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF) via facile selenization and electrochemical deposition method. The Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF hybrid electrode exhibited excellent performance of electrocatalytic overall water splitting in an alkaline solution (1 M KOH, pH = 13.9), which is much more active than the individual Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF and Ni3Fe/NF. In particular, the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF hybrid electrode generated 10 mA cm&#8208;2 cathodic current at an overpotential of 81 mV, and 10 mA cm&#8208;2 anodic current at an overpotential of 209 mV in KOH solution (1 M, pH = 13.9), respectively. In addition, only 1.68 V potential was required to generate 12 mA cm&#8208;2 current in a two&#8208;electrode system for overall water splitting in an alkaline aqueous solution using the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF working as the anode and cathode, respectively. The TEM images and Raman spectra results indicated that the microstructure reconstruction happened on the surface of the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF electrode after the HER or OER test. Some Ni and Fe species were found to convert to the NixFe1&#8208;xOOH during water electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;Heterocyclic s&#8208;Indacenodifluorene: Synthesis, Properties and Thermally Tunable Ambipolar Field&#8208;Effect Mobility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of semiconducting materials with facile control of charge transport and the nature of charge carriers is essential for realizing niche applications with organic electronics. Described herein are the synthesis, crystal structure, and analysis of the electronic properties of a four&#8208;stage redox amphoteric S&#8208;heterocyclic s&#8208;indacenodifluorene 6, including the study of its ambipolar charge carrier mobility (&#956;h and &#956;e) in organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices. Despite being electron&#8208;rich, our investigation revealed reversible reduction potentials for 6 in the cyclic voltammetry, which is attributed to the recovery of locally aromatic thiophene and cyclopentadienyl anion units upon electron injection for the two antiaromatic S&#8208;heterocyclic as&#8208;indacene units in accordance to the Glidewell&#8208;Lloyd rule of aromaticity. In line with this, we observed an interesting thermal tunability of the nature of charge carriers from p&#8208;type to balanced ambipolar to n&#8208;type charge transport with reasonable semiconductor mobility in all regimes of transport. This behaviour is correlated with the modification of the transport levels upon annealing of the semiconductor and possible increase in the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization with temperature. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept tunability of the nature of charge transport indicates the efficacy of our molecular design.</dc:description>

&#8208;rule&#8221; of Photoactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multistate switches are interesting systems for a plethora of potential applications, such as for data storage involving many different states or for logic operations characterized by specific outputs. The main challenge is to achieve a precise control of accessibility to a specific state via a given sequence of multiple stimuli. Here we have connected dihydroazulene (DHA) and spiropyran (SP) photoswitches in dyads to elucidate differences in optical and switching properties between ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;phenylene bridged dyads. Dyads were prepared by Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions and photoisomerizations studied in detail by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. Moreover, the kinetics of thermal back&#8208;reactions of meta&#8208;stable states were studied. The results show path&#8208;dependent switchings of the dyads using light in combination with other stimuli (acid/base/heat), allowing access to eight distinct states. The accessibility to some specific states via only one sequence of external stimuli provides an additional degree of data storage &#8211; information is not only stored as the state itself but also as the unique sequence of stimuli required to reach this state. By changing the bridging unit between the photoswitches, various properties (outputs) were finely tuned such as absorption and fluorescence behaviors, lifetime of meta&#8208;stable state, and photoisomerization dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts in CO2 Electroreduction Reaction: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in structural reconstruction of Cu based catalyst in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, focusing on mechanism of dynamic reconstruction. It discusses fundamental theories for structural reconstruction, and optimization strategies to enhance CO2RR while suppressing structural reconstruction.








Abstract
The escalating concerns over climate change and environmental pollution have intensified the pursuit for sustainable solutions to mitigate CO2 emissions, with the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) emerging as a promising strategy to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. Central to this process is the development of efficient electrocatalysts, where Cu&#8208;based catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their high activity towards multi&#8208;carbon products. However, understanding of structural reconstruction of Cu&#8208;based catalysts under operational conditions presents a substantial challenge, complicating the identification of real active sites and the elucidation of structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we first highlight the fundamental principles governing the structural reconstruction in CO2RR, encompassing both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. We then introduce advanced Operando techniques employed to monitor the structural changes of catalysts. The review further delves into the dynamic evolution behaviors of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, including atomic rearrangement and morphology evolution, with a focus on correlating these behaviors with catalytic properties such as activity, selectivity, and stability. Finally, we discuss cases of emerging strategies, such as heteroatom doping and electrolyte engineering, that hold promise for manipulating the structural reconstruction of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, and we explore future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Arylpyridylmethylamines via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Coupling of Amines, Aldehydes and Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The arylpyridylmethylamine motif is a privileged scaffold in drug discovery. However, rapidly creating these valuable molecules with structural diversity by directly leveraging readily available, yet simple chemical feedstocks remains a challenge. Herein, we describe a versatile and modular photochemical method for the straightforward construction of arylpyridylmethylamine skeleton utilizing widely accessible starting materials, including amines, aldehydes, and pyridines. This multicomponent coupling proceeds under very mild conditions without the need for any transition&#8208;metal catalysts, photocatalysts, and acid additives and displays a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The potential utility of this methodology in pharmaceutical development is demonstrated through late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, concise synthesis of bioactive compounds, and rapid construction of pyridyl analogue of drug molecules. Combined experimental and computational studies unveiled that this reaction proceeds through radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling between persistent pyridylphosphonium radicals and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Ni Catalysts derived from Phyllosilicates for Synergistically Catalyzing CO2 and CH4 Dry Reforming</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane dry reforming reaction offers an attractive route to simultaneously convert two kinds of greenhouse gases into clean fuels and high valuable chemicals. Nevertheless, the inactivation of nickel&#8208;based catalysts due to sintering and coking in dry reforming has severely limited its industrial application. In this study, we proposed a step&#8208;by&#8208;step strategy to prepare a series of bimetallic xCu&#8208;Ni/SiO2 catalysts derived from phyllosilicate precursors. The optimized catalyst shows exceptional performance, with no deactivation during the 50&#8208;hour stability test, and the CH4 and CO2 conversion were 88.8% and 94.0%, respectively. This was attributed to the synergistic catalysis of Cu&#8208;Ni alloy, effectively inhibits coke formation. Additionally, the distribution of copper species between nickel species inhibited the mobility and enlargement of nickel particles and thus enhanced the resistance to sintering. The preparation strategy offers valuable insights for designing and preparing of highly efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts under high&#8208;temperature conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Chloride&#8208;Binding [2] Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane receptor for chloride containing a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch in the macrocyclic ring can be switched between Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers using 340/385&#160;nm light. This brings about a change in motional dynamics as well as binding affinity. The presented approach is expected to facilitate photocontrolled extractions and transport with high chloride selectivity.








Abstract
Control over the binding properties of anion receptors by external stimuli can be advantageous in various applications such as extraction and transport processes. Toward a light&#8208;responsive anion receptor with high binding affinity and selectivity, a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch is incorporated into the macrocycle of a mechanically interlocked, chloride&#8208;binding [2]rotaxane structure. UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR studies show reversible transformation between Z/E&#8208;isomers upon light irradiation, causing changes in motional dynamics and binding affinity. Photoswitching also takes place in the presence of chloride, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which results in its concomitant uptake and release. Our results show the suitability of rotaxanes as light&#8208;responsive ion receptors, which could serve as prototypes for supramolecular pumps.

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes Supported by a Functionalized PC(sp3)P Pincer Ligand: Properties and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of robust high&#8208;valent organometallic nickel complexes stabilized by a functionalized PC(sp&#179;)P pincer ligand. Notably, the nickel center, covalently confined within the three&#8208;dimensional ligand framework, exhibits predictable coordination and redox behavior, coupled with remarkable stability across oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. These states were found to interconvert via one&#8208;electron transfer reactions. Among these complexes, the Ni(III)&#8208;PC(sp&#179;)P species was identified as an efficient catalyst for the mild and selective hydrosilylation of alkenes, operating through a non&#8208;oxidative mechanism that, in some cases, leads to the formation of vinyl silanes and polysilylated products. We demonstrated that, contrary to a widely accepted concept, high&#8208;valent metals can serve as viable candidates for hydrogenation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step Self&#8208;Assembly of a Double&#8208;Walled Knotted Cage With Increasing Topological Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct intermediates with unique topologies were sequentially formed during the self&#8208;assembly of a double&#8208;walled knotted cage. These topological transformations, which are kinetically forbidden without the reversibility of coordination bonds, allow each intermediate to possess sufficiently long residence times for isolation and enable detailed time&#8208;resolved observation of multistep spontaneous transformations






.

Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly process of a double&#8208;walled cage formed from a semiflexible tripodal ligand and a Pd(II) 90&#8208;degree block was tracked by NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis. At least two intermediate structures with distinct topologies were observed prior to the formation of the final double&#8208;walled cage. By optimizing the self&#8208;assembly conditions (e.g., time, solvent, and concentration), these topological intermediates were successfully isolated and analyzed by x&#8208;ray crystallography. They are considered crucial metastable structures that navigate the shortest pathway to the final structure, demonstrating the critical role of molecular topology in guiding and controlling the kinetics of metal&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the Photochemical Properties of Heterocyclic Hemiindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis enabled the synthesis of a series of 16 novel heterocyclic hemiindigos. From this series, four compounds proved to be very interesting green and red&#8208;light&#8208;responsive hemiindigo photoswitches. The influence of heterocyclic moiety of these compounds on the absorption profiles, stability of isomers, and photoswitching properties are discussed and compared with a theoretical study.








Abstract
This study reports a series of novel heterocyclic hemiindigos (Het&#8208;HI) synthesized via the condensation of indoxyl acetate with various heteroaromatic aldehydes. The influence of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles on the photochemical and photophysical properties of these compounds has been investigated. Our findings reveal that several Het&#8208;HIs exhibit noteworthy photoswitching behavior, including enhanced absorption at the visible region. Notably, certain derivatives respond efficiently to green and red light, achieving good conversions to the metastable E&#8208;isomer and displaying prolonged half&#8208;lives of up to 53 days in a polar solvent. The results highlight the potential of these photoswitches for applications in molecular devices and responsive materials.

         <title>Chemical Evolution of Early Macromolecules: From Prebiotic Oligopeptides to Self&#8208;Organizing Biosystems via Amyloid Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short amyloidogenic oligopeptides (APRs) are proposed as early macromolecules capable of forming solvent&#8208;separated nanosystems under prebiotic conditions. This study provides experimental evidence that APRs, such as the aggregation&#8208;prone oligopeptide A (APR&#8208;A), can undergo mutational transitions to form distinct variants, and convert to APR&#8208;B, either amyloid&#8208;like or water&#8208;soluble and non&#8208;aggregating. These transitions occur along a spectrum from strongly amyloidogenic (pro&#8208;amyloid) to weakly amyloidogenic (anti&#8208;amyloid), with the mutation sequence order playing a key role in determining their physicochemical properties. The pro&#8208;amyloid pathway facilitates heterogeneous phase separation, leading to amyloid&#8208;crystal formation with multiple polymorphs, including the first class 3 amyloid topology. By mapping these transitions, we demonstrate the potential co&#8208;evolution of water&#8208;soluble miniproteins and insoluble amyloids, both of which could have been pivotal in early bio&#8208;nanosystem formation. These insights into amyloid modulation provide a crucial step toward understanding amyloid control mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Ir(III) complexes, [Ir(C^N)2(en)]+ (where C^N = 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzo[d]thiazolyl cyclometalating ligand; en = ethylene diamine), are reported with structural variation via a substituent (H, Me, OMe, Cl, OCF3) at the coordinated phenyl ring. &#160;The complexes were soluble in aqueous buffer, with solubility limits correlating inversely with the predicted logP. The complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8208;500 nm (e ~ 5000 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1) due to charge&#8208;transfer transitions and are triplet emitters in aerated buffer (lem = 529&#8208;540 nm; lifetimes up to 0.763 ms; Fem &#163; 12 %). Each complex was investigated, via computational and biophysical experiments, in the context of DNA binding. According to UV&#8208;visible titrations, the cationic complexes bind to DNA with apparent affinities ranging from 6&#180;104 to 5&#180;105 M&#8208;1 with apparent binding site sizes between 0.4 and 1.0 base pairs.Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that complexes [Ir(L1&#8208;3)2(en)]Cl bind to DNA in two types of binding sites, viz. a high affinity (107&#8208;108 M&#8208;1) binding site with characteristics of major groove binding and a low affinity binding site (105 M&#8208;1)&#160; with characteristics of non&#8208;specific binding to negatively charged DNA, with binding supported by hydrophobic interactions between complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Protein Engineering: Backbone Cyclization Rescues Folding of a 183&#8208;Residue Truncated Domain of Malaria Parasite Protein PfAMA1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) and rhoptry neck protein 2 (PfRON2) is crucial for Plasmodium falciparum red blood cell invasion, making it a key target for anti&#8208;malarial drug development strategies. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of PfAMA1 domain&#8208;I (PfAMA1&#8208;DI) in both linear and backbone&#8208;circularized forms, employing a six&#8208;segment convergent synthesis approach exploiting one&#8208;pot chemistries and solubilizing tags. The chemically synthesized linear PfAMA1&#8208;DI construct exhibited incomplete disulfide bond formation during folding, likely due to increased terminal flexibility in the absence of domain&#8208;II. To address this, we employed backbone cyclization of the large 180&#8208;residue polypeptide chain, with 3&#8208;residue linker sequence, as a unique strategy to conformationally restrict its termini and facilitate correct disulfide bond formation. Introducing a multipurpose affinity and solubility tag to the cyclicPfAMA1&#8208;DI construct further improved the folding yield by mitigating aggregation. The predicted structure using ColabFold&#8208;Alphafold2 indicated that PfRON2 ligand binds within the hydrophobic groove of the cyclicPfAMA1&#8208;DI construct similar to the native interactions. These findings underscore the potential of large protein backbone cyclization to stabilize protein structure, offering a compelling strategy for the chemical synthesis of otherwise unstable protein domains with broad applications in miniature protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts are vital for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides due to their&#160;Lewis acidic sites. This concept provides a concise perspective on the advancements of single&#8208;atom catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition reactions, focusing on the mechanism and catalytic driven forces.

Abstract
The conversion of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic carbonates represents a promising strategy for CO2 utilization and valorization, with applications spanning pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymer manufacturing, and energy storage. This concept article provides a concise perspective on the advancements in CO2 cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), encompassing photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and photothermal catalysis. Despite significant progress in the field, challenges such as limited catalytic activity and low stability of SACs under reaction conditions remain significant obstacles to industrial implementation. Mechanistic insights into active species are emphasized to enable the rational design and optimization of catalytic systems. In addition, key industrial challenges, such as the elimination of co&#8208;catalysts, scalability limitations, and the development of cost&#8208;effective production methods, are critically examined. By bridging fundamental research and practical applications, this concept article seeks to guide future advancements in the sustainable production of cyclic carbonates through CO2 cycloaddition.

         <title>Photochemical Homologated Aminophosphorylation of Carbon&#8208;Carbon &#960;&#8208;, and &#963;&#8208;Bonds through Radical Translocation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Difunctionalization of olefins serves as the workhorse for rapid creation of molecular complexity from simple feedstocks. However, these reactions are mostly restricted to the 1,2&#8208;variant, with higher homologations being attempted to a much lesser extent. Radical translocation strategies serve as an escape from the traditional 1,2&#8208;strategies, providing a means for achieving distant functionalizations that are otherwise difficult to access. Herein, we disclose visible light&#8208;mediated strategies for the accessing of 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, 1,5&#8208;, and 1,6&#8208;aminophosphonates via combination of various radical shifting methods. In addition, the aminophosphorylation of &#963;&#8208;bonds was also achieved, leading to 1,3&#8208;aminophosphorylated cyclobutanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense Li deposition and enhanced flame&#8208;retardant enabled by localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrolled lithium (Li) deposition can lead to the formation of dendrites and "dead" Li, accelerating the degradation of cycling stability and safety performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve dense Li deposition and flame&#8208;retardant by designing an electrolyte based on localized strong ion&#8208;dipole (LSID) interactions. The strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions between the multiple&#8208;dipole solvent (G4), NO3&#8208;, FSI&#8208; and Li+ promote the formation of Li+ primary solvation sheaths for stabilizing Li deposition behavior. While the weak dipole fluorine&#8208;containing diluent (TTE) is distributed in the secondary solvation sheath due to weak ion&#8208;dipole interactions of Li+&#8208;TTE to improve interfacial wettability and flame retardancy due to preferential separation. Consequently, the localized strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions strategy in the designed electrolyte successfully achieves a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% for Li||Cu cells, and ultrathin Li&#8208;matched Li||LFP and Li||NCM523 cells also demonstrate excellent cycling stability, as well as an improved safety performance of LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>TiNiSi&#8208;Type ALiAu (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) Compounds: Alternative Use of &#8220;Excess&#8221; Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excess electrons distinguish the bonding in ALiAu (A = Yb, Ca, Eu, Sr, Ba), a new series of intermetallic compounds crystallizing in TiNiSi type. According to bonding analysis, these metallic phases are classified as aurides containing polycations with multiatomic bonding between A, Li, and Au






.

Abstract
New TiNiSi&#8208;type compounds ALiAu (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) were obtained in the form of mm&#8208;sized single crystals by high&#8208;temperature centrifugation&#8208;aided filtration from lithium melt. They are the first examples of TiNiSi&#8208;type representatives containing Li and a transition metal. The metallic phases show paramagnetic (Ca) or diamagnetic (Sr, Ba, Yb) behavior or antiferromagnetic ordering below 19 K (Eu). A new structural description is based on a hexagonal close packing with A occupying all octahedral and Li occupying half of the tetrahedral voids in an ordered fashion. Chemical bonding analysis supports the structural description and reveals the formation of eight&#8208;atomic stella&#8211;quadrangula bonds pinned on the empty tetrahedral holes, a bonding picture known from elemental metals.

         <title>The Dinuclear Zirconocene Complex [(Cp2Zr)2(&#956;&#8208;Me)(&#956;&#8208;C2Ph)] as a Platform for Small Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported dinuclear zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex represents a multifaceted platform for the activation of small molecules. While reduction reactions furnish unusual di&#8208; and trinuclear hydride complexes, reactions with nitriles result in coordination and reduction of the substrate. Detailed structural and computational analysis gives insights into the structure and bonding of these species.








Abstract
The dinuclear title compound [(Cp2Zr)2(&#956;&#8208;Me)(&#956;&#8208;C2Ph)] 5 was prepared from a zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex and Rosenthal's zirconocene source [Cp2Zr(py)(&#951;2&#8208;Me3SiC2SiMe3)] in a formal comproportionation reaction. This complex shows catalytic activity for the dehydrocoupling of amine boranes, with a dinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged alkynyl complex 6 being formed as a catalytically relevant species. The structure of this complex was confirmed for the first time by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The reaction of complex 5 with hydrogen results in hydrogenation of the alkynyl ligand, yielding a highly labile trinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged complex as a possible intermediate of zirconocene dihydride/ethylbenzene formation. This complex shows an unusual distorted planar tetracoordinate environment at the central carbon atom positioned between the three Zr centers. The reaction of complex 5 with 2&#8208;cyanopyridine and acetonitrile is characterized by a reduction of the substrates. The herein reported reactivity of complex 5 demonstrates the remarkable potential of well&#8208;established dinuclear zirconocenes to stabilize unusual bond situations, which were analyzed comprehensively using spectroscopic, structural, and computational methods.

         <title>Modulation of Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Cu(I) Alkynyl Clusters by Carboxylic Acid Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inclusion of carboxylic acid ligands significantly impacts the structural arrangement of the metal core in Cu(I) alkynyl clusters, thereby affecting their fluorescence properties. Furthermore, the incorporation of ferrocene into these clusters has been noted to induce modifications in the electrochemical performance of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters.








Abstract
Surface ligands play a pivotal role in the functional design of atomically precise Cu(I) nanoclusters. They act as protective agents, ensuring the stability of the Cu(I) clusters, while also influencing their structure and properties. This study delves into the synthesis, structure, and properties of innovative Cu(I) nanoclusters co&#8208;stabilized by carboxylic acid and alkynyl ligands. The findings reveal that these surface ligands wield a significant impact on the cluster's structure and can even modulate the luminescent characteristics of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters. Moreover, density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on how different carboxylic acid ligands affect the UV&#8208;visible absorptivity of paired Cu(I) clusters. In addition, ferrocene carboxylic acids were employed as protective ligands to impart electrochemical properties to the Cu(I) clusters.

     alt="Modulation of Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Cu(I) Alkynyl Clusters by Carboxylic Acid Ligands"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of carboxylic acid ligands significantly impacts the structural arrangement of the metal core in Cu(I) alkynyl clusters, thereby affecting their fluorescence properties. Furthermore, the incorporation of ferrocene into these clusters has been noted to induce modifications in the electrochemical performance of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface ligands play a pivotal role in the functional design of atomically precise Cu(I) nanoclusters. They act as protective agents, ensuring the stability of the Cu(I) clusters, while also influencing their structure and properties. This study delves into the synthesis, structure, and properties of innovative Cu(I) nanoclusters co-stabilized by carboxylic acid and alkynyl ligands. The findings reveal that these surface ligands wield a significant impact on the cluster's structure and can even modulate the luminescent characteristics of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters. Moreover, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on how different carboxylic acid ligands affect the UV-visible absorptivity of paired Cu(I) clusters. In addition, ferrocene carboxylic acids were employed as protective ligands to impart electrochemical properties to the Cu(I) clusters. This research presents an effective methodology for synthesizing atomically precise Cu(I) clusters shielded by carboxylic acid ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Matter Through Crystal Engineering: Covalent Bond Formation to Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry can transform organic synthesis by revealing that crystalline materials are not static but rather dynamic environments for controlled covalent bond formations and manipulations. This review focuses on how supramolecular chemistry can be developed to direct molecular synthesis in the organic solid state, directing reliable C&#8208;C bond formations to enable transformations difficult or impossible in solution. Special attention is given to post&#8208;synthetic modifications that serve to broaden the functional scope of solid&#8208;state reactivity allowing organic crystals to be developed as molecular flasks and a form of supramolecular matter.

         <title>Multifunctional Alternating Copolymer Nanoflower Iodine Hosts for Long&#8208;Term Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries are considered to be potential energy storage systems due to their safety, environmental friendliness and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the shuttle effect of polyiodide leads to cathode active mass loss and anode Zn corrosion, which greatly reduces the cycle life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. Herein, we report an N&#8208;modified alternating copolymer nanoflower composite (NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA) as a new type of iodine host candidate to effectively inhibit the polyiodide shuttle effect in Zn&#8208;I2 battery. As a result, the NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA/I2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I2 battery demonstrates a high specific capacity of 185.42 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 99%. Moreover, it exhibits excellent cycling stability, achieving 10000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1 with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.0008% per cycle, ranking it among the best&#8208;performing polymeric host&#8208;based Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries in the literature. Density functional theory (DFT) and in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements illustrate the impressive suppression of polyiodide shuttle effect comes from the strong interaction between N&#8208;modification enhanced polyhydroxy sites in NH&#8208;NFs&#8208;PDA and polyiodide. This work may shed new light on the design of advanced polymeric iodine hosts in Zn&#8208;I&#8322; batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance the surface reactivity of Mo&#8208;based TMD monolayers &#8211; MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 &#8211; but also amplify differences in their physicochemical properties, leading to distinct surface interactions. This effect originates from the intrinsic characteristics of Mo&#8211;X bonding in these monolayers.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of 

MoS2

 ${{\rm{MoS}}_2 }$



, 

MoSe2

 ${{\rm{MoSe}}_2 }$



, and 

MoTe2

 ${{\rm{MoTe}}_2 }$



, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and 

NO2

 ${{\rm{NO}}_2 }$



. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.

Abstract
Bioorthogonal functionalization in the minor groove of DNA with protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA, 1) as a target site is described. Cyclopropene and heptene as part of 2&#8208;aminoacyl protecting groups served as dienophiles in inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions with 3,6&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as diene. For the purpose, bis&#8208;protection of 1 with cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl groups was conducted. Selective removal of the 6&#8208;amino protecting groups gave mono&#8208;protected 1. 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates were accessed by iEDDA cycloaddition with tetrazine. Second order rate constants disclosed faster reaction kinetics for cyclopropenyl than for heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. To access protected oligonucleotides, phosphoramidites prepared from bis&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA were used in standard solid&#8208;phase synthesis. 2&#8208;Amino protecting groups were retained using mild deprotection conditions. Hybridization experiments disclosed increased duplex stability when protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA&#8208;dT pairs replaced 1&#8208;dT pairs. Mismatch discrimination of cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA was superior to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. iEDDA reactions on protected oligonucleotides furnished oligonucleotide pyridazine conjugates. In base pairs with dT, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates connected by a short rigid cyclopropenyl ring led to reduced thermal stability, whereas pyridazine conjugates attached by a long flexible linker retained duplex stability. The findings of this investigation pave the way for functionalization and labelling in the minor groove of DNA using copper free iEDDA cycloaddition.

         <title>Integration of Ultrasmall Pt Clusters With Silanol Groups in Pure Silica Zeolites for Robust Formaldehyde Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine Pt nanoclusters encapsulated within silicalite&#8208;1 zeolite were synthesized for formaldehyde oxidation at room temperature. The synergistic effect of Pt and adjacent silanol nests plays a key role in enhancing catalytic activity. The catalyst achieves complete formaldehyde removal even at 0.1 wt% Pt loading, with exceptional stability and water resistance, making it a promising solution for indoor air purification.








Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major indoor air pollutant that poses serious health risks. Catalytic oxidation of HCHO to CO2 and H2O at room temperature offers an efficient solution. Supported Pt nanoparticles are the most efficient catalysts, but challenges such as high cost and water resistant, limit their widespread application.

     alt="Integration of Ultrasmall Pt Clusters With Silanol Groups in Pure Silica Zeolites for Robust Formaldehyde Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine Pt nanoclusters encapsulated within silicalite-1 zeolite were synthesized for formaldehyde oxidation at room temperature. The synergistic effect of Pt and adjacent silanol nests plays a key role in enhancing catalytic activity. The catalyst achieves complete formaldehyde removal even at 0.1 wt% Pt loading, with exceptional stability and water resistance, making it a promising solution for indoor air purification.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major indoor air pollutant that poses serious health risks. Catalytic oxidation of HCHO to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at room temperature offers an efficient solution. Supported Pt nanoparticles are the most efficient catalysts, but challenges such as high cost and water resistant, limit their widespread application. Herein, we employ a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction strategy to encapsulate ultrafine Pt clusters within hydrophobic silicalite-1 zeolite. C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption, and solid nuclear magnetic resonance measurements confirmed that the Pt clusters are stabilized within zeolite channels by adjacent silanol groups. The optimized Pt@S-1-400H catalyst achieved complete HCHO removal at room temperature, with even low Pt loading of 0.1 wt%, affording a high specific activity of 171.9 mol&lt;sub&gt;HCHO&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;mol&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the top level among all state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. Significantly, the hydrophobic nature of silicalite-1 ensures excellent water resistance and long-term stability for the Pt@S-1-400H catalyst. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveals that silanol sites facilitate HCHO adsorption and the formation of formate intermediates. The synergistic effect between Pt clusters and adjacent silanol sites enhances the HCHO oxidation performance. The simple and cost-effective approach, combined with its excellent activity and stability, holds significant potential for effectively eliminating indoor pollutants in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Induced by Achiral Dyes in Organogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assembly strategy is widely applied to develop circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, especially for centrally chiral system. The CPL sign of supramolecular gels based on centrally chiral compound is generally regulated by employing the opposite chiral enantiomers. However, controlling CPL signals by regulating interaction model between achiral fluorophore with chiral gelator, accompanied by the adjustment of the emission wavelength, remains challenging. Herein, we have developed binary supramolecular gels based on achiral cyanostilbene derivatives and a chiral gelator. Two binary supramolecular gels have displayed achiral fluorophore&#8208;induced CPL sign inversion, attributing to the hydrogen bonding interaction between the carboxyl group of two fluorophores and the amino group of chiral gelator. This work reveals a rational approach to the design of CPL material with tunable CPL sign.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Lewis base&#8208;free trialumane having a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Tip) substituent was synthesized by a reaction of alumanyl anion with TipAlBr2. The structure, bonding, and electronic properties of the Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane were estimated by NMR spectra, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, DFT calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, and electrochemical study to reveal its two consecutive Al&#8211;Al covalent bonds and overlapped vacant orbitals of three Al atoms. Chemical reduction of Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane gave a series of alumanyl anions via the cleavage of the Al&#8211;Al bonds. This study shows the low&#8208;lying characteristic LUMO that consists of vacant orbitals of three Al atoms in the base&#8208;free trialumane.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Naphthalimide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled materials have gained significant attention in recent years because of their exceptional versatility and wide range of applications, from sensors and electronics to biomedical. Naphthalimides derivatives, with ease of functionalization and robust photophysical properties, became an ideal platform for creating highly ordered self&#8208;assembled architectures with tailored functionalities. This review provides an overall understanding of the recent developments in the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of naphthalimide&#8208;based materials, focusing on how self&#8208;assembly enhances their performance in various applications. The review examines the role of self&#8208;assembly in improving these materials&#8217; optical, mechanical, and electronic properties, highlighting their use in sensors for detecting gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and amines. Furthermore, the integration of self&#8208;assembled naphthalimides in light&#8208;emitting devices, energy harvesting systems, and fluorescence&#8208;based imaging demonstrates their potential in both electronic and biological applications. By analysing recent developments in molecular design, self&#8208;assembly strategies, and applications, this review aims to offer insights into how these materials can be optimized for future technological advancements.</dc:description>

         <title>Catechol&#8208;functionalized Covalent Organic Framework: Synthesis, Characterization and Metal&#8208;free Organocatalyst for CO2 Fixation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating hydrogen bond donor (HBD) moieties show great promise for heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 cycloaddition. In this work, a catechol&#8208;functionalized COF (BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF) was constructed via Schiff&#8208;base condensation under solvothermal conditions, which was characterized using PXRD, FT&#8208;IR, solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, SEM, HR&#8208;TEM, DRS and CV. BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF presents high crystallinity, large BET surface area (523 m2 g&#8208;1) and remarkable chemical stability, along with abundant hydroxyl functional groups distributed on the pore wall. This framework shows a CO2 adsorption capacity up to 88 mg g&#8208;1 at 273 K and 1 bar. The binding locations of the adsorption of CO2 over BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF was studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF displays remarkable catalytic performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides under mild conditions. Under the condition of the epichlorohydrin/tetrabutylammonium bromide/BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF molar ratio of 10210:630:4, the system achieved 62.5% substrate conversion at 25&#176;C under atmospheric CO2 pressure (1 bar) within 48 h. Mechanistic insights into epoxide adsorption and activation processes were investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The combination of a visible&#8208;light switchable azobenzene A with aliphatic diamines X of variable chain lengths gives access to various macrocyclic isomers. While diamines with even numbers of methylene groups exclusively create Z,Z&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles, both Z,Z&#8208; and E,E&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles are accessible starting from odd&#8208;numbered diamines. This study gives a deepened overview of the accessibility of macrocyclic isomers governed by a rational even&#8211;odd alteration of simple diamines.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembliy of red&#8208;light switchable, functionalised ortho&#8208;difluoroazobenzene isomers E&#8208;/Z&#8208;A with aliphatic diamines exhibits an alternating match/mismatch behaviour depending on the diamine's chain length. While even&#8208;numbered diamines exclusively form imine macrocycles with the Z&#8208;configured azobenzene isomer, odd&#8208;numbered diamines form photoswitchable, defined macrocycles. The formation of Z,Z&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles was demonstrated with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208; (B) and hexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diamine (H), while additionally E,E&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles were obtained with propane&#8208;1,3&#8208; (Pr), pentane&#8208;1,5&#8208;diamine (Pe), and diethylene glycol bisamine (O), validated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of E,E&#8208;A2Pr2 and E,E&#8208;A2O2. The observed reactivity differences arise from the preferred conformations of the flexible diamines in solution, which alternate predictably with odd and even numbers of methylene groups, investigated by 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR experiments, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These findings provide detailed insight into photoresponsive self&#8208;assembled systems and highlight the potential of azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry, offering new opportunities for controlling structure and function in adaptive materials.

         <title>Mediated Electrochemical Oxidation of Nucleosides to Their 5&#8242;&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet oxidation method: A mediated electrochemical oxidation method has been developed that enables selective oxidation of the nucleosides and ribosugars to afford the 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The method tolerates each of the nucleobases and various protecting group variations.








Abstract
Nucleoside 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxylic acids are important synthetic targets, but most existing methods to access these compounds use (super)stoichiometric chemical oxidants to oxidize the primary alcohol. The present study introduces an aminoxyl&#8208;mediated electrochemical method for oxidation of nucleosides and ribosugars to afford their 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The optimized conditions employ 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (ACT) as the aminoxyl mediator in a water/acetonitrile solvent mixture with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate or monohydrogen phosphate as a base within an undivided electrolysis cell. The reaction tolerates diverse functionality at the nucleobase and sugar positions and is showcased in the oxidation of 10 different substrates, including a 10 g scale oxidation of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylcytidine.

         <title>Polyacrylamide&#8208;Grafted MXenes Prepared via On&#8208;Surface Polymerization Demonstrated Enhanced Aqueous Dispersion and Colloidal Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a novel type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes demonstrated great potentials for biomedical applications due to their excellent photothermal and photodynamic properties. However, their exposed unmodified surface cannot ensure sufficient stability for MXene in biological environment. Here, we developed an efficient method to modify the surface of MXenes in aqueous medium. A water&#8208;soluble initiator was designed and covalently anchored onto MXene surfaces, which was used to initiate copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization to introduce a layer of water soluble polyacrylamide on MXene surfaces (PAM&#8208;MXenes). Impressively, it was found that the grafting of the polymer layer on MXene surfaces greatly enhanced the colloidal stability of modified MXenes which keep well dispersed in cell culture medium for over 7 days and for over one month in water without aggregation or sedimentation. Furthermore, their photothermal properties were not influenced as the PAM&#8208;MXenes demonstrated uncompromised heat&#8208;generating capacities upon irradiation at 808 nm nor did they cause marked toxicity to cells. This was the first reported example of directly growing polymer chains from the MXene surfaces. Thus, our work provided an effective approach to ameliorate the surface properties of MXene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Amphiphilic Compounds: Insights into Their Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and complete characterization of two carbohydrate&#8208;derived amphiphiles are described. Dynamic light scattering and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering confirmed the formation of reverse micelles with low polydispersity indices in two biocompatible solvents, while in toluene, reverse vesicles were detected.








Abstract
This study describes the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly properties of two sugar&#8208;derived surfactants constructed by click reaction from readily accessible building blocks. After structural characterization, their self&#8208;assembly processes were studied in two biocompatible solvents, isopropyl myristate and methyl laurate, as well as in toluene. Detailed experiments by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) confirmed the formation of reverse micelles (RMs). The findings reveal the formation of spherical aggregates with low polydispersity indices, indicating a high degree of size uniformity. SAXS analysis further demonstrated that these aggregates possess a smooth and well&#8208;defined RMs&#8208;nonpolar solvent interface. Notably, the system in toluene as the non&#8208;polar phase exhibited a unique behavior, suggesting distinct structural characteristics that differ from those observed in the biocompatible solvents. A low&#8208;resolution structural model revealed that the aggregates contain an internal gap compatible with a reverse vesicle consisting of a bilayer of amphiphile with the hydrophilic heads pointing towards the interior and the exterior of the bilayer with toluene on both sides of the bilayer. In summary, this study explores the self&#8208;assembly characteristics of sugar&#8208;based surfactants in non&#8208;polar environments that mimic biological membranes. The findings highlight the significant potential of these surfactants in supramolecular chemistry and glycobiology.

         <title>Photoinduced Stable Circularly Polarized Luminescent Radicals From a Triphenylamine&#8208;Attached Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced organic radicals with unique luminescent properties are highly sought&#8208;after due to their important prospects in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, the current development of organic free radicals, including photoinduced ones, is significantly limited and faces challenges related to stability and poor luminescence behavior. Taking advantage of the photoelectric activity of triarylamine, we herein describe an unusual luminescent radical, which can be rapidly generated by UV&#8208;irradiation of a solid&#8208;state triarylamine&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated pillar[5]arene (EtP5NN) in air, accompanied by luminescent color switching from bluish&#8208;violet to sky&#8208;blue. The persistent radicals within EtP5NN with a half&#8208;life of 12.7 hours suggest that the pillar[5]arene&#8208;skeleton straightforwardly improves the stability of radicals. The sterically bulky triarylamine groups inhibits the racemization of planar chiral pillar[5]arene, and allows the optical resolution of this system. The enhancement of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is triggered by UV&#8208;irradiation of the enantiomers (pS/pR&#8208;EtP5NN) in the solid state.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced organic radicals with unique luminescent properties are highly sought-after due to their important prospects in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, the current development of organic free radicals, including photoinduced ones, is significantly limited and faces challenges related to stability and poor luminescence behavior. Taking advantage of the photoelectric activity of triarylamine, we herein describe an unusual luminescent radical, which can be rapidly generated by UV-irradiation of a solid-state triarylamine-functionalized &#960;-conjugated pillar[5]arene (EtP5NN) in air, accompanied by luminescent color switching from bluish-violet to sky-blue. The persistent radicals within EtP5NN with a half-life of 12.7 hours suggest that the pillar[5]arene-skeleton straightforwardly improves the stability of radicals. The sterically bulky triarylamine groups inhibits the racemization of planar chiral pillar[5]arene, and allows the optical resolution of this system. The enhancement of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is triggered by UV-irradiation of the enantiomers (pS/pR-EtP5NN) in the solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Pursuit of Carbon Neutrality: Progresses and Innovations in Sorbents for Direct Air Capture of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct air capture (DAC) is of immense current interest, as a means to facilitate CO2 capture at low concentrations (~400 ppm) directly from the atmosphere, with the aim to address global warming caused by excessive anthropogenic CO2 production. Traditionally, DAC of CO2 has relied on amine scrubbing and metal carbonate /hydroxide solutions. However, recent years have seen notable progress in DAC sorbents, with key advancements aimed at improving efficiency, capacity, and regenerability while reducing energy consumption. This review delivers an exhaustive analysis of contemporary developments in DAC sorbents, addressing the innovations in material design and consequent performance enhancement. The limitations of the sorbents have also been discussed, with future perspectives for improving sustainable CO2 capture strategies. We anticipate that this overview will help lay the groundwork for further development and largescale implementation of sustainable sorbents and cutting&#8208;edge technologies towards attaining carbon neutrality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ab Initio Study on Doped Cu138X2 Nanoparticles with dispersed surface active sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit significant potential in electrocatalysis owing to their tunable electronic structure and abundant surface&#8208;active sites. However, the multifaceted complexity of Cu&#8208;based nanoparticles induced by heteroatom dopants fundamentally limits our ability to decipher the nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction (NO3RR) mechanism, creating a critical knowledge gap that obstructs the targeted engineering of advanced catalysts with atomic precision. In this study, we employed first&#8208;principles calculations to design a series of highly surface&#8208;dispersed transition metal&#8208;doped Cu138X2 (X = Ag, Au, Pd, Zn) bimetallic electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia, based on the structure of Cu140 NPs. Theoretical analysis revealed that Cu138Au2 exhibits significant advantages in NO3RR, with a remarkably low limiting potential of &#8208;0.20 eV. Additionally, significant energy barriers were observed for the formation of by&#8208;products NO and NO2 on Cu138Au2, ensuring high selectivity towards ammonia. For Cu&#8208;based catalysts, we propose that the *NO2 &#8594; *HNO2 step is critical and can serve as a descriptor for rapid screening of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This study not only provides important insights into the research of Cu NPs as NO3RR electrocatalysts but also establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing their catalytic performance through surface modification or compositional tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Living Detergents&#8221;: An In Situ Detergent Tailoring Strategy for Efficient Membrane Protein Stabilization and Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are essential molecular tools for membrane protein (MP) research, yet traditional detergents with static properties often fail to address the diverse and evolving needs of MP studies. To this end, this study introduces &#8220;living detergents&#8221;, an innovative class of detergents equipped with functional tags that enable biorthogonal modifications with externally introduced structural elements. This approach allows for not only the parallel generation of new detergents, but also in situ tuning of MP samples within freshly formed detergents. The efficacy of this strategy was demonstrated through the rapid identification of optimal detergents for high&#8208;quality electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. Overall, this flexible and robust platform enables efficient tailoring of detergents, advancing the exploration of detergent structure&#8208;function relationships in MP research and opening pathways for more specialized solutions for diverse experimental demands.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Supramolecular (Auto)Photocatalysis via the Synthesis of N&#8208;Vinylacetamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efforts to enhance photocatalysts prioritize improving their accessibility and practicality in photocatalytic applications. Supramolecular (auto)photocatalysis, which exploits transient self&#8208;assembled complexes, facilitates visible light&#8208;driven reactions, with autocatalytic systems promoting sustainable and atom&#8208;economical processes. In this study, the photocatalyst Mes&#8208;Acr&#8208;MeClO4, typically active under blue light, formed a dark red charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with N&#8208;bromoacetamide (NBA) in the presence of K2CO3 in DCE, enabling green&#8208;light photocatalysis. This self&#8208;assembled CT complex initiated an auto&#8208;photocatalytic process via two&#8208;photon absorption, generating an N&#8208;centered radical that drove anti&#8208;Markovnikov, syn&#8208;periplanar addition to phenylacetylene, achieving exclusive Z&#8208;selective formation of (Z)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylvinyl)acetamide. Interestingly, the product itself functioned as a potent green&#8208;LED photocatalyst (&#955;em ~518 nm, &#964; ~10 ns), driving its own synthesis with added terminal alkynes. With 100% atom economy, this work highlights a system chemistry approach, showcasing a highly efficient, self&#8208;sustaining catalytic process that advances green and sustainable synthetic strategies. This protocol emphasizes sustainability with an outstanding E&#8208;factor of 11.15, reflecting minimal waste production (11.15 kg per 1 kg of product) and demonstrating a strong commitment to green chemistry principles.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Coating of Al&#8208;Doped Spinel Oxides on Ni Mesh for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial alkaline water electrolysis requires catalyst electrode with high alkaline resistance and scalability due to the high alkaline concentration, frequent gas desorption, and high hydrogen production power involved. However, most high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are poorly adhered to conductive substrates, such as nickel foam or carbon paper, leading to detachment and performance degradation under harsh industrial conditions. Here, we report a simple and scalable strategy of "immersion&#8211;infrared drying&#8211;calcination" to fabricate Al&#8208;doped spinel oxides in situ grown on mechanically robust Ni mesh. By further simple cation substitution, we effectively modulate the metal&#8211;oxygen bond length in the octahedral center and the valence state of active sites, significantly enhancing OER activity. Electrochemical tests (1 M KOH, 25 &#176;C) show that NiAl0.5Co1.5O4 exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 234 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Remarkably, under industrial conditions (6 M KOH, 60 &#176;C), it achieves an overpotential of only 448 mV at a current density of 400 mA cm&#8208;2, which is superior to that of commercial Raney Ni catalysts. Moreover, the scalable electrode demonstrates excellent resistance to concentrated alkaline solutions and high current densities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1&#8208;Indanone derivatives are efficiently synthesized via a radical cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes, using TBHP as both oxidant and reactant, in the presence of Cu(I) as the catalyst and 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid as the cocatalyst. Notably, in the absence of 4&#8208;methyl benzoic acid, the reaction undergoes a dramatic shift in product selectivity, yielding 1H&#8209;cyclopropa[b]naphthalene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diones exclusively under the same conditions, with Cu(I) acting as the sole catalyst. This transformation offers key advantages, including operational simplicity, cost&#8208;effective and readily available materials, scalability to gram quantities, and compatibility with a wide range of functional groups. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirmed that the reaction proceeds through a radical pathway, highlighting the pivotal role of 4&#8208;methylbenzoic acid as the cocatalyst in altering product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Dependent Energy&#8208;Gap Modulation of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems Based on Hypervalent Silicon(IV)&#8208;Fused Azomethine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The colors of substances and emission are determined by the width of the energy gap between frontier molecular orbitals. In general, significant structural transformation or chemical modification is essential to tune the energy gap. Herein, we reveal a hypervalent silicon compound can form both square pyramidal (SP) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) geometries and demonstrate a novel technique to modulate the energy gap of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The energy gap in the TBP geometry is narrower than that in the SP geometry owing to stronger contribution of a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are changeable by external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations. Correspondingly, the emission bands in the orange (&#955;PL = 640 nm) and yellow (&#955;PL = 579 nm) regions were observed from the TBP geometry at room temperature and the SP geometry at &#8722;196 &#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, the geometry can be fixed to the TBP geometry by introducing bulky substituents at silicon. These mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically clarified in detail. Our findings described here are expected to be a novel molecular design for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Self&#8208;Ion Exchange Mechanism in Na2Mn3O7 for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the Mn&#8208;based cathode material Na2Mn3O7, synthesized using a sol&#8211;gel method. A self&#8208;ion exchange reaction in Na2Mn3O7 drives the phase transition to ZnMn3O73H2O before electrochemical cycling in ZnSO4&#8211;based electrolyte. The resulting hydrated ZnMn3O7&#183;3H2O phase incorporates Zn2+ ions and H2O molecules, stabilizing the lattice and improving Zn&#8208;ion battery performance with a reversible capacity of &#8764;240 mAhg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based cathode materials have attracted significant interest in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, affordability, and environmentally friendly nature. Recently, Na2Mn3O7 (NMO) has emerged as a promising electrode material for ZIBs owing to its unique triclinic crystal structure, which consists of infinite parallel [Mn3O7]2&#8315; layers. This layered framework includes a vacancy at one of the seven Mn sites, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the insertion and accommodation of incoming Zn2+ ions. This structural feature allows for efficient zinc intercalation, transforming NMO into a Zn&#8211;Mn&#8208;based system electrochemically. In this study, the focus is on investigating the mechanism of self&#8208;ion exchange occurring in NMO, utilizing an electrolyte composed of 2&#160;M ZnSO4 and 0.1&#160;M MnSO4, exhibiting a reversible capacity of &#8764;240 mAh g&#8722;1 at a C/10 rate with a Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99%. The self&#8208;ion exchange mechanism and structural changes during the battery operation were investigated using ex&#8208;situ x&#8208;ray diffraction and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The reversible phase transformations between hydrated and partially dehydrated states suggest a robust mechanism for Zn2+ ion insertion and extraction, contributing to the stability and performance of the Zn&#8211;Mn electrode material in ZIB applications.

         <title>On the Facile Synthesis of Triazaarsoles Using Acyclic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easily accessible dichloroarsanes are suitable precursors for the synthesis of novel triazaarsoles, the arsenic analogues of tetrazoles and triazaphospholes. Our findings pave the way to access and fully investigate such aromatic arsenic heterocycles in detail.








Abstract
Easily accessible dichloroarsanes are suitable precursors for the synthesis of rarely explored triazaarsoles, the arsenic analogues of tetrazoles and triazaphospholes. Calculations on the DFT level gave insight into the electronic structure of such planar compounds, indicating a high degree of aromaticity. Our preliminary investigations pave the way for accessing and investigating a whole variety of new heterocycles that contain a low&#8208;coordinated arsenic atom.

         <title>Molecular dynamics of high&#8208;pressure liquid water: Going from ambient to near&#8208;critical temperatures.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of high&#8208;pressure liquid water were investigated along the isobar of 25 MPa and in the temperature range 298.15&#8208;623.15 K using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Particular attention has been given to the changes in the local structural and related dynamic properties of liquid water. The results obtained have revealed noticeable changes in the shape of the calculated radial distribution functions, as well as the existence of local extrema or crossovers in several structural descriptors and entropic quantities at temperatures around 423.15 K and 498.15 K, where also significant changes in the hydrogen bond network of liquid water have also been observed. The temperature dependence of translational, reorientational and hydrogen bond dynamics of liquid water has also been investigated by calculating the translational self&#8208;diffusion and the corresponding O&#8208;H vector Legendre reorientational correlation times and hydrogen bond lifetimes. The corresponding activation energies for each investigated relaxation process have also been presented and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Scrambled RGD hexameric peptide hydrogel supports efficient self&#8208;assembly and cell activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid sequence is crucial in controlling peptide&#8208;based hydrogel formation, whereby changing the position of a single amino acid can significantly alter the gel&#8217;s properties. Herein, we report the gelation kinetics and cell viability of scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG (where we have scrambled the RGD&#8208;based gel hexapeptide; Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD). The scrambled sequence showed improved gelation properties compared to the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence with scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG forming a gel in under 10 minutes, significantly faster than the 2&#8208;hour gelation time, and at a concentration eight times lower than the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence. We also examined the combination of the two gelators in a ratio of 1:1, final concentration of 0.4% (w/v). Interestingly, the stiffness of hybrid hydrogel was ~3 kPa, whereas individually, neither gelator at the same concentration exceeded 0.5 kPa. The cell&#8208;adhesion motif RGD improves the ability of the peptides to promote attachment of cells due to integrin recognition. However, when fibroblasts were cultured on the hydrogels, the scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG yielded a higher level of &#945;&#8208;SMA expression in cells than those cultured on Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD, suggesting a microenvironment conducive to myofibroblast transitions. This study provides a new outlook on how a well&#8208;known scrambled peptide motif (RDG) can fine&#8208;tune hydrogel assembly and cell culture applications.</dc:description>

The scrambled sequence showed improved gelation properties compared to the original Fmoc-GFFRGD sequence with scrFmoc-GFFRDG forming a gel in under 10 minutes, significantly faster than the 2-hour gelation time, and at a concentration eight times lower than the original Fmoc-GFFRGD sequence. We also examined the combination of the two gelators in a ratio of 1:1, final concentration of 0.4% (w/v). Interestingly, the stiffness of hybrid hydrogel was ~3 kPa, whereas individually, neither gelator at the same concentration exceeded 0.5 kPa. The cell-adhesion motif RGD improves the ability of the peptides to promote attachment of cells due to integrin recognition. However, when fibroblasts were cultured on the hydrogels, the scrFmoc-GFFRDG yielded a higher level of &#945;-SMA expression in cells than those cultured on Fmoc-GFFRGD, suggesting a microenvironment conducive to myofibroblast transitions. This study provides a new outlook on how a well-known scrambled peptide motif (RDG) can fine-tune hydrogel assembly and cell culture applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preassembly&#8208;Controlled Radical Recombination at Bismuth: Decarboxylative C&#8211;N Coupling with Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent transition metal radicals form the foundation for many metallaphotoredox protocols. Their ability to efficiently trap organic radicals and convert them into various coupling products has inspired the exploration of selective radical reactions even beyond the d&#8208;block. Radical processes involving bismuth hold great potential but innovative strategies are required to control the reactivity of bismuth intermediates. Herein we report preassembly as a powerful strategy to enforce a selective recombination of a bismuth(II) radical and an organic radical. As a result, an inner&#8208;sphere pathway is accessed, enabling the formation of C&#8211;N coupling products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Ratiometric Sensor for Detection of Anions in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensors that respond to anions via vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) have recently emerged as effective tools for discrimination between closely related carboxylate species in non&#8208;competitive, organic solvents. However, the utility of this sensing mechanism has not yet been demonstrated for anions in aqueous media. Here, we prepared two sensors, monoZnDPA&#8208;DPAC and ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC, with either one or two anion&#8208;binding motifs. These systems are capable of binding to anions in water. Dual emission via VIE is maintained in solvent mixtures of up to 70% water. ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC provides a unique, ratiometric response to citrate and phosphate, which was used for the accurate quantification of aqueous solutions of these anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Designed Metal&#8208;Free Quasi&#8208;1D Crystals with Giant Birefringence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringence, a vital property of anisotropic crystals, is indispensable for advanced optical technologies. Quasi&#8211;one&#8211;dimensional (quasi&#8211;1D) structures, with their inherent structural anisotropy, offer fertile ground for discovering materials with exceptional optical anisotropy. In this work, we report four metal&#8211;free quasi&#8211;1D crystals&#8212;(C5H6NO)+(NO3)&#8211; (4HPN), (C5H6NO)+(HC2O4)&#8211; (4HPO), (C4N3H6)+(NO3)&#8211; (2APMN), and (C4N3H6)+(HC2O4)&#8211;&#183;H2O (2APMO)&#8212;designed to feature pseudo&#8208;chain structures and grown as centimeter&#8211;scale crystals via a facile aqueous&#8208;solution method. These crystals display wide bandgaps (3.40&#8211;4.48 eV) and exceptional birefringence, with calculated values up to 0.555@546 nm and an experimental maximum of 0.597@546 nm for 4HPN. The giant birefringence stems from their quasi&#8208;1D architectures, high spatial density, and optimal arrangement of the birefringence&#8211;active groups (BAGs). This study highlights the promise of metal&#8211;free quasi&#8211;1D materials for next&#8208;generation miniaturized polarization optics and laser&#8211;driven applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Immunological and Toxicological Assessment of Triterpenoid Saponins Bearing Lewis&#8208;X&#8208; and QS&#8208;21&#8208;Based Trisaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for safer and more effective vaccine adjuvants has intensified in recent years, with triterpenoid saponins like QS&#8208;21 and its analogues emerging as promising candidates. We report the synthesis of a novel QS&#8208;21 analogue featuring betulinic acid as aglycone, a lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid with low toxicity derived from white birch bark. Two convergent synthetic routes, involving different protecting groups and glycosyl donors (bromide and trichloroacetimidate), were optimized to construct the QS&#8208;21&#8208;based linear trisaccharide motif critical for adjuvant activity. This strategy also enabled efficient preparation of the structurally similar echinocystic acid analogue reported by Gin. The immunological and toxicological profiles of these chimeric saponins, along with Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing and rhamnose&#8208;modified derivatives, were evaluated in C57BL/6 wild&#8208;type and hDC&#8208;SIGN transgenic mice. While the synthetic saponins exhibited low toxicity in vitro and in vivo, replacing echinocystic acid with betulinic acid reduced immunogenicity when tested with ovalbumin as a model antigen compared to alhydrogel and QS&#8208;21. These findings provide a foundation for developing saponin&#8208;based adjuvants and demonstrate the utility of advanced glycosylation strategies for synthesizing complex unnatural triterpenoid saponins.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Photoluminescence Properties of EuSiN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the europium nitridosilicate, EuSiN2 a novel member of the multifaceted MSiN2 family is presented and compared with the structural similar compounds MSiN2 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba). A different way of presenting the structure as M&#8208;N polyhedra layers is introduced.
The crystal structure of EuSiN2, being isotypical to SrSiN2, was determined and refined based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data in space group P21/c (no. 14) with a = 5.96381(2)&#197;, b = 7.25982(3)&#197;, c = 5.488338(19)&#197;, &#946; = 113.33&#176;, V = 218.18(5)&#197;3 and Z = 4.
As the Eu2+&#8208;doped MSiN2 compounds show excellent luminescence properties as LED phosphors, the luminescence behavior of dark red emitting EuSiN2 has been investigated as well. Two emission peaks are visible at 708 nm and 764 nm.
Many europium doped nitridosilicates show more or less developed shoulders for their luminescence peaks, but two clearly shaped emission peaks are a novel feature for nitridosilicates.
Comprehensive and detailed comparisons are given and discussed based on works in literature.
The chromaticity coordinate positions of EuSiN2 in the CIE 1931 diagram are x = 0.678 and y = 0.284.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;selective Electrochemical Decarboxylative Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unified electrochemical decarboxylative strategy for the site&#8208;selective construction of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds is disclosed herein. The metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free decarboxylation provides access to functionalization of C&#8208; and N&#8208;terminus from simple amino acid feedstock. A wide variety of primary, secondary and tertiary acids or alcohols were well tolerated. Late stage functionalization using &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose, di&#8208;peptide, steroids derivatives and bio&#8208;active drug molecules established the robustness and synthesis potential of our approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Conjugates of Artificial Ribonucleases: Sequence Specific Cleavage with Multiple Turnover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The azido modified RNA cleaving catalyst 2 has been attached to oligonucleotides containing alkyne linkers in a central position. The resulting conjugates hybridize specifically with complementary RNA strands and cleave them with multiple substrate turnover. RNA half&#8208;lives are in the range of 6&#8208;7 h (pH 8, 37 &#176;C). Some well placed LNA nucleotides can further increase substrate affinities and reaction rates significantly (t&#189; of 3.5 h, kobs = 0.20 h&#8208;1). RNA cleavage does not require metal ions and runs equally well in the presence of EDTA. Fragments of precisely defined lengths are formed, well suited for subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry and related bioanalytical techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Coexistence of the Perfluorinated Cp* Anion with Oxidizing and Electrophilic Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;air&#8208; and water stable perfluorinated Cp* [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; &#160;is presented as a candidate for the vastly underexplored group of weakly coordinating carbanions (WCCAs). Its extreme electron deficiency combined with the stabilization of the negative charge within an aromatic system results in a low basicity, yielding a very weak coordination ability. As Cp anions usually possess a strongly pronounced carbanionic character, the perfluorinated Cp* resembles an extraordinary exception for both the WCA and Cp chemistry.&#160; However, the coordination ability remains ambivalent due to the substitution lability of many of its complexes, allowing for the formation of unique ligand&#8208;WCA switches. Due to the low reactivity, there is a need for new transfer reagents containing the perfluorinated Cp* in combination with reactive cations. Thus, we report the synthesis and complete characterization of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; salts with hydride&#8208;accepting [(C6H5)3C]+, valuable Ag(I) reagents, oxidizing [Fe(C5H5)2]+ or [N(p&#8208;C6H4Br)3]+ and Br&#248;nsted acidic [H(m,m&#8208;NC5H3F2)2]+. Notably, these unprecedented ion pairs are exclusively accessible and stabilized by the low coordination affinity and pronounced oxidative resistance of the perfluorinated Cp*.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Polymeric Dispersants on the Dissolution Rate of Tricalcium Silicate and the Nucleation of Calcium&#8208;Silicate&#8208;Hydrate and Portlandite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycarboxylate ether (PCE) and polyphosphate ether (PPE) dispersants (known as superplasticizers) are indispensable components of modern concrete mix designs. PCEs and PPEs cause retardation of the cement hydration as a secondary effect which causes delayed concrete strength development. It is proposed that the retardation is caused by the polymer influence on the tricalcium silicate dissolution rate and the crystallization of the hydration products (e.g., calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 and&#160; calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate C&#8208;S&#8208;H). This study examines the effect of four different polymeric superplasticizers with carboxylate and phosphate groups on the reaction kinetics of the pure cement phase tricalcium silicate (in cement shorthand C3S). Our results confirm the strong retarding effect of the polymers on the hydration reaction of the C3S paste. Based on model experiments, we studied the polymer influence on the dissolution of C3S and the nucleation of the hydration products. We observed no C3S dissolution inhibiting effect of the polymers at the chosen concentrations and undersaturation. However, such an inhibiting effect may occur as the saturation limit is approached. Titrimetric analyses indicate that all polymers suppress the nucleation of portlandite and C&#8208;S&#8208;H, with a higher polymer charge density leading to a more pronounced inhibition.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a detailed study on a photoredox catalysis platform that directly engages 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl C(sp3)&#8211;H acids towards radical reactions. This platform enables redox&#8208;neutral hydroalkylation and cross&#8208;coupling, as well as oxidative transformations that demonstrably improve on the prior state of the art. Herein, we present interrogations of the underlying catalytic cycle and mechanism for this platform through kinetic, thermodynamic, and computational studies.&#160;&#160;The present investigations also demonstrate the key role of lithium trifluoroacetate under complementary Ce&#8208;containing and Ce&#8208;free photoredox conditions to enable ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) or multi&#8208;site proton coupled electron transfer (MS&#8208;PCET) activations, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Substituted azetidines are privileged heterocyclic scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and have become synthetic targets of high interest in recent years.

By using benzyl chloroformate or trifluoroacetic anhydride as reacting partners, diversely substituted 3&#8208;chloroazetidines, 3&#8208;substituted azetidines and azetidin&#8208;3&#8208;ols bearing a trifluoromethyl group at C2 could be readily synthesized.

         <title>Directional Macrocycle Transport, Release and Recapture enabled by a Rotaxane Transporter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transporter for a directional macrocycle transport, release and recapture was constructed. This was achieved using a rotaxane featuring a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle, dibenzylammonium (DBA)/methyl triazolium (MTA) stations on the thread and anthracene/triisopropylsilyl&#8208;acetylene stoppers, respectively. In the protonated rotaxane, the macrocycle primarily resides on the DBA station, followed by directional shuttling to the MTA station upon treatment with base. Addition of fluoride as an additional chemical input cleaves the triisopropylsilyl stopper, leading to release of the macrocycle and the half&#8208;thread into solution. The released macrocycle can be recaptured by protonation, and the mechanical bond can be reestablished via CuAAC click reaction, enabled by the terminal acetylene unit on the half&#8208;thread. This generates an elongated second generation rotaxane transporter, which was used for a second cycle of directional macrocycle transport and release, proving the possibility of an iterative operation of the rotaxane&#8208;transporter in this molecular design.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilization of a Chelating Bis[(dialkylamino)cyclopropenimine] to Isolate a Series of Heavier Zero&#8208;Valent Group 14 Tetracarbonyl Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the utilization of the ethylene&#8208;bridged bis[(dialkylamino)cyclopropenimine] (bisCPI) ligand, LCPI, to give access to new main&#8208;group E(II) halide complexes (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; 1, 2, 3). Subsequent reduction with Collman&#8217;s reagent (Na2Fe(CO)4 &#8226; dioxane) enables the isolation of a series of monoatomic zero&#8208;valent tetrylone&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes, (LCPI)E(Fe(CO)4 (E = Ge (4), Sn (5), Pb (6)). Compounds 4 &#8208; 6 were reacted further with iron pentacarbonyl to yield the bis&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes (LCPI)E[(Fe(CO)4]2 (E = Ge (7), Sn (8), Pb (9)). The electronic structure of these complexes was studied by 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and computationally by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Supramolecular Adhesives Based on Natural Small Molecules Through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of ionic supramolecular adhesives based on polydisulfide polymers was constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;low dosage, enhanced adhesion performance, multi&#8208;environmental tolerance, and on&#8208;demand adhesion release. These properties are attributed to the intrinsic ordered polymer network structure and small molecule doping, which stabilizes the network and reduces chain entanglement.








Abstract
The environmental persistence and widespread application of conventional polymer adhesives raise critical concerns regarding network design complexity and long&#8208;term residue accumulation. Herein, we present a water&#8208;soluble supramolecular adhesive synthesized from natural small molecules. Unlike traditional polymer networks relying on weak intermolecular forces, this system establishes a robust ordered architecture through dynamic disulfide bond ring&#8208;opening polymerization and carboxylate ion electrostatic interactions. Water&#8208;soluble hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) strategically increases hydrogen&#8208;bonding site density while stabilizing the network topology, efficiently reducing chain entanglement. These synergistic effects endow the material with strong adhesion capability even at minimal usage (&#8764;0.4&#160;mg/cm2), achieving a maximum adhesion strength capable of supporting up to 107 times its weight while maintaining considerable resistance to various environmental factors, including thermal extremes (&#8722;80&#176;C to 120&#176;C) and exposure to organic solvents. This supramolecular design paradigm offers an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to conventional polymeric adhesives.

         <title>Synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Dinaphthyl Amino Acids: Towards Molecular Gearing in Peptides and Mini&#8208;Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acids bearing two aromatic side chains are studied here for their ability to align in rotor&#8208;like assemblies in a synthetic protein. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate a correlated molecular rotor&#8208;type behavior whose dynamic nature stands in remarkable contrast to established systems in the field of molecular bionics.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinaphthyl amino acids by directed CH&#8208;activation and their subsequent utilization in peptides. The synthesis of aromatic &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids is limited by sterical crowding for large aromatic ring systems. The amino acids are transformed into adequately protected building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis by using our amide weakening strategy. Our aim was to study the interactions of the side chain aryl groups in solution and solid state. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate conformational equilibria and compare them to established gearing systems.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of Ag&#8208;based electrode with the highly exposed and tightly contacted AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) active facets was constructed for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work can help understand the effects of crystal orientation and crystal face interface on electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x=0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 456&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Exploring Tyramine's Role in the Formation of Supramolecular Adducts with Nonsteroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An a priori design approach identified tyramine as an ideal co&#8208;former for obtaining new supramolecular adducts with nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs, speeding up the co&#8208;crystallization process. Three novel adducts and a new polymorphic form were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal XRD. The resulting adducts showed an improved equilibrium aqueous solubility.








Abstract
In pharmaceutical crystal engineering, salification and co&#8208;crystallization are well&#8208;established strategies to enhance the physicochemical properties of nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which typically exhibit low aqueous solubility. This study introduces three new multicomponent crystalline systems of NSAIDs (S&#8208;naproxen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen) with the co&#8208;former tyramine, designed using knowledge&#8208;based methods. Additionally, a new polymorph of the diflunisal&#8211;tyramine system, synthesized via mechanochemical techniques, is reported. The new multicomponent systems were thoroughly characterized using solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Aqueous solubility tests conducted through solution 1H NMR experiments revealed increased equilibrium solubility for all samples, highlighting the efficacy of crystal engineering in modulating the physicochemical properties of drugs.

The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene (NHCP) manganese complex [(NHC)PMn(CO)4] undergoes CO substitution reactions via an associative mechanism akin to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], with the (NHC)P ligand, switching between three&#8208;electron and one&#8208;electron donor modes. Phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the Mn&#8211;P double bond afford metalladiphosphiranes and metallaphosphachalcogeniranes with three&#8208;membered MnPE rings.








Abstract
The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe3 afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)4] (1) with the release of Me3SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#9472;P bond, indicative of double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)3] (2&#8211;5) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one&#8208; or three&#8208;electron donors. Complex 1 also underwent phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the manganese&#8208;phosphorus bond, resulting in metalladiphosphiranes (6, 7) and metallaphospha&#8208;chalcogeniranes (8, 9) with three&#8208;membered MnPP and MnPE (E = Se, Te) rings.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Atom Insertion of Indenes via Aerobic Ring Scission&#8211;Condensation&#8211;Rearomatization</title>

This study demonstrates a photocatalytic aerobic ring scission of indenes into dicarbonyl intermediates for efficient synthesis of isoquinoline derivatives via condensation/rearomatization event using NH4OAc as N source. Besides, naphthalene derivatives also can be archived through an elegant C atom insertion. Mechanistic studies reveal superoxide anion&#8208;mediated C&#9552;C cleavage rather than singlet oxygen

Abstract
In this study, we present a photocatalyzed single&#8208;atom insertion of indenes, involving an aerobic ring scission into dicarbonyl intermediates, which subsequently undergo condensation and rearomatization to efficiently synthesize isoquinoline and naphthalene derivatives. The use of an inexpensive organic dye as the photocatalyst under aerobic conditions with cheap ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) as the nitrogen source makes this method very practical and environmentally friendly to access isoquinoline. Alternatively, an intramolecular carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;insertion process, involving the Aldol reaction of the dicarbonyl intermediates, affords the naphthalenamine and naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives. Mechanistic studies support that the superoxide anion radical species mediates the C&#9552;C double bond scission of indenes rather than the singlet oxygen intermediate.

         <title>Molecular Rectangles Featuring Two Parallel NCN&#8208;Coordinated Platinum Units: Enhancing Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Through Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macro&#8208;cycling into the near&#8208;infrared: By incorporating two cyclometallated Pt(II) units into opposite sides of a molecular rectangle, the formation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting excited states that span the two units is promoted in solution, compared to the corresponding, acyclic, tweezer&#8208;like complexes. A degree of molecular reorganization is nevertheless required to form such states, which is inhibited in more rigid media.








Abstract
New macrocyclic molecules are described that incorporate Pt(NCN) units on opposite edges of a rectangular structure, with xanthene units constituting the other two sides. Here, NCN represents a cyclometallating tridentate ligand based on 2,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzene or its pyrimidine analog. The complexes display strong photoluminescence peaking in the near&#8208;infrared region of the spectrum in solution (&#955;max up to 761&#160;nm). Photophysical data and DFT calculations indicate that the emission arises from &#8220;intramolecular excimers&#8221;&#8212;triplet excited states that form when the two Pt(NCN) units within the molecule are brought into close proximity to interact interfacially. In doped polymers, the necessary molecular distortion is inhibited, but related excited states that emit in a similar region can still form through intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of an Adaptive Ni Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with One&#8208;Dimensional Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually becoming an ideal platform for investigating negative thermal expansion (NTE) owing to their designability and framework flexibility. In this work, we studied the thermal expansion phenomenon of the orthorhombic [Ni(L&#8208;cam)(4,4'&#8208;bpe)]n (L&#8208;cam = L&#8208;camphoric acid and 4,4'&#8208;bpe = 4,4'&#8208;vinylenedipyridine) with one&#8208;dimensional helical chains through thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The synergistic effect of the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe and the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion elucidated the mechanism of NTE along the c&#8208;axis. The positive thermal expansion (PTE) along the b&#8208;axis can be attributed to the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion of the helical chains. The a&#8208;axis was nearly unchanged exhibiting zero thermal expansion. The PTE happened in the unit cell volume due to the larger deformation along the b&#8208;axis compared to the c&#8208;axis. This study deepens our comprehension to the NTE of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs and provides a point of view for the design and synthesis in the development and investigation of other NTE materials.</dc:description>

         <title>High Drug Loading Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Nanodrug Delivery System Enhances Anticancer Efficacy and Reduces Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanodrug delivery is a critical approach in cancer therapy; however, the deposition of excipients often exacerbates the toxic burden of drugs. Herein, a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (WP5&#8835;C6Py@DOX) has been developed to enhance cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects. This system, constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions between a thioether&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene derivative (WP5) and a pyridinium salt derivative (C6Py), exhibited a remarkable 97% drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). It showed remarkable stability in both aqueous solutions and bovine serum, effectively minimizing premature drug leakage and reducing associated toxicity. The thioether modification of WP5 reacted with H2O2 to generate derivatives with improved water solubility, significantly enhancing biocompatibility while minimizing excipient deposition within endosomes. Cellular experiments revealed that the system not only reduced the toxicity of DOX to normal cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) but also significantly enhanced its antitumor activity against cancer cells (HepG2), with an IC50 of 1.2 &#956;M, markedly outperforming free DOX (IC50: 6.3 &#956;M). Furthermore, laser confocal imaging confirmed that the supramolecular drug delivery system effectively enters and accumulates in cancer cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Interesting Aromaticity of Franck&#8208;Condon Excited States of Cyclo[16]carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck&#8208;Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state. Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.&#160;These conclusions are supported by multiple robust indicators such as atomic force, induced current, and magnetic shielding, from qualitative, quantitative, and graphical perspectives.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck-Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground-state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state.

         <title>FeOHSO4@C Cathode with Low Strain and High Pseudocapacitance for Advanced Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based polyanionic cathode materials in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have appealed to an increasing number of interest due to these advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness and excellent structural stability. However, these inherent drawbacks of inferior electronic conductivity and terrible nanostructural stability hinder its practical application. Here we report a novel low&#8208;strain iron&#8208;based polyanion&#8208;type cathode material FeOHSO4@C for KIBs. In this work, the surface of FeOHSO4&#160;nanoparticles are well carbon encapsulated, carbon coating layer with large surface area and excellent electrical conductivity is ~2.5 nm in thick, which can not only inhibits the aggregation and growth between&#160;FeOHSO4@C nanoparticles during charging and discharging, but also provides a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electronic conductive framework that activates electrochemical reactivity. As a result, the FeOHSO4@C cathode exhibits outstanding potassium storage capacity (capacity retention of 80.95% over 200 cycles at 20 mA g&#8208;1) attributed to a low&#8208;strain mechanism for K+&#160;uptake/removal, high pseudocapacitance, as well as 3D electronic conductive framework. Operando XRD&#160;and ex situ&#160;XPS analyses revealed a single phase reaction route of orthorhombic FeOHSO4@C during cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorosulfenic Acid: An Important Linker in the Coupled Sulfur and Chlorine Chemistry in the Venusian Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry plays an important role in the chemical cycle of the Venusian atmosphere. However, the reactivity of the abundant sulfur monoxide (SO) toward hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the Venusian atmosphere remains hitherto unknown. In this work, we report the generation, spectroscopic characterization, and photochemistry of chlorosulfenic acid (HOSCl), a simple molecule that acts not only as a potential candidate for the near&#8208;UV absorber but also as an important linker in the coupled sulfur and chlorine chemistry in the Venusian atmosphere. This molecule has bright absorption from 330 to 440 nm. The photochemistry of HOSCl at 365 nm yields SO and HCl as a novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular complex in a cryogenic Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K, and the subsequent irradiation at 193 nm leads to recombination of the two fragments by reformation of HOSCl. The photochemistry of HOSCl underscores its importance in the photochemical models of the sulfur and chlorine species in Venusian atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexities and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt&#8208;Ag cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes. This study proves that the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in the molecular system, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Gold Super&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanosystem for SERS&#8208;Guided Oxygen&#8208;Independent Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer treatment remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and hypoxic microenvironment of tumors, which often compromises therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional gold super&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based nanosystem (GSPs1,4&#8208;BDT@PDA&#8208;AIPH&#8208;cRGD) was developed for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;guided oxygen&#8208;independent phototherapy. This nanosystem integrates diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities through a gold superlattice&#8208;nanoparticle (GSP) core self&#8208;assembled from 5.8 nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), functionalized with 1,4&#8208;benzenedithiol (1,4&#8208;BDT) as a Raman reporter. The GSPs are encapsulated with a polydopamine (PDA) shell for enhancing their structural stability, Raman signal amplification, and serving as a photothermal agent. The PDA coating is further loaded with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH), a oxygen independent photosensitizer that releases cytotoxic free radicals, and cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide for tumor targeting. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the nanosystem generates hyperthermia and releases free radicals, achieving oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation. Real&#8208;time SERS imaging ensures precise tumor monitoring, addressing key challenges in cancer management. This novel approach combines the benefits of highly sensitive SERS imaging, targeted drug delivery, and oxygen independent phototherapy, providing a robust platform for synergistic cancer diagnosis and treatment with significant therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Electrochemical Electrodes into Mass Spectrometry Ionization Sources for Detection of Transient Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying short&#8208;lived transient intermediates is challenging due to their brief lifetimes (as short as nanoseconds, and even picoseconds) and therefore low concentrations in many chemical processes. Conducting electrochemical reactions within mass spectrometry ion sources (i.e., insource or in situ EC&#8208;MS) offers the advantage of minimizing the distance between the electrodes and the mass spectrometer, thereby improving the detection of transient intermediates. However, a key challenge for in&#8208;source EC&#8208;MS is the effective integration of the electrodes into the MS ion sources. This mini&#8208;review highlights three main integration strategies: exploiting inherent electrochemical properties, incorporating a two&#8208; or three&#8208;electrode system, and implementing bipolar electrodes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, experimental setups, and applications of these approaches. Future perspectives emphasize the directions of designing and modifying ionization sources, integrating electrocatalysis, enhancing transfer efficiency, developing automated screening platforms, as well as expanding practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>[natY/90Y]Yttrium and [natLu/177Lu]Lutetium Complexation by Rigid H4OCTAPA Derivatives. Effect of Ligand Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/90Y]Y3+ and [nat/177Lu]Lu3+ with the new acyclic chelator H4CHXOITAPA. This octadentate chelator forms nine&#8208;coordinated Y3+ and Lu3+ complexes thanks to the coordination of a water molecule, as demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray structure of [Y(HCHXOITAPA)(H2O)] and 1H, 13C and 89Y NMR studies in solution. These complexes display slightly higher thermodynamic stabilities compared with those of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, reaching log KYL and log KLuL values of 21.24(5) and 21.96(1), respectively. Kinetic studies indicate that these complexes dissociate mainly through the spontaneous and proton&#8208;assisted pathways at pH 7.4. The chelator can be readily radiolabeled with [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ at room temperature in 10 min. The radio&#8208;complexes are stable in human serum at 37 &#186;C, in contrast with the analogues of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, which experience significant dissociation under these conditions. Thus, the H4CHXOITAPA chelator represents the most promising candidate among the H4OCTAPA family for the development of 90Y&#8208; and 177Lu&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

Kinetic studies indicate that these complexes dissociate mainly through the spontaneous and proton-assisted pathways at pH 7.4. The chelator can be readily radiolabeled with [90Y]Y3+ and [177Lu]Lu3+ at room temperature in 10 min. The radio-complexes are stable in human serum at 37 &#186;C, in contrast with the analogues of the known H4CHXOCTAPA and H4OCTAPA chelators, which experience significant dissociation under these conditions. Thus, the H4CHXOITAPA chelator represents the most promising candidate among the H4OCTAPA family for the development of 90Y- and 177Lu-based radiopharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Looking to the Future: Prospective Life Cycle Assessment of Emerging Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA), an emerging methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of technologies still in development. Key aspects are identified, including assessing technology maturity levels, upscaling methods, and generating future scenarios. Recent case studies are analyzed to guide researchers in implementing robust pLCA frameworks for emerging technologies.








Abstract
Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to sustainable development, but assessing their future environmental impacts compared to current technologies remains challenging. Prospective life cycle assessment (pLCA) provides a systematic approach to evaluating emerging technologies throughout their life cycle and projecting impacts at future industrial scales. This review aims to identify critical aspects of pLCA methodologies and examine their implementation in recent case studies. Key aspects are highlighted: assessment of initial technology maturity, upscaling methods to model data at higher technology readiness levels, and development of future scenarios to contextualize the scaled&#8208;up systems. Specific upscaling techniques such as process simulation, engineering calculations and technology learning curves are discussed. Approaches to generating future scenarios in line with integrated assessment models and common socio&#8208;economic pathways are also analyzed. An in&#8208;depth literature review covering 2021&#8211;2024 publications categorizes 79 articles into literature reviews, methodological papers and pLCA case studies. The identified critical issues serve as a benchmark to assess the completeness and robustness of 20 case studies. Notable contributions, limitations and the need for comprehensive guidelines that integrate scenario development with upscaling methods are highlighted. This review provides valuable insights for researchers conducting pLCA studies of emerging technologies and materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light photocatalysis provides sustainable and versatile methods for the synthesis and functionalization of chromene derivatives. This review compiles cutting&#8208;edge methodologies, highlighting transformations such as multicomponent reactions, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions, diverse cascade processes, and Giese&#8208;type additions. The integration of photochemistry with green principles enables more convenient and eco&#8208;friendly access to structurally diverse and biologically significant heterocycles.








Abstract
Chromenes represent a biologically significant family of heterocycles, widely present in pharmaceutical compounds and secondary metabolites. Their importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry has driven continuous efforts to develop advanced and efficient synthetic methodologies. Over the past decade, photoredox catalysis has revolutionized Organic Synthesis, offering innovative and sustainable strategies for the construction and functionalization of complex molecules. The synthesis of chromene derivatives has greatly benefited from the integration of visible&#8208;light&#8211;promoted methodologies, which utilize light as an abundant and non&#8208;toxic energy source, enabling greener chemical transformations. In this review, the latest progress in visible&#8208;light&#8211;mediated approaches for the synthesis of chromene derivatives, along with the photochemical reactivity of these relevant frameworks, are summarized.

         <title>Hydrophosphanylation of Alkynes via Magnesium Complexes: Evidence for Ligand Dependency in Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of a well&#8208;defined magnesium complex achieving the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes and alkenes that delivers a cutting&#8208;edge, eco&#8208;friendly solution for crafting vital C&#9472;P bonds efficiently, beyond transition&#8211;metal catalysts.








Abstract
Pursuing practical, straightforward, and sustainable methods for forming carbon&#8208;phosphorus bonds is crucial in academia and industry. In this study, we showed that bis(diiminate)&#8208;based magnesium complexes [L(Mg&#8208;nBu)2] (nBu&#160;=&#160;n&#8208;butyl) could effectively catalyze the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes, resulting in monophosphanylated vinyledene&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;diphosphanylated alkanes in a stepwise manner. This transformation showcases an excellent atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis for organophosphorus compounds. Through controlled experiments and with the support of DFT calculations, we elucidated the reaction mechanism, identifying the active catalytic species and revealing a stepwise hydrophosphanylation process of alkynes. Although complex Mg&#8208;1 showed its potential in this transformation, complexes Mg&#8208;2 and Mg&#8208;3, having ethyl and phenyl spacers, produced a lower yield of hydrophosphanylated products, indicating the role of ligand (spacer) in this catalytic reaction. Further, the activity of Mg&#8208;1 was compared with a monomeric magnesium complex, Mg&#8208;4, and it was found that the performance of the Mg&#8208;4 in alkyne hydrophosphanylation is quite lower than the results obtained by using Mg&#8208;1. This work demonstrated that a dimeric magnesium complex with a suitable spacer can enhance the catalytic activity manyfolds in the hydrophosphanylation of alkynes.

         <title>Synthesis of Selectively 13C/2H/15N&#8208; Labeled Arginine to Probe Protein Conformation and Interaction by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We offer a new labeling approach to introduce isolated 15N&#8722;13C&#8722;1H spin systems to the side chains of arginine residues. The labeling scheme delivers high&#8208;resolution NMR spectra to study large protein complexes. The interaction between ubiquitin and the third Src homology 3 domain of yeast protein Sla1 (Sla1 SH3&#8208;3) has been analyzed, highlighting the probes&#8217; competence to sample rapid dynamics.








Abstract
The charged arginine side chain is unique in determining many innate properties of proteins, contributing to stability and interaction surfaces, and directing allosteric regulation and enzymatic catalysis. NMR experiments can be used to reveal these processes at the molecular level, but it often requires selective insertion of carbon&#8208;13, nitrogen&#8208;15, and deuterium at defined atomic positions. We introduce a method to endow arginine residues with defined isotope patterns, combining synthetic organic chemistry and cell&#8208;based protein overexpression. The resulting proteins feature NMR active spin systems with optimized relaxation pathways leading to simplified NMR spectra with a sensitive response to changes in the chemical environment of the nuclei observed.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Deficient Transition Metal Oxynitrides as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two new oxynitride compounds Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. The anionic vacancy is more easily formed in the Sr3La9V4O7N13 structure, the influence of the defect level on the energy band is stronger, facilitating electron transition in the structure and enhancing electrical conductivity. This study is of great significance to broaden the wide application of transition metal oxynitrides in the field of electronics.








Abstract
Transition metal oxynitrides, with their unique electronic structures and excellent conductivity, hold significant promise as anode materials in fuel cells. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel anion&#8208;deficient transition metal oxynitrides: Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. Their crystal structures were determined via Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data, revealing a higher concentration of anion vacancies in Sr3La9V4O7N13. As a result, Sr3La9V4O7N13 exhibits significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to Ca4La8V4O8N12. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Sr3La9V4O7N13 possesses higher defect formation energies, influencing its band structure and facilitating electron transitions, thereby enhancing conductivity. This study underscores the role of anion deficiencies in modulating the electronic properties of transition metal oxynitrides and offers new insights for designing high&#8208;performance anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).

This study is of great significance to broaden the wide application of transition metal oxynitrides in the field of electronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal oxynitrides, with their unique electronic structures and excellent conductivity, hold significant promise as anode materials in fuel cells. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel anion-deficient transition metal oxynitrides: Ca&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;. Their crystal structures were determined via Rietveld refinement of X-ray and neutron diffraction data, revealing a higher concentration of anion vacancies in Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to Ca&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; possesses higher defect formation energies, influencing its band structure and facilitating electron transitions, thereby enhancing conductivity. This study underscores the role of anion deficiencies in modulating the electronic properties of transition metal oxynitrides and offers new insights for designing high-performance anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Cyclic Imide Extended Diazocines: Tweezer&#8208;Like, Rigid Photoswitches With Large Switching Amplitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitches with a perfect tweezer&#8208;like bending motion and a large amplitude of movement are ideally suited as molecular actuators for applications in photoresponsive materials, biomolecules and photopharmacology. For this purpose, the core of the diazocine photoswitch was extended via cyclic imides. The compounds can be easily synthesized and late&#8208;stage functionalized.








Abstract
Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with improved photophysical properties. One of the main features is the fact that, unlike the azobenzenes, the Z form is more stable than the E isomer. Another important property is the more rigid structure (tricyclic), which precisely defines the molecular movement. The disadvantage of diazocines compared to azobenzenes is the less well&#8208;developed chemistry, particularly regarding the synthesis of derivatives. In this work, we present an approach to preparing diazocine derivatives via a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Two key compounds are used for this purpose: a bis&#8208;anhydride and a bis&#8208;imide of diazocine. They can be further functionalized with both nucleophiles and electrophiles leading to numerous derivatives of diazocine with a large range of functional groups. Due to the extended &#960; systems, the associated larger molecular switching lever, and the defined direction of molecular movement, numerous potential applications in the field of photoswitchable biological systems and photoresponsive materials are conceivable, e.g. photopharmacology, polymer&#8208;based actuators, mechanophores, photoresponsive cages, helicates, MOFs, and COFs.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Reversible Morphological Transitions by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Crystalline&#8208;Coil Polyphosphazene&#8208;b&#8208;Polystyrene (PP&#8208;b&#8208;PS) Block Copolymers</title>

Self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50 in THF yields diverse nanomorphologies (spheres, bicontinuous, toroids, cylinders, vesicles) by varying concentration. PTFEP crystallinity increases with concentration, driving morphological transitions. Unique intermediates (&#8220;flower&#8208;like,&#8221; LCMs, &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221;) reveal transformation mechanisms, showcasing unprecedented structural diversity and control.








Abstract
In this study, we demonstrate that varying the initial concentration of the poly&#8208;[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]&#8208;b&#8208;poly(styrene) (PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50) block copolymer enables the formation of diverse, well&#8208;defined nanomorphologies through self&#8208;assembly in tetrahydrofuran (THF). By adjusting the copolymer concentration, spherical micelles (0.1&#160;mg/mL), bicontinuous micelles (0.33&#160;mg/mL), toroidal micelles (2.0&#160;mg/mL), cylindrical micelles (10&#160;mg/mL), and vesicles (50&#160;mg/mL) were successfully prepared. This simple methodology, using a single solvent and no additives, allowed for the investigation of morphological transformation mechanisms. Intermediate structures, such as &#8220;flower&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies (0.66&#160;mg/mL), large compound micelles (LCMs, 1.0&#160;mg/mL), and perforated micelles (1.5&#160;mg/mL), were identified, revealing transitions between bicontinuous and toroidal morphologies. In situ studies captured the opening of toroidal structures into cylindrical micelles, while &#8220;octopi&#8208;like&#8221; structures were observed at intermediate concentrations between cylindrical and vesicular architectures. Wide&#8208;angle x&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis showed that PTFEP blocks in the nanostructure cores are amorphous at low concentrations (&lt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL) but exhibit increasing crystallinity at higher concentrations (&gt;&#160;2&#160;mg/mL), transitioning from toroidal to cylindrical and vesicular morphologies. This work highlights the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of PTFEP&#8208;b&#8208;PS, generating a wide range of nanomorphologies by modulating PTFEP crystallinity through concentration adjustments. The unprecedented structural diversity of this system underscores its potential for designing advanced nanostructured materials.

         <title>A Fluorescent Aptasensor for Sensitive and Selective Determination of Epigenetic Cancer Biomarker N1&#8208;methyladenosine in Urine Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) level in urine increases in the presence of cancer and is associated with the tumor size and stage. In the present study, we aimed to develop a method for rapid, sensitive and accurate determination of m1A in urine samples. The capture SELEX method was used to isolate aptamers that could selectively bind to m1A. We successfully isolated two sequences that have high selectivity towards m1A. The affinities against m1A were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thioflavin T (ThT) assays. The N1MA1a aptamer has a Kd of 1.9&#177;0.1 &#181;M determined by the ThT assay and 0.75&#177;0.04 &#181;M determined by ITC. A strand&#8208;displacement biosensor was designed by labeling the aptamer with fluorescein and hybridizing it with a quencher&#8208;labeled complementary DNA strand. Using this biosensing system, m1A was detected with a detection limit of 1.9 &#181;M. The system shows high selectivity to m1A and high tolerance to adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and N6&#8208;methyladenosine as well as urine constituents at their real levels in urine. The sensor has been applied to five different human urine samples showing quantitative recovery values, which indicates practical potential of this aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;N1-methyladenosine (m1A) level in urine increases in the presence of cancer and is associated with the tumor size and stage. In the present study, we aimed to develop a method for rapid, sensitive and accurate determination of m1A in urine samples. The capture SELEX method was used to isolate aptamers that could selectively bind to m1A. We successfully isolated two sequences that have high selectivity towards m1A. The affinities against m1A were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thioflavin T (ThT) assays.

         <title>Making and Breaking Supramolecular Synthons for Modular Protein Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic calixarenes are useful mediators of protein assembly. In some cases, protein &#8211; calixarene cocrystallization yields multiple polymorphs. Ralstonia solanacearum lectin (RSL) cocrystallizes with p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[8]arene (sclx8) in at least four distinct pH&#8208;dependent arrangements. One of these polymorphs, occurring at pH &#8804;4, is a cubic framework in which RSL nodes are connected by sclx8 dimers. These dimers are supramolecular synthons, occurring in distinct crystal structures. Now, we show that the discus&#8208;shaped dimer of p&#8208;phosphonato&#8208;calix[6]arene (pclx6), can replace the sclx8 dimer yielding a new assembly of RSL. Remarkably, just one type of RSL &#8211; pclx6 cocrystal was formed, irrespective of pH or crystallization condition. These results with pclx6 contrast starkly with sclx8 and suggest that the calixarene type (e.g. phosphonate versus sulfonate) dictates the synthon durability, which in turn exerts control over protein assembly and polymorph selection. Breaking the pclx6 dimer required a mutant of RSL with an affinity tag for macrocycle binding. This highly accessible, dicationic site resulted in a significantly altered and porous framework with pclx6 (but not with sclx8). Experiments with ternary mixtures of RSL, pclx6 and sclx8 provide evidence of pH&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting. Thus, the &#8216;mix&#8208;and&#8208;match&#8217; of protein and supramolecular synthons is a promising approach to protein crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride with Cerium&#8208;Aluminum Catalytic Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a cerium&#8208;aluminum bimetallic catalyst is fired using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, and a modified carbon fabric anode is created. Electrochemical degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride without additional oxidizing agents shows excellent results. Simultaneously, several cycle degradation studies yield outstanding results, and a degradation mechanism was presented by characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85&#8201;% removal efficiency of DOX within 2&#8197;hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82&#8201;%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8211;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hydroquinolines from Nitroaldehydes and Ketones by Hydrogenation Sequences and Condensations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a novel complex chemical reaction namely the synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes and ketones and hydrogen. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed condensation leading to a quinoline intermediate and selective quinoline hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic reaction discovery or methodology development is preferably performed with homogeneous catalysts, but heterogeneous catalysts allow the design of complex multistep syntheses based on their reusability. We introduce here the catalytic synthesis of hydroquinolines starting from nitroaldehydes, ketones and hydrogen. The reaction is complex and proceeds via multiple selective hydrogenation and condensation steps. The nitroaldehyde is selectively hydrogenated forming an aminoaldehyde, followed by a base&#8208;catalyzed Friedl&#228;nder synthesis and selective quinoline hydrogenation. The starting materials are inexpensive, simple regarding their structure and diversely available, and the hydroquinoline motif is part of numerous biologically active compounds. A nanostructured earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst mediates our reaction most efficiently.

Abstract
In this work, we present for the first time an innovative strategy to construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors through the synergistic optimization of vanadium&#8208;doped self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional Flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anodes and SnO&#8322;/CNTs composite anodes. The V&#8208;doped Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode synthesized by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method combines vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies, lattice distortion effects and self&#8208;supporting properties of the three&#8208;dimensional floral structure, which enhances the specific surface area of the material to 190.58&#8197;m2/g, and obtains a high specific capacitance of 2,157&#8197;F/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g, and undergoes a 15&#8197;A/g After 10,000 cycles at 15&#8197;A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still 98.2&#8201;%. To address the limitations of traditional anode materials, SnO&#8322;/CNTs composites significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance (5.61&#8197;&#937;) and enhance the multiplicity performance by combining the high theoretical capacity of SnO&#8322; with the three&#8208;dimensional conductive network of CNTs. Based on this, the V&#8722;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs hybrid supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 151&#8197;Wh/kg at 3&#8197;A/g, which is a 30&#8211;60&#8201;% enhancement over the conventional molybdate capacitor, and maintains 96.2&#8201;% capacitance stability after 10,000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the development of energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycle life.

         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method is developed for the hydrofunctionalization of olefins, involving TEMPO adduct formation followed by photocatalytic nucleophilic substitution. This approach enables the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bonds with high efficiency. The method demonstrates potential for PET applications with hydrofluorination and offers an alternative pathway to diastereoselective olefin hydration.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.

         <title>Molecular Recognition and Chiral Discrimination from NMR and Multi&#8208;Scale Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the enantioselective discrimination of mandelic acid enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. The findings provide a detailed understanding of the diffusion properties and binding interactions that drive chiral recognition at the molecular level.








Abstract
Chiral molecules are particularly interesting to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors due to their chemical and physical properties. Separation and identification of enantiomers are critical for a broad range of compounds, and discriminating stereoisomers in solution remains a key analytical challenge. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (MAD), in the presence of chiral resolving agents, has emerged as a tool to explore these chiral mixtures. However, insight into the intermolecular interactions that lead to chiral recognition is still limited. Here, we combine experimental MAD studies with computational approaches to investigate the enantioselective discrimination of Mandelic Acid (MA) enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL. Molecular dynamics simulations explain the differences in diffusion coefficients for heterochiral complexes. Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations confirmed enantioselective binding preferences due to differences in Gibbs free energies, highlighting the fundamental interactions and structural criteria that explain the NMR shielding and the diffusion trends. This integrated approach bridges experimental and theoretical studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms and elucidating the observed heterochiral preference of BINOL for MA enantiomers. Our findings advance the field of chiral analysis and lay a foundation for future developments for identifying stereoisomers and recognition modes underlying enantioselective binding.

         <title>Slight&#8208;Crosslinking: Opening a New Journey for the Intrinsic Elastification of Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of ferroelectric polymers, slight&#8208;crosslinking techniques have emerged as a crucial innovation, opening new avenues for the advancement of elastic electronics. This paper provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of diverse crosslinking methodologies, such as diamine crosslinking, carbene reaction, thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, and peroxide crosslinking. It reviews the key achievements in this field and highlights potential future research directions for further development.








Abstract
Elastic electronic materials are essential components in the next generation of wearable devices and soft robots. However, the development of elastic ferroelectric materials has lagged behind that of conductive and semiconductive materials. The successful realization of intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics through slight&#8208;crosslinking has opened a new path for making ferroelectric materials elastic. Given the critical need for materials that combine excellent elasticity with robust ferroelectric properties in the field of elastic electronics, we explore various crosslinking techniques and their performance characteristics. We believe that this cutting&#8208;edge research direction holds substantial value for both fundamental studies and practical applications.

         <title>Photocleavage and Photophysical Properties of Amine Releasing BODIPY Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper introduces the synthesis, structural studies, photophysical properties, and photocleavage studies of three novel green light cleavable boron dipyrromethene&#160;(BODIPY) derivatives with varying sizes of aromatic terminal groups. All BODIPY derivatives have similar spectroscopical properties. Photocleavage studies in different conditions revealed that amine release depends on the presence of oxygen, concentration, and the nature of the amine to be released.








Abstract
To date, there is still a lack of suitable methods for chemical modification of graphene surfaces in situ. Photocleavable compounds have great potential for in situ modification of chemical species with visible light, leaving desired chemical functionalities on the surface. Green light&#8208;sensitive boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives can release diverse cargos, including biologically important amines. In this study, green light&#8208;sensitive photocleavable BODIPY derivatives with different aromatic anchors for surface binding were designed and synthesized with the ultimate goal of selective graphene surface patterning. The effects of different aromatic anchor groups on photocleaving capability, their structural and photophysical properties and photocleavage in different conditions were studied. Photocleavage was significantly faster, and more controllable photoreaction was achieved in inert conditions than in the presence of oxygen (ambient air). In addition, pyrene as an anchor lowered fluorescence quantum yield and intensities of absorption and emission maxima of the entire BODIPY derivative, making it a poorer fluorophore than the derivatives with the naphthalene and phenyl anchors.

         <title>The Use of Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Synthesis of Iron Oxides Nanoparticles: A Driving Force for Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) structurally directed the growth of technologically relevant Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs) towards magnetic (magnetite) or non&#8208;magnetic (hematite) crystal structures, according to their intrinsic properties.








Abstract
In this study, we explored the use of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as a green and sustainable alternative for the synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs). Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. In addition, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR&#8208;MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA&#8208;HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8322;O&#8323;).

&lt;p&gt;Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) structurally directed the growth of technologically relevant Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs) towards magnetic (magnetite) or non-magnetic (hematite) crystal structures, according to their intrinsic properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the use of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as a green and sustainable alternative for the synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs). Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. In addition, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR-MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA-HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;-Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings established a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AgNO&#8323; and FeCl&#8323; relay&#8208;catalyzed halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction of terminal aryl alkynols provides a step&#8208;efficient regio&#8208; and chemoselective synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields.








Abstract
Herein, we report an AgNO3 and FeCl3 relay&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and electrophilic selenium cyclization reaction. This reaction is based on the trifunctionalization of terminal alkynols using NBS and diorganyl diselenides, providing a step&#8208;efficient synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields. Furthermore, the halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction offers an efficient protocol for constructing molecules with two independent reactive centers.

         <title>The Redox Cycle of Viologen&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active moiety of MV2+ was introduced into POPs. As a strong electron acceptor, MV2+ can rapidly capture electrons, promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency for H2O2 production. TPE&#8208;MV demonstrated excellent performance in photocatalytic water splitting, highlighting the crucial role of MV2+ in the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important strategy to address the current energy shortage. Among various materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) stand out as promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 generation due to their versatile structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation; however, their efficiency in H2O2 synthesis is often constrained by poor charge separation and high reaction energy barriers. To address these challenges, we drew inspiration from the redox reactions of coenzyme NADPH in natural photosynthesis, the redox&#8208;active methyl viologen (MV2+) moiety was rationally incorporated into two polymer frameworks (TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV) as pivotal active sites for photocatalytic oxygen (O2) reduction to H2O2 via the reversible redox cycle of MV2+ and zerovalent methyl viologen (MV0). Through this redox cycle, MV2&#8314; accepts two photogenerated electrons, reducing it to MV&#8304;. MV&#8304; sequentially reduces O&#8322; to H&#8322;O&#8322; while regenerating MV2&#8314;. Mechanistic studies show that this approach effectively suppresses charge recombination and lowers the reaction energy barriers. Consequently, the photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation rates of TPE&#8208;MV and TPB&#8208;MV reached 6068 and 2015&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;, respectively. This work offers a new strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts by incorporating biomimetic redox&#8208;active moieties to enhance solar energy utilization for H2O2 production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functioning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Methotrexate&#8208;Loaded Gadolinium MOFs as Drug Carriers and Radiosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores gadolinium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as dual&#8208;functional platforms for anticancer drug delivery and radiosensitization. Synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate, Gd&#8208;MOFs were loaded with methotrexate (MTX) and characterized via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). In vitro studies on A549 and BEAS&#8208;2B cells under radiotherapy demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells, highlighting their potential for selective therapy. The findings support Gd&#8208;MOFs as promising candidates for combinatory cancer treatments, improving therapeutic efficacy. The graphical summary illustrates their role in drug delivery, MRI imaging, and radiosensitization. 








Abstract
Cancer remains a critical global health challenge, necessitating advanced drug delivery systems through innovations in materials science and nanotechnology. This study evaluates gadolinium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Gd&#8208;MOFs) as potential drug delivery systems for anticancer therapy, particularly when combined with radiotherapy. Gd&#8208;MOFs were synthesized using terephthalic acid and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate and then loaded with methotrexate (MTX). Characterization via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed their correct structure and stability. Effective MTX loading and controlled release were demonstrated. Anticancer effects were assessed on human healthy bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS&#8208;2B) and human lung cancer cells (A549) using the 3&#8208;(4,5&#8208;dimethylthiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay under in vitro radiation therapy. MTX/Gd&#8208;MOF combined with radiotherapy showed a greater reduction in cancer cell viability (41.89%&#160;&#177;&#160;2.75 for A549) compared to healthy cells (56.80%&#160;&#177;&#160;1.97 for BEAS&#8208;2B), indicating selective cytotoxicity. These findings highlight the potential of Gd&#8208;MOFs not only as drug delivery vehicles but also as radiosensitizers, enhancing radiotherapy efficacy and offering promising evidence for their use in combinatory cancer therapies to improve treatment outcomes.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8211;Induced Multicolor and Thermochromic Emissions of Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two triphenylamine derivatives exhibited distinct fluorescence behaviors under stimuli such as mechanical grinding, heat, and solvents. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds, as well as hydrogen bonds with solvents, were responsible for their stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties. Regulating the rigidity through hydrogen bonding offers a feasible strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
The fluorescence tuning of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials is crucial but challenging. The deep understanding of thermal induced fluorescence change, however, has rarely been conducted. Herein, the thermochromic emission of a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative (1), with one acetyl and two 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl units on each o&#8208;phenyl group around the nitrogen atom, has been investigated. Upon heating, the bright blue&#8208;emitting solid 1 turns to a strong green&#8208;emitting liquid. Moreover, 1 is green emissive in ethanol but blue emissive with high absolute quantum yields in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Another TPA derivative (2) is green emitting. X&#8208;ray crystallography studies reveal that the strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence arises from a rigid pyramidal structure around central nitrogen of 1, due to the OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;OH, OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#160;=&#160;C hydrogen bonding interactions. Comparatively, 2 has a planar configuration of three C&#9472;N bonds around central nitrogen atom. This work will provide a new route for constructing multiemission materials using unimolecular platforms.

         <title>Thermodynamic Water Activity Explains the Unusual Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the activity of water in pure solvents and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), its deviation from classical thermodynamic models like Raoult's law, and its impact on electrochemical stability of DESs.








Abstract
The presence of water in nonaqueous deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolytes has been debated in recent years, with efforts ranging from its complete removal to willful addition. It was shown that controlled amounts of water can be beneficial, as it not only enhances the physicochemical properties of these electrolytes but also has no significant detrimental effects on their electrochemical stability. Despite these advantages, there is still limited understanding of how water interacts with DES systems at the molecular level. This study examines the water activity in ethylene glycol and glycerol, as well as their binary mixtures with choline chloride to form the DESs ethaline and glyceline, respectively. In this work, we show that the high electrochemical stability of glyceline is related to its lower water activity compared to ethaline and can be attributed to the robust H&#8208;bonding network formed by the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol. Its 3D H&#8208;bond network effectively integrates water molecules within its solvent structure, reducing degradation and maintaining stability at higher water contents. The deviations from the ideal Raoult's law behavior are reflected in the water activity and activity coefficients, which highlight the intricate H&#8208;bond interactions within DES&#8208;water mixtures. Water acts like a lubricant within the more viscous DES mixtures without being detrimental to their electrochemical performance. The presented results emphasize the necessity of customizing DES&#8208;water compositions to enhance their performance as electrolytes, especially in flow battery applications where electrochemical stability, ionic conductivity, and fluidity are of utmost importance.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmetalation from boron onto beryllium was observed. This reaction is triggered through steric overcrowding of the beryllium atom or reducing the ligand beryllium bond strength through oxidation of the ligating phosphorus atoms.








Abstract
Investigation of tris(di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphosphanylmethyl)phenylborate ([TP(iPr)]&#8722;) organo&#8208;beryllium complexes [TP(iPr)]BeR with R&#160;=&#160;Ph, nBu, Cp, Cp* revealed transmetalation of [CH2P(iPr)2]&#8722; groups from boron onto beryllium. This reaction is caused by partial dissociation of the scorpionate, which can be triggered through steric overcrowding of the beryllium atom or reducing the ligand beryllium bond strength through oxidation of the phosphorus atoms with selenium.

         <title>Catalytic Production of Aromatic Amines from Nitroaromatics&#8212;Addressing a Critical Challenge in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the continuous&#8208;flow reduction of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) into valuable aromatic amines, addressing environmental and industrial challenges. Key topics include reactor designs such as microreactors and packed&#8208;bed systems, advanced catalysts like bimetallic nanoparticles, and emerging trends like hybrid photocatalysis. The work emphasizes transforming toxic NAC waste into fine chemical products, aligning with Circular Economy principles.








Abstract
The present work reviews the continuous&#8208;flow hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) to aromatic amines, highlighting its significance in sustainable chemical manufacturing. These processes offer enhanced efficiency, scalability, and safety compared to traditional batch methods, addressing the environmental concerns associated with NACs contamination. In this context, the flow&#8208;mode processes of NACs hydrogenation may be considered as tools for catalytically driven extraction of fine chemical products. Within this review, key aspects, including an overview of flow reactor designs&#8212;such as packed&#8208;bed and microreactors&#8212;optimizing heat and mass transfer are discussed. Additionally, various catalytic materials, including bimetallic nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are explored for their improved stability and selectivity in NACs reduction. The kinetics of these reactions aids in understanding the factors affecting reaction, and mass transfer rates. Despite the advantages, challenges remain, including catalyst deactivation and reactor design complexities, particularly during scale&#8208;up for industrial applications. Future trends indicate a shift toward hybrid systems integrating photocatalysis and biocatalysis, enhancing the versatility of continuous&#8208;flow processes. Ultimately, the adoption of these technologies is anticipated to play a crucial role in the circular economy by converting hazardous waste into valuable products, thereby fostering innovation and environmental preservation in the chemical industry.

         <title>Frosted DNA: &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase Control of Oligonucleotide Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;Galactosidase is expressed at low level in many native cells and strongly upregulated in senescent cells. In the present study, we use &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity as internal trigger to control the hybridization of oligonucleotides&#8211;eventually selective in senescent cells.








ABSTRACT
We introduce a novel approach for the control of oligonucleotides through enzymatic activation with &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal). We use the well&#8208;known enzymatic capability of &#946;&#8208;gal to hydrolyze the &#946;&#8208;galactosidic bond combined with a self&#8208;immolative linker and present three ways of steric or topological blocking of a DNA oligonucleotide. Through a series of in vitro experiments with &#946;&#8208;gal variants (recombinant or from human cell lysates), we systematically investigate stability, transitory perturbation, and enzymatic activation. Our approach holds significant promise for applications related to senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal activity, including targeted modulation of gene expression and programmable molecular interventions. The combination of enzymatic activation applied to oligonucleotides represents a significant advance for targeted release in affected cells without the need for external triggering.

         <title>Activation and Fixation of Atmospheric CO2 through a 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Based Mesoionic Carbene&#8211;Borane Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;based mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8211;borane compound captures atmospheric CO2 and converts it into formate. The rate and product formation of CO2 reduction is seen to be strongly dependent on the CO2 source with both formate and bicarbonate being produced with the same MIC&#8211;borane compound. A battery of spectroscopic methods was used to investigate the intermediates and understand the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Capturing atmospheric CO2 and converting it to valuable chemicals are important goals in contemporary science. We present here a simple, transition metal&#8208;free triazolylidene&#8211;borane adduct that can capture atmospheric CO2 and convert it to formate. Several key intermediates were isolated and characterized by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

&lt;p&gt;A triazole-based mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8211;borane compound captures atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and converts it into formate. The rate and product formation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction is seen to be strongly dependent on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source with both formate and bicarbonate being produced with the same MIC&#8211;borane compound. A battery of spectroscopic methods was used to investigate the intermediates and understand the underlying mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capturing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and converting it to valuable chemicals are important goals in contemporary science. We present here a simple, transition metal-free triazolylidene&#8211;borane adduct that can capture atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and convert it to formate. Several key intermediates were isolated and characterized by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction. A first closed cycle for the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formic acid by using the aforementioned triazolylidene&#8211;borane compound is presented as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Performances of Carbon&#8208;Based Tetrel Bond Catalysis by Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysis via density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). The bowl&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit acts as the primary catalytic active site in catalyzing Micheal addition reaction, surpassing 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in cyclopropane derivatives. Electron&#8208;withdrawing group modifications significantly enhance catalytic efficacy, with stronger groups yielding superior performance. ML models are employed to rapidly predict catalyst performance, offering a streamlined strategy for designing efficient tetrel bond catalysts.








Abstract
The non&#8208;covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics. In recent years, the carbon&#8208;based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure&#8208;property relationship of carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism and new insight into the catalytic active site are introduced based on the DFT&#8208;calculated results. The bowl&#8208;like 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;&#8208;hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity and provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of Bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF for OER and HER Through a Synergistic Bimetallic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CoNi&#8208;bimetallic MOF was synthesized alongside its monometallic counterparts, Co(II)&#8208;MOF and Ni(II)&#8208;MOF, using 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid as the ligand. The bimetallic MOF exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, it demonstrated excellent stability over 1000 cycles, attributed to the synergistic effect of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions and the hydrogen bonding within the structure.








Abstract
Due to the decreasing availability, reduced stability, and high cost of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, the search for stable, efficient, and inexpensive electrocatalysts is of significant importance. In this study, three new isostructural Co(II), Ni(II), and CoNi metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on bis&#8208;coordinating ligand 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid are explored as efficient electrocatalysts. The structure of CoNi&#8208;MOF was further confirmed by various experimental techniques. The electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) revealed that the bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF demonstrated significantly greater activity towards OER and HER compared to its monometallic counterparts, Co&#8208;MOF and Ni&#8208;MOF. CoNi&#8208;MOF requires 350 mV and 150 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. Moreover, they exhibited excellent stability for 6 hours and 1000 OER cycles, demonstrating its superiority in these reactions. The significant enhancement in the performance of CoNi&#8208;MOF is attributed to the bimetallic synergistic effects between the redox&#8208;active metal centers Co2+ and Ni2+, which increase the activity of the catalyst's surface, resulting in enhanced current density and reduced overpotential. The hydrogen bond between coordinated water molecules and un&#8208;coordinated carboxylate is essential for the electrochemical stability of the materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteroleptic Amidinato Calcium Halides via the In&#8208;Situ Grignard Addition Method (iGAM) Complementing the Metalation of Amidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ generation of Grignard&#8208;type organocalcium reagents via the reduction of alkyl and aryl halides in THF and their immediate use for subsequent addition onto carbodiimides allows the synthesis of hitherto unknown amidinates of calcium.








Abstract
The in&#8208;situ Grignard addition method adds intermediately prepared organo alkaline&#8208;earth metal halides onto a suitable substrate. Here, freshly rasped calcium and the carbodiimide R&#8242;&#9472;N&#9552;C&#9552;N&#9472;R&#8242; (R&#8242; = SiMe3, iPr) are suspended in THF at room temperature and then an organyl halide R&#9472;X (X = Br, I) is added. Within several hours, intermediately formed R&#9472;Ca&#9472;X adds onto the carbodiimide yielding the corresponding thf adducts of the amidinato calcium halide {(R&#8242;N)2C&#9472;R}CaX. Suitable organyl halides besides aryl iodide are methyl and ethyl halide whereas bulkier isopropyl and tert&#8208;butyl iodides give very low yields.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Electrolyte Enables Planar Cu Deposition and High&#8208;Temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte composed of choline chloride and urea exhibits superior high&#8208;temperature resistance compared with the aqueous electrolyte. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#8211;MnO2 full cell with the DES electrolyte is able to maintain a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, demonstrating great potential for application under harsh conditions. 








Abstract
Cu anodes exhibit a higher theoretical specific capacity (843 mAh g&#8722;1 or 7558 mAh cm&#8722;3) than Zn anodes (820 mAh g&#8722;1 or 5855 mAh cm&#8722;3), and have garnered widespread attention. However, aqueous Cu&#8208;ion batteries suffer from severe Cu dendrite growth, limited cycle life, and poor high&#8208;temperature performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolyte is proposed to address these issues. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the DES electrolyte coordinates with Cu2+, thereby modulating the Cu deposition behavior. Consequently, planar deposition and extended cycle life (6000&#160;h versus 730&#160;h) are achieved. Furthermore, the DES electrolyte exhibits the promising application potential under harsh conditions. A high&#8208;temperature Cu&#9472;MnO2 full cell retains a capacity of 174.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 under 50 &#176;C.
