         <title>Synthesis of Silylated Cyclobutanone and Cyclobutene Derivatives Involving 1,4&#8208;Addition of Zinc&#8208;Based Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly substituted cyclobutenones undergoes 1,4&#8208;addition with zinc&#8208;based nucleophiles with and, for non&#8208;hindered acceptors, without the aid of a copper catalyst. The intermediate metal enolate can be trapped as an enol phosphate and further reacted with Grignard reagents in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By this, a range of silylated cyclobutanone and cyclobutene derivatives becomes accessible.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate silylation of various cyclobutenone derivatives with Me2PhSiZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or (Me2PhSi)2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xLiCl (x&#8804;4) to generate &#946;&#8208;silylated cyclobutanones is reported. Trapping the intermediate enolate with ClP(O)(OPh)2 affords silylated enol phosphates that can be further engaged in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions to yield silylated cyclobutene derivatives.

         <title>Investigation on Optical and Biological Properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole Based Cycloplatinated Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible photosensitizers: Mono&#8208; and dinuclear cycloplatinated complexes featuring the donor&#8211;acceptor 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazolyl ligand (Me2N&#8208;pbt) and biologically active phosphines show dual emission and photoinduced phosphorescence generating 1O2, with potential applications in theranostics and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The optical and biological properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole cycloplatinated complexes featuring bioactive ligands ([{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}L] [L=Me2N&#8208;pbtH 1, p&#8208;dpbH (4&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 2, o&#8208;dpbH (2&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 3), [Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(o&#8208;dpb)] 4, [{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}2(&#956;&#8208;PRnP)] [PR4P=O(CH2CH2OC(O)C6H4PPh2)2 5, PR12P=O{(CH2CH2O)3C(O)C6H4PPh2}2 6] are presented. Complexes 1&#8211;6 display 1ILCT and metal&#8208;perturbed 3ILCT dual emissions. The ratio between both bands is excitation dependent, accomplishing warm&#8208;white emissions for 2, 5 and 6. The phosphorescent emission is lost in aerated solutions owing to photoinduced electron transfer to 3O2 and the formation of 1O2, as confirmed in complexes 2 and 4. They also exhibit photoinduced phosphorescence enhancement in non&#8208;degassed DMSO due to local oxidation of DMSO by sensitized 1O2, which causes a local degassing. Me2N&#8208;pbtH and the complexes specifically accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, although only 2, 3 and 6 were active against A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines, 6 being highly selective in respect to nontumoral cells. The potential photodynamic property of these complexes was demonstrated with complex 4.

         <title>Mirror Symmetry Breaking and Network Formation in Achiral Polycatenars with Thioether Tail</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous mirror&#8208;symmetry breaking. Achiral multichain &#960;&#8208;conjugated rod&#8208;like molecules form a series of chiral and achiral liquid crystalline networks as well as mirror symmetry broken liquids. The effect of thioalkyl chains on helical self&#8208;assembly and network formation is discussed.







Abstract
Mirror symmetry breaking in systems composed of achiral molecules is of importance for the design of functional materials for technological applications as well as for the understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous emergence of chirality. Herein, we report the design and molecular self&#8208;assembly of two series of rod&#8208;like achiral polycatenar molecules derived from a &#960;&#8208;conjugated 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene core with a fork&#8208;like triple alkoxylated end and a variable single alkylthio chain at the other end. In both series of liquid crystalline materials, differing in the chain length at the trialkoxylated end, helical self&#8208;assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated rods in networks occurs, leading to wide temperature ranges (&gt;200&#8197;K) of bicontinuous cubic network phases, in some cases being stable even around ambient temperatures. The achiral bicontinuous cubic Ia
d phase (gyroid) is replaced upon alkylthio chain elongation by a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken bicontinuous cubic phase (I23) and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso1[*]). Further chain elongation results in removing the I23 phase and the re&#8208;appearance of the Ia
d phase with different pitch lengths. In the second series an additional tetragonal phase separates the two cubic phase types.

         <title>Abrupt Spin&#8208;State Switching in Mn(III) Complexes with BPh4&#160;Anion: Effect of Halide Substituents on Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three tetraphenylborates of mononuclear Mn(III) cation complexes with hexadentate ligands, the products of the reaction between a N,N&#162;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropyl)ethylenediamine and salicylaldehydes with the different haloid substitutions at the 5 or 3,5 positions, have been synthesized: [Mn(5&#8208;F&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  1  ), [Mn(3,5&#8208;diCl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  2  ) and [Mn(3,5&#8208;Br,Cl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  3  ). Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (e) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (  1  ) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high&#8208;spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low&#8208;spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes  2  and  3  are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties.

Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (e) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (  1  ) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high-spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low-spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes  2  and  3  are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties. Complex  2  demonstrates two structural phase transitions related to sharp spin crossovers from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase&#160;at 137 K and from the intermediate phase&#160;to the LS at 87 K, while complex  3  exhibits only one spin transition from the HS to the&#160;HS:LS intermediate phase at 83 K.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>

Vulnerable? The activity and functional group tolerance of metal alkylidyne canopy catalysts for alkyne metathesis is excellent, but their stability leaves room for optimization. The search for the Achilles&#8242; heels unveiled a new decomposition pathway through bimolecular coupling and led to the discovery of a facile cyclo&#8208;tetramerization reaction by (reversible) opening of the tripodal ligand cage.







Abstract
Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex 1&#8201;a endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is the most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway that engages the Mo&#8801;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple&#8208;bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#8801;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex, 8, with a Mo&#8801;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques, 95Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex 6, endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework, is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Hydrogen and Halogen Bonding in Homogeneous External Electric Fields: Modulating the Bond Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14042-14050, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensitivity of single and multiple hydrogen (H) and halogen (X) bonding to external electric fields (EEFs) was analyzed. Computations show that the variations of X&#8208;bonds mainly stem from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect governs the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference from H&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. The sensitivity in multiple&#8208;bonding cases can be regulated by the permutations of noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both ab initio valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change to EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8722;95.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at the EEF strength 0.005&#8197;a.u.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of the Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14092-14099, October 7, 2021. </description>

Acid&#8208;mediated activation of an S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxide allows for the cyclization of peptides through metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation of arenes. The less electrophilic S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine sulfoxide serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of nucleophilic cysteine in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride under acidic conditions. It is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization, which results in the synthesis of an Amatoxin derivative and stapled peptide possessing a tryptathionine structure.







Abstract
Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapled peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol, which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of a thioether linkage between tryptophan and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapled peptides possessing the Cys&#8208;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less&#8208;electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of a Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.

         <title>Static Retention of Dynamic Chiral Arrangements for Achiral Shear Thinning Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids</title>

Spin doctoring: Shear thinning is suggested to help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in a vortex, which results in strong CD properties. Furthermore, the introduction of a small molecule that both undergoes electrostatic interaction and possesses dual&#8208;site coordination bonding ability will greatly increase the storage modulus of colloids and make them maintain dynamic CD properties in the static state.







Abstract
Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because they are the fundamental components of living organisms, but also for their unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by using chiral physical fields, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between dynamic chiroptical properties and rheological nature is discussed, suggesting the shear thinning properties of non&#8208;Newtonian fluids might help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in vortices. Furthermore, the storage modulus of colloids could be increased by adding a linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical properties in the static state. Moreover, the salt effect on the host&#8211;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, the results suggested a significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.

Furthermore, the introduction of a small molecule that both undergoes electrostatic interaction and possesses dual-site coordination bonding ability will greatly increase the storage modulus of colloids and make them maintain dynamic CD properties in the static state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because they are the fundamental components of living organisms, but also for their unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by using chiral physical fields, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between dynamic chiroptical properties and rheological nature is discussed, suggesting the shear thinning properties of non-Newtonian fluids might help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in vortices. Furthermore, the storage modulus of colloids could be increased by adding a linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical properties in the static state. Moreover, the salt effect on the host&#8211;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, the results suggested a significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Treating a germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair, 1, with trichlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony allowed the isolation of oxidative addition products. Reduction of these compounds with sodium metal or LiBHEt3 led to the synthesis of a phosphinidene, an arsinidene and a stibinidene. After halide abstraction, a germaphosphene, 8, was isolated, and its 31P NMR data were analyzed by using quantum chemical calculations. The product of an Al&#8722;H addition was found upon treating the phosphinidene with [iBu2AlH]2.







Abstract
The reaction of the intramolecular germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4GeAr* (1) with Group 15 element trichlorides ECl3 (E=P, As, Sb) was investigated. After oxidative addition, the resulting compounds (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)ECl2 (2: E=P, 3: E=As, 4: E=Sb) were reduced by using sodium metal or LiHBEt3. The molecular structures of the phosphine&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)P (5), arsinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)As (6) and stibinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)Sb (7) are presented; they feature a two&#8208;coordinate low&#8208;valent Group 15 element. After chloride abstraction, a cyclic germaphosphene [(o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)GeP] [B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (8) was isolated. The 31P NMR data of the germaphosphene were compared with literature examples and analyzed by quantum chemical calculations. The phosphinidene was treated with [iBu2AlH]2, and the product of an Al&#8722;H addition to the low&#8208;valent phosphorus atom (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(H)P(H)Al(C4H9)2 (9) was characterized.

         <title>Investigation of Masked N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;isocyanates: Support for Oxadiazolones as Blocked N&#8208;Isocyanate Precursors</title>

Masked synthesis: N&#8208;isocyanates are reactive intermediates and their N&#8208;acyl derivatives, amido&#8208;isocyanates, are rare. Herein, their synthesis and reactivity are studied, supporting that under suitable conditions the amido&#8208;isocyanate is in equilibrium with the parent oxadiazolone. Reactions with amino&#8208;amides as nucleophiles form nitrogen&#8208;rich products, either aza&#8208;tripeptides or their parent hydantoins. Support for an isocyanate intermediate was also obtained using carboxylate ions as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazides.







Abstract
In contrast to carbon&#8208;substituted isocyanates that are common building blocks, N&#8208;substituted isocyanates remain underdeveloped and reports on their N&#8208;acyl derivatives (i.&#8201;e. amido&#8208;isocyanates) are exceedingly rare. Herein, amido&#8208;isocyanates were investigated in the context of syntheses of aza&#8208;tripeptide and hydantoins subunits starting from simple bench&#8208;stable precursors. A key finding is that the amido&#8208;isocyanate formed in&#8197;situ cyclized to yield an oxadiazolone, and that under suitable reaction conditions this heterocycle is a traceless blocked (masked) N&#8208;isocyanate. Using organic bases as catalysts and upon heating, oxadiazolone formation is observed, and various nucleophiles to provide the desired aza&#8208;dipeptides or hydantoins in moderate to high yields. Further support for an amido&#8208;isocyanate intermediate was obtained using carboxylic acids as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazide products.

Amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs.







Abstract
Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.

         <title>Efficient Entropy&#8208;Driven Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase III by Hydroxyethylene Transition&#8208;State Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14108-14120, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;state&#8208;based inhibitor has been developed which efficiently inhibits the metalloprotease dipeptidylpeptidase 3 (DPP3) by releasing structured water molecules from the binding cleft.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, it could be shown that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors is reported, using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#956;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.

         <title>Mechanochromic Luminescence (MCL) of Purely Organic Two&#8208;Component Dyes: Wide&#8208;Range MCL over 300&#8197;nm and Two&#8208;Step MCL by Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation</title>

Two components, two steps: Control over the mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of a dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine was achieved using a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach. Wide&#8208;range MCL with a solid&#8208;state emission wavelength shift of 340&#8197;nm and two&#8208;step MCL that can respond to mechanical stimuli of different intensity were realized for two&#8208;component mixtures composed of this diamine and a variety of non&#8208;MCL acceptor dyes.







Abstract
Despite recent extensive studies on mechanochromic luminescence (MCL), rational control over the magnitude of the emission&#8208;wavelength shift in response to mechanical stimuli remains challenging. In the present study, a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach has been applied to create a variety of organic MCL composites that exhibit remarkable emission&#8208;wavelength switching. Dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine and typical organic fluorophores have been employed as donor and acceptor dyes, respectively. Outstanding wide&#8208;range MCL with an emission&#8208;wavelength shift of over 300&#8197;nm has been achieved by mixing the diamine with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Unprecedented two&#8208;step MCL in response to mechanical stimuli of different intensity has also been realized for a two&#8208;component mixture with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. Fluorescence microscopy observations at the single&#8208;particle level revealed that the segregation and mixing of the two&#8208;component dyes contribute to the stimuli&#8208;responsive emission&#8208;color switching of the MCL composites.

         <title>Towards an Understanding of the Molecular Mechanisms of Variable Unnatural Base&#8208;Pair Behavior: A Biophysical Analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>

An interdisciplinary study: The (d)NaM:(d)TPT3 unnatural base pair (UBP) can be replicated, transcribed, and translated in an organism, but its sequence context and orientation affects the fidelity and efficiency of these processes. We determined how this UBP affects nucleic acid duplexes, which provides mechanisms for variable behavior and can inform future UBP development.







Abstract
The series of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) developed by the Romesberg lab, which pair via hydrophobic and packing interactions have been replicated, transcribed, and translated inside of a living organism. However, as to why these UBPs exhibit variable fidelity and efficiency when used in different contexts is not clear. In an effort to gain some insights, we investigated the thermal stability and pairing selectivity of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP in 11nt duplexes via UV spectroscopy and the effects on helical structure via CD spectroscopy. We observed that while the duplexes containing a UBP are less stable than fully natural duplexes, they are generally more stable than duplexes containing natural mispairs. This work provides the first insights connecting the thermal stability of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP to the molecular mechanisms for varying replication fidelity in different sequence contexts in DNA, asymmetrical transcription fidelity, and codon:anticodon interactions and can assist in future UBP development.

Abstract
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208; and trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;triarylborane bithiophene chromophores are presented along with the water solubility and singlet oxygen sensitizing efficiency of the cationic compounds Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+. Comparison with the mono&#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the bis&#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+ with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.

         <title>Rethinking Uncaging: A New Antiaromatic Photocage Driven by a Gain of Resonance Energy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14121-14127, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of excited state aromaticity was used to design a new class of photolabile protecting groups, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Supported by theoretical calculations, several thio&#8208; and nitrogen functionalized compounds were synthesized, characterized and further optimized, resulting in a well accessible, visible light absorbing, new photocage with a high uncaging cross section of 893&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 405&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photoactivatable compounds for example photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited&#8208;state&#8208;aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The concept of&lt;/b&gt; excited state aromaticity was used to design a new class of photolabile protecting groups, based on cyclic, ground-state-antiaromatic systems. Supported by theoretical calculations, several thio- and nitrogen functionalized compounds were synthesized, characterized and further optimized, resulting in a well accessible, visible light absorbing, new photocage with a high uncaging cross section of 893&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 405&#8197;nm.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoactivatable compounds for example photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited-state-aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground-state-antiaromatic systems. Several thio- and nitrogen-functionalized compounds were synthesized, photochemically characterized and further optimized, supported by quantum chemical calculations. After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28&#8201;%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;) of 893&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 405&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Structural Diversity of Molecular Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Polyphosphides: From Supramolecular Wheel to Zintl Ion</title>

Mis&#8208;matched: Air stable pentaphosphaferrocene or white phosphorus are used as polyphosphorus source to access molecular group 2 polyphosphides. Structurally diverse polyphosphides ranging supramolecular wheel to Zintl ions have been accessed by using various group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium or molecular calcium hydride complex. The ancillary ligands and the metal ions influences the structural motifs of the polyphosphides, which was investigated theoretically as well.







Abstract
A series of molecular group 2 polyphosphides has been synthesized by using air&#8208;stable [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) or white phosphorus as polyphosphorus precursors. Different types of group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium, and molecular calcium hydride complexes have been investigated to activate these polyphosphorus sources. The organo&#8208;magnesium complex [(DippBDI&#8722;Mg(CH3))2] (DippBDI={[2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3NCMe]2CH}&#8722;) reacts with [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] to give an unprecedented Mg/Fe&#8208;supramolecular wheel. Kinetically controlled activation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] by different mono&#8208;valent magnesium complexes allowed the isolation of Mg&#8208;coordinated formally mono&#8208; and di&#8208;reduced products of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. To obtain the first examples of molecular calcium&#8208;polyphosphides, a molecular calcium hydride complex was used to reduce the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ring of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. The Ca&#8208;Fe&#8208;polyphosphide is also characterized by quantum chemical calculations and compared with the corresponding Mg complex. Moreover, a calcium coordinated Zintl ion (P7)3&#8722; was obtained by molecular calcium hydride mediated P4 reduction.

In this study, the complete mechanistic elucidation of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation is presented. Particular attention is paid to the deactivation pathway of the catalytic reaction. The associated deactivated species has been studied in detail by NMR and Raman spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, the present work includes a kinetic study carried out by in&#8197;situ operando NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Detailed mechanistic investigations on our previously reported synthesis of branched allylic esters by the rhodium complex&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation have been carried out. Based on initial mechanistic studies, we present herein more detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism. For this, various analytical (NMR, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, Raman) and kinetic methods were used to characterize the formation of intermediates under the reaction conditions. The knowledge obtained by this was used to further optimize the previous conditions and generate a more active catalytic system.

         <title>Influence of N&#8208;Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay&#8208;Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14081-14091, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a general synthetic strategy, we synthesized a new series of bay&#8208;linked dimeric perylene diimides (diPDIs), some of which possess primary N&#8208;alkyl substituents or unsymmetric N&#8208;substitution pattern. The systematic investigation on their photovoltaic properties revealed that the primary alkyl substituents are advantageous for enhancing the device performance in terms of crystallinity improvement and film&#8208;forming controllability.







Abstract
The influence of N&#8208;substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay&#8208;linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic&#8208;aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various N&#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl group, induce the self&#8208;organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.

         <title>Atypical and Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;P,N Ligands: Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of Cycloiminophosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14007-14016, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes, chirality and catalysts: 1,3&#8208;P,N hybrid ligands are broadly applied in cooperative catalysis, but show limited electronic variation. We report novel analogues with a high N&#8208;basicity, based on 7&#8208;membered cyclic imines. Their transition metal complexes demonstrated their donor strength (W), hemilabile coordination (Rh), and catalytic activity for nitrile hydration (Ru) and transfer hydrogenation (Ru, Ir). Chiral derivatives were also obtained, synthesized from l&#8208;menthone.







Abstract
Novel seven&#8208;membered cyclic imine&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;P,N ligands were obtained by capturing a Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate generated in situ from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These &#8220;cycloiminophosphanes&#8221; possess flexible non&#8208;isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity; this sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated by using their P&#8208;&#954;1&#8208; and P,N&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the trans&#8208;CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl2]2 demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, giving a dynamic equilibrium of &#954;1 and &#954;2 species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the &#954;2 complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the RuII&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free hydration of benzonitrile and the RuII&#8208; and IrI&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complexes, chirality and catalysts&lt;/b&gt;: 1,3-P,N hybrid ligands are broadly applied in cooperative catalysis, but show limited electronic variation. We report novel analogues with a high N-basicity, based on 7-membered cyclic imines. Their transition metal complexes demonstrated their donor strength (W), hemilabile coordination (Rh), and catalytic activity for nitrile hydration (Ru) and transfer hydrogenation (Ru, Ir). Chiral derivatives were also obtained, synthesized from &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-menthone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel seven-membered cyclic imine-based 1,3-P,N ligands were obtained by capturing a Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate generated in situ from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These &#8220;cycloiminophosphanes&#8221; possess flexible non-isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity; this sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated by using their P-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;- and P,N-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, giving a dynamic equilibrium of &#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the &#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed, solvent-free hydration of benzonitrile and the Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;- and Ir&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-menthone, as well as their P,N-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and a P-&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of the Retaining Glycosyltransferase Mannosylglycerate Synthase</title>

The mannosylglycerate synthase from the extremophile Rhodothermus marinus is a retaining glycosyltransferase able to synthesize a variety of small negatively charged molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules confer protection against extreme conditions such as extremely high or low temperatures, pH, and high salinity. Therefore, it has exciting potential biotechnological applications.







Abstract
To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress but also against other extreme conditions. They can also confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms making them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson's disease. In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria Rhodothermus marinus.

         <dc:description>
The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most important transformations in organic synthesis, but its efficiency depends on its selectivity that can be controlled by the innate reactivity of the substrate or a directing group. We review and discuss in a comprehensive manner C&#8722;H functionalization processes based on the transient directing group strategy.

A biophysical analysis of nucleic acid duplexes containing the unnatural hydrophobic base pair (d)NaM&#8208;dTPT3 provides an understanding of the type of molecular level interactions that could contribute to variabilities in replication, transcription and translation in a semisynthetic organism. Such approaches could provide a basis for comprehending the behavior of other unnatural base pairs (spheres top left) with a view towards unrestricted expansion of the genetic alphabet and code (spheres bottom&#8208;right) in a semisynthetic organism.

The creation of two&#8208;component dyes has proven to be an effective strategy to achieve remarkable mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) properties. The shift of the maximum emission wavelength (&#916;&#955;em) range of a bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine derivative has been significantly improved by mixing it with typical organic dyes that do not exhibit MCL behavior. Most notably, a wide&#8208;range MCL (&#916;&#955;em=340&#8197;nm) has been achieved for a mixture with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step MCL has been realized by mixing with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Ito, T.&#8197;Tachikawa, et&#8197;al.

The link is shown between a pioneering chemist's questioning &#8211; drawing and sharing thoughts on a blackboard &#8211; and a solution by means of modern catalytic tools &#8211; illustrated by computer lettering. Our question was how to regioselectively introduce a halogen atom into valuable phenylalanine derivatives without using a heavy protecting group in order to rapidly construct nonproteinogenic amino acids. The proposed solution was a Pd&#8208;catalyzed and sustainable regioselective C&#8722;H halogenation process directed by a native amine functional group.

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8722;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>

Strategic functionalization: The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most important transformations in organic synthesis, but its efficiency depends on its selectivity, which can be controlled by the innate reactivity of the substrate or a directing group. While this last strategy has turned out to be efficient, the directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation. These two undesired synthetic operations can be avoided by using the transient directing group strategy that is comprehensively overviewed in this review article.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8722;H bond, this selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8722;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8722;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are sometimes still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the in&#8197;situ installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8722;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.

The latest applications of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with multifunctional nanomaterials in tumor treatment are summarized. Nanomaterials with different characteristics can optimize the Fenton reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction to make CDT produce distinctive enhancement effects. The combination of nanomaterials, CDT and various other therapies would promote the multi&#8208;functionalization of the treatment system, thereby enhancing the anticancer effect.







Abstract
During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to summarize the recent advances comprehensively and systematically in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.

N,N&#8208;Dimethylamides for continuous flow acylations: A new acylation of (hetero)aryllithiums with polyfunctional and enolizable N,N&#8208;dimethylamides in toluene in continuous flow was reported. The required lithium species was prepared at 25&#8201;&#176;C from (hetero)aryl bromides and sec&#8208;BuLi in toluene. Additionally, a new telescoped procedure, using tetramethylurea as C1&#8208;building block, was described providing highly functionalized unsymmetrical ketones.







Abstract
The continuous flow reaction of various aryl or heteroaryl bromides in toluene in the presence of THF (1.0&#8197;equiv) with sec&#8208;BuLi (1.1&#8197;equiv) provided at 25&#8201;&#176;C within 40&#8197;sec the corresponding aryllithiums which were acylated with various functionalized N,N&#8208;dimethylamides including easily enolizable amides at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C within 27&#8197;sec, producing highly functionalized ketones in 48&#8211;90&#8201;% yield (36 examples). This method was well suited for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones such as naproxene and ibuprofen derived ketones with 99&#8201;% ee. A one&#8208;pot stepwise bis&#8208;addition of two different lithium organometallics to 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyurea (TMU) provided unsymmetrical ketones in 69&#8211;79&#8201;% yield (9 examples).

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Halogenation of Phenylalanine Derivatives</title>

A site&#8208;selective, primary amine (as a native NH2 functionality)&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine platforms is demonstrated. Efficient and versatile, this strategy paves the way to constructing a large array of original halogenated phenylalanine derivatives as nonproteinogenic AAs.







Abstract
An efficient primary&#8208;amine&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine derivatives is reported on a range of quaternary amino acid (AA) derivatives thanks to suitable conditions employing trifluoroacetic acid as additive. The extension of this original native functionality&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;selective halogenation was even demonstrated with the more challenging native phenylalanine as tertiary AA.

         <title>Photocatalyzed E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Boronates with Binaphthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 13966-13970, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going against the grain: Photocatalytic, contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is described. The reaction permits the geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The reaction manifold was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is disclosed. The reaction, based on the transient formation of a suitable chromophore with a BINOL derivative as the catalyst, allowed geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The mechanism of this E&#8594;Z contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization was studied, and the formation of a transient chromophore species is suggested.

         <title>Intramolecular C&#8722;H Amination of N&#8208;Alkylsulfamides by tert&#8208;Butyl Hypoiodite or N&#8208;Iodosuccinimide</title>

A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) for the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamides is reported. The six&#8208;membered cyclic sulfamide products can be easily converted into a variety of useful 1,3&#8208;diamines. The present amination that effectively proceeds under ambient conditions, features operationally simple, practical, and scalable methodology.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diamines are an important class of compounds that are broadly found in natural products and are also widely used as building blocks in organic synthesis. Although the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamide derivatives is a reliable method for the construction of 1,3&#8208;diamine structures, the majority of these methods involve the use of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst. We herein report on a new transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS), enabling secondary non&#8208;benzylic and tertiary C&#8722;H amination reactions to proceed. The cyclic sulfamide products can be easily transformed into 1,3&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that amination reactions using t&#8208;BuOI or NIS each proceed via different pathways.

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varying and Rare Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metabolome&#8208;guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium  Corallococcus  sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A featuring a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host  Myxococcus xanthus  DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacycline A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacycline E and F intriguingly were found to contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. In addition to the full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycles in these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Symmetry Relaxes Structural and Magnetic Restraints, Suppressing QTM in Enantiopure Butterfly Fe2Dy2 SMMs.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The {Fe  2  Dy  2  } butterfly systems can show Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour, the nature of which depends on details of the electronic structure, as previously demonstrated for the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  compound, where the [N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;amino]&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (Me&#8208;teaH  3  ) ligand is usually used in its racemic form. Here we describe the consequences for the SMM properties by using enantiopure versions of this ligand and present here the first homochiral 3d/4f SMM, which could only be obtained for the S enantiomer of the ligand for  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  since the R&#8208;enantiomer underwent significant racemisation. To investigate this further, we prepared the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  4  (NO  3  )  2  ]  version, which could be obtained as the  RS  &#8208;,  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;compounds. Remarkably, the enantiopure versions show enhanced slow relaxation of magnetisation. The use of the enantiomerically pure ligand suppresses QTM, leading to the conclusion that use of enantiopure ligands is a &#8220;gamechanger&#8221; by breaking the cluster symmetry and altering the intimate details of the coordination cluster&#8217;s molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting the Mechanism of H2 Activation by Monomeric and Potassium&#8208;Stabilized Dimeric Al(I) Complexes: Do Potassium Atoms Exert any Cooperative Effect?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminyl anions are low valent, anionic and carbenoid aluminum species. Various research groups have detected that the potassium atoms play a stabilization role via electrostatic and cation  &#8230;  &#960; interactions with nearby (aromatic)&#8208;carbocyclic rings. In this work, the activation of H  2  utilizing a NON&#8208;xanthene&#8208;Al dimer (  D  ) and monomeric (  M  ) catalysts are studied to reveal the potential role of K  +&#160;  atoms during the activation of this gas.&#160; We aim to reveal whether if  D  is more reactive than  M  (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the  D  catalyst . The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric catalysts were found to be very close (around 33 kcal mol  &#8208;1  ). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the natures of the energy barriers are inherently different, the former being dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants. Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H  2  distorts the most, usually over 0.77&#916;E  dist  . Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies are the main stabilizing components of the interaction energy. The results suggest that the K  +  atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their catalytic role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H  2  . Cooperation between the two monomers in  D  is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H  2  is wholly disengaged.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing H2 Evolution Activity Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2 formed an S&#8208;type heterojunction. The mixed interface structure between them provided a new hydrogen&#8208;producing active center for each. In addition, the S&#8208;type heterojunction electron transfer mechanism not only promoted the separation of electrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+) between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2, but also retained electrons with strong reducibility, thereby promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S) of CoS2 nanospheres modified Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution was synthesized and studied. The H2 evolution rate of the composite catalyst reached 25.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which was 3.26&#8197;times that of single Zn0.5Cd0.5S, whereas pure CoS2 showed almost no hydrogen production activity. Moreover, CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S had excellent stability and the hydrogen production rate after six cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19&#8201;%. In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was better than CoS2 or Zn0.5Cd0.5S single catalyst. In this study, the synthesized CoS2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S were both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H+ protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8722;/C&#8722;Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular thiophene&#8208;arene C&#8722;C heterocoupling is successfully achieved in a set of topologically and electronically engineered bis(biaryl)thiophenes (BATs) under Scholl oxidative conditions to provide symmetric and unsymmetric diphenanthrothiophenes (DPTs), simple thiananographenes. The thia&#8208;edge of diphenanthrothiophenes are conveniently transformed into blue&#8208;emissive and electrochemically stable N&#8722;/C&#8722;edged congeners.







Abstract
While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8722;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene's reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8722;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes which are basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple's electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8722;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8722;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Between Cyclodextrins and Hybrid Hexavanadates: What are the Driving Forces?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic or chaotropic effect? Hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates self&#8208;assemble with cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;) in water to form a wide variety of host&#8208;guest complexes. Such a supramolecular process originates from the ability of the CD host to desolvate the hybrid guests, but the nature of this solvent effect depends on the cyclodextrins, inducing direct consequences on redox properties of the guest.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest complexes between native cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) and hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates (POVs) [V6O13((OCH2)3C&#8722;R)2]2&#8211; with R = CH2CH3, NO2, CH2OH and NH(BOC) (BOC = N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl) were studied in aqueous solution. Six crystal structures determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the nature of the functional R group strongly influences the host&#8211;guest conformation and also the crystal packing. In all systems isolated in the solid&#8208;state, the organic groups R are embedded within the cyclodextrin cavities, involving only a few weak supramolecular contacts. The interaction between hybrid POVs and the macrocyclic organic hosts have been deeply studied in solution using ITC, cyclic voltammetry and NMR methods (1D 1H NMR, and 2D DOSY, and ROESY). This set of complementary techniques provides clear insights about the strength of interactions and the binding host&#8208;guest modes occurring in aqueous solution, highlighting a dramatic influence of the functional group R on the supramolecular properties of the hexavanadate polyoxoanions (association constant K1:1 vary from 0 to 2 000&#8197;M&#8722;1) while isolated functional organic groups exhibit only very weak intrinsic affinity with CDs. Electrochemical and calorimetric investigations suggest that the driving force of the host&#8208;guest association involving larger CDs (&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) is mainly related to the chaotropic effect. In contrast, the hydrophobic effect supported by weak attractive forces appears as the main contributor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;containing host&#8208;guest complexes. In any cases, the origin of driving forces is clearly related to the ability of the macrocyclic host to desolvate the exposed moieties of the hybrid POVs.

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical oligophenylene: Chiral cyclic homologues with unique structures such as double helices and twisted triangles, have been synthesized as highly emissive chiroptical dyes. The twisted quaterphenyl units exhibited CPL with a high quantum yield (0.73&#8211;0.80), leading to relatively high CPL brightness.







Abstract
A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (2) and trimer (3) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in 2 adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore, 3 forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that 2 has a larger strain energy than 3 owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH2Cl2 solution. The spectra of both 2 and 3 are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety. These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (&#981;=0.70&#8211;0.83) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|gCPL|=1.6&#215;10&#8722;3) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (&lt;i&gt;&#981;&lt;/i&gt;=0.70&#8211;0.83) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Blue OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 7.5&#8201;% Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Better Constructions: By inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building block, two D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent blue emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI were designed and synthesized. Impressively, the doped deep&#8208;blue OLED based on IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI exhibited excellent performances with an unexpectedly high EQE of 7.5&#8201;% with the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which is one of the best among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12.







Abstract
Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, the authors successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI, featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high photo luminescent quantum yields and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 4.32&#8201;% and 5.41&#8201;%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI was achieved with an excellent CEmax of 5.83 cd A&#8722;1, EQEmax of 4.6&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly, IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI&#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQEmax of 7.51&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T7 to S2. Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.

         <title>Janus All&#8208;Cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;Pentafluorocyclohexyl Building Blocks Applied to Medicinal Chemistry and Bioactives Discovery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl building blocks have been incorporated into medicinal chemistry type products. These cyclohexanes have polarized faces and represent a unique motif for medicinal chemistry. The paper introduces a range of new accessible building blocks which can be elaborated into a diversity of drug type structures demonstrating their wider utility for exploration in bioactives discovery chemistry.







Abstract
Monoalkylated derivatives of the unusually polar all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorocyclohexyl (Janus face) motif are prepared starting from an aryl hydrogenation of 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorophenylacetate methyl ester 15. The method used Zeng's Rh(CAAC) carbene catalyst 4 in the hydrogenation following the protocol developed by Glorius. The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester 16 was converted to the corresponding alcohol 18, aldehyde 13, bromide 29 and azide 14 through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi&#8208;multicomponent and Cu&#8208;catalysed click reactions. NBoc protected pentafluoroarylphenylalanine methyl ester 35 was also subject to an aryl hydrogenation, and then deprotection to generate the Janus face &#946;&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl&#8208;alanine amino acid 15, which was incorporated into representative members of an emerging class of candidate antiviral compounds. Log&#8197;P measurements demonstrate that the all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl ring system is more polar than a phenyl ring. In overview the paper introduces new building blocks containing this Janus ring and demonstrates their progression to molecules typically used in bioactives discovery programmes.

         <title>Stereoselective Direct N&#8208;Trifluoropropenylation of Heterocycles with a Hypervalent Iodonium Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
E&#8208;selective trifluoropropenylation of versatile N&#8208;heterocycles was developed with the utilization of trifluoropropenyliodonium salts. The procedure enables the straightforward direct introduction of the trifluoroalkenyl moiety into heterocyclic scaffolds under simple and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The availability and synthesis of fluorinated enamine derivatives such as N&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropenyl)heterocycles are challenging, especially through direct functionalization of the heterocyclic scaffold. Herein, a stereoselective N&#8208;trifluoropropenylation method based on the use of a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropenyl iodonium salt is described. This reagent enables the straightforward trifluoropropenylation of various N&#8208;heterocycles under mild reaction conditions, providing trifluoromethyl enamine type moieties with high stereoselectivity and efficiency.

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity exploration by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT of a cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complex, as the first member of a new series of Au(III) complexes, has confirmed the low hydricity in dark and the high propensity to undergo substitution reactions leading to H2 release when irradiated. Computational photophysical characterization has allowed the identification of the excited singlet and triplet states involved in substitution reactions. Two&#8208;photon excitation feasibility has been also tested.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named 1&#8201;a, is reported. Complex 1&#8201;a low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H2 elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two&#8208;photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.

         <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere&#8211;Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon sphere&#8211;implanted graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet photocatalysts were prepared by a bottom&#8208;up method. The photocatalysts promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through special interface coupling and hollow carbon spheres as an electron acceptor, leading to remarkably improved photocatalytic efficiency. This work thus provides an efficient pathway for the design of efficient and low&#8208;cost cocatalysts for photocatalysis.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly was employed to manipulate inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular interaction of PBI&#8208;based complexes (trigonal prism and dicycle). Two complexes exhibit distinct different properties on excited state process and aggregation behaviour due to their geometrical arrangements. Trigonal prism to dicycle transformation could be tracked by fluorescence change. (Note: ISC and SB&#8208;CS in graphic are intersystem crossing and symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation, respectively.)







Abstract
Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (2) and a trigonal prism (3) were generated via using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent, cis&#8208;(PEt3)2Pt(OTf)2&#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an ortho&#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (1), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (&#8764;13&#8201;%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC). 2, however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of &#8764;41&#8201;%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of 3 is merely &#8764;6&#8201;% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly, 3 could be fully transformed into 2 by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover, 2 tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but 3 does not show the property. Therefore, controlling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared via organic synthesis.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Propensity in Solution: Direct Observation and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly activated halogen bond donors give rise to observable bound and unbound states in Raman spectroscopy when paired with good halogen bond acceptors. The two strongest halogen bond donors examined have almost identical electrostatic potentials, but differ vastly in theoretical binding affinity and experimental halogen bonding strength. The energy terms giving rise to this behavior are elucidated by energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.

         <dc:description>
The essence of van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;UV (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are illustrated as an important material system recently developed. Using first&#8208;principles simulations, the key role of the interlayer vdW connection for DUV NLO balance is discussed and the discovery process of related vdW DUV NLO materials is reviewed, with emphasis on the prospect of opportunities and challenges.







Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;UV (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal is an important material system recently developed. Herein, we review its concept and original intention, and then summarized the discovery process of related materials, including the role of A&#8208;site cations and the resulting two&#8208;/one&#8208;dimensional vdW DUV NLO systems. Finally, we evaluate the practical DUV NLO performance and prospected the opportunities and challenges.

         <title>Facile Conversion of Molecularly Complex (Hetero)aryl Carboxylic Acids into Alkynes for Accelerated SAR Exploration</title>

         <dc:description>
Bringing molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into the bioisostere world: A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation is reported that allows the synthesis of aryl alkynes from highly functionalized aryl and heteroaryl carboxylic acids. The reaction shows an unmatched substrate scope mainly thanks to its remarkably mild reaction conditions using a homogenous Pd/Cu bimetallic system. The utility of this protocol was showcased by the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8722;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization by copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8722;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation that allows the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labeled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of defect generation by thermal reduction on the structure and electrocatalytic performance of LaNiO3 has been examined in a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Surface defects, predominantly surface oxygen vacancies, promote oxygen evolution over LaNiO3 resulting in a significantly lower overpotential (380&#8197;mV) for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faster kinetics (70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope) and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes to conventionally prepared LaNiO3. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Arandiyan, Y. Wang, T. Maschmeyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102672).

         <title>Formation and Structure of Hydrolytic Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling of kinetics using density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation, reveals that methylaluminoxane activators are sheets formed by assembly of linear oligomers, wherein the statistics and mechanism of aggregation favor formation of even&#8208;numbered sheets.







Abstract
Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me3Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterisation of Luminescent [CrIII2L(&#956;&#8208;carboxylato)]3+ Complexes with High&#8208;Spin S=3 Ground States (L=N6S2 donor ligand)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand chromium(III) complexes, [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+, where L represents a macrocyclic binucleating hexaamine&#8208;dithiophenolato ligand and R=Me or Ph, has been achieved. The complexes exhibit a relatively strong intramolecular ferromagnetic exchange interaction that leads to an S=3 spin ground state (J &#8764;24&#8211;34&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The complexes emit at 750&#8197;nm (&#934;L=45&#8201;%) by excitation into the intense LMCT and d&#8208;d* bands.







Abstract
The synthesis, structure, magnetic, and photophysical properties of two dinuclear, luminescent, mixed&#8208;ligand [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+ complexes (R=CH3 (1), Ph (2)) of a 24&#8208;membered binucleating hexa&#8208;aza&#8208;dithiophenolate macrocycle (L)2&#8722; are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals an edge&#8208;sharing bioctahedral N3Cr(&#956;&#8208;SR)2(&#956;1,3&#8208;O2CR)CrN3 core structure with &#956;1,3&#8208;bridging carboxylate groups. A ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the electron spins of the Cr3+ ions leads to a high&#8208;spin (S=3) ground state. The coupling constants (J=+24.2(1)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (1), +34.8(4)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (2), H=&#8722;2JS1S2) are significantly larger than in related bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;alkoxido&#8208;&#956;&#8208;carboxylato structures. DFT calculations performed on both complexes reproduce both the sign and strength of the exchange interactions found experimentally. Frozen methanol&#8208;dichloromethane 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 solutions of 1 and 2 luminesce at 750&#8197;nm when excited into the 4LMCT state on the 4A2 &#8594; 2T1 (&#957;2) bands (&#955;exc=405&#8197;nm). The absolute quantum yields (&#934;L) for 1 and 2 were found to be strongly temperature dependent. At 77&#8197;K in frozen MeOH/CH2Cl2 glasses, &#934;L=0.44&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 1), &#934;L=0.45&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 2).

         <title>Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homoleptic, 3D&#8208;coordination polymers of the formula  3  &#8734;  [Ln(3&#8208;PyPz)  3  ] and  3  &#8734;  [Ln(4&#8208;PyPz)  3  ], (3&#8208;PyPz)&#175;= 3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, (4&#8208;PyPz)&#175;= 3&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, both C  8  H  6  N  3  &#8208;  , Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, were obtained as highly luminescent frameworks by reactions of the lanthanide metals (Ln) with the aromatic heterocyclic amine ligands; 3&#8208;PyPzH and 4&#8208;PyPzH. The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D&#8208;coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid&#8208;state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields up to 74%. The emission is mainly based on ion specific lanthanide&#8208;dependent intra 4f&#8211;4f&#8208;transitions for Tb  3+  : green, Dy  3+  : yellow, Sm  3+  : orange&#8208;red, Eu  3+  : red. For the Gd  3+  containing compounds, yellow emission of ligand triplet&#8208;based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77 K. Co&#8208;doping of the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks with Eu  3+  and Tb  3+  allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal tetrylene complexes offer great opportunities for molecular cooperation due to the ambiphilic character of the group 14 element. Here we focus on the coordination of germylene [(Ar Mes2 ) 2 Ge:] (Ar Mes = C 6 H 3 &#8208;2,6&#8208;(C 6 H 2 &#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me 3 ) 2 ) to [RhCl(COD)] 2 (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), which yields a neutral germyl complex in which the rhodium center exhibits both &#951; 6 &#8208; and &#951; 2 &#8208;coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer&#8208;type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8212;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium&#8208;germyl species associated to three C&#8212;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Dependent Dissolution of Non&#8208;Cubic Au Crystallites in Aqua Regia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqua regia readily dissolves the fcc tips of the Au bipyramidal crystallites and the core consisting of tetragonal and orthorhombic lattices, undergoes transformation to produce increased proportions of tetragonal lattices, before eventually giving up in dissolution. The study not only showcases the reactivity patterns associated with different Au lattices but also provides an insight into the lattice distribution within the crystallite.







Abstract
Properties of metal crystallites are governed by their morphologies and inherent crystal structures. In this work, bipyramidal Au microcrystallites hosting non&#8208;cubic lattices, body&#8208;centered orthorhombic and tetragonal (together termed as bc(o,t)), are investigated for their stability in aqua regia. Specifically, microcrystallites comprising 92&#8201;% of bc(o,t) have been subjected to aqua regia of different concentrations and the changes in morphology and lattice phases have been monitored using scanning electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The dissolution process was found to be crystal structure dependent and begin at the bipyramidal tips enriched with fcc lattice while retaining the bc(o,t) rich body. Interestingly, with increasing the reaction times, the remaining core was found to be highly reluctant to dissolution and instead, transformed to tetragonal lattices which with increasing treatment, exhibited lattice parameters closer to that of fcc. The study reveals the presence of a bc(o,t)&#8208;fcc core&#8208;shell structure with the tips enriched with fcc.

         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced C&#8722;H benzylation under ruthernium catalysis enabled exceedingly mild syntheses of diarylmethane compounds. The robustness of this approach was demonstrated by an ample scope, including photo C&#8722;H allylations and reactions on water.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of diarylmethane compounds was realized under exceedingly mild photoredox conditions without the use of exogenous photocatalysts. The versatility and robustness of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H benzylation was reflected by an ample scope, including multifold C&#8722;H functionalizations, as well as transformable pyrazoles, imidates and sensitive nucleosides. Mechanistic studies were indicative of a photoactive cyclometalated ruthenium complex, which also enabled versatile C&#8722;H allylations.

         <title>Trinuclear Cyanido&#8208;Bridged [Cr2Fe] Complexes: To Be or not to Be a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet, a Matter of Straightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanido&#8208;bridged trinuclear [CrIII2FeII] complexes were investigated in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical Fe&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on their SMM behaviors. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.







Abstract
Trinuclear systems of formula [{Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2}2M(H2LN3O2R)] (M=MnII and FeII, LN3O2R stands for pentadentate ligands) were prepared in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical M&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII derivatives and in turn on their Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviors. The cyanido&#8208;bridged [Cr2M] derivatives were obtained by assembling trans&#8208;dicyanido CrIII complex [Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2]&#8722; and divalent pentagonal bipyramid complexes [MII(H2LN3O2R)]2+ with various R substituents (R=NH2, cyclohexyl, S,S&#8208;mandelic) imparting different steric demand to the central moiety of the complexes. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the [Cr2Fe] complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects of the bending of the apical C&#8722;N&#8722;Fe linkages on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.

         <title>A Cyclometalated NHC Iridium Complex Bearing a Cationic (&#951;5&#8208;Cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron Backbone**

Iron power: A cyclometalated Fe(II) and Ir(III) complex based on the cationic (&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]imidazole skeleton is reported. Compared to its neutral analogue without the [CpFe]+ fragment, it is surprisingly active in the transfer hydrogenation of ketones. Mechanistic investigation on the reaction paths performed by DFT calculations provided a better understanding of the reaction mechanism, possible intermediates and the active species.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitution of [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;chlorobenzene)iron(II)] hexafluorophosphate with sodium imidazolate resulted in the formation of [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]imidazole hexafluorophosphate. The corresponding dicationic imidazolium salt, which was obtained by treating this imidazole precursor with methyl iodide, underwent cyclometallation with bis[dichlorido(&#951;5&#8208;1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl]iridium(III) in the presence of triethyl amine. The resulting bimetallic iridium(III) complex is the first example of an NHC complex bearing a cationic and cyclometallated [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]+ substituent. As its iron(II) precursors, the bimetallic iridium(III) complex was fully characterized by means of spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, it was investigated in a catalytic study, wherein it showed high activity in transfer hydrogenation compared to its neutral analogue having a simple phenyl instead of a cationic [(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]+ unit at the NHC ligand.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformations of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxyketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium and enzyme catalysis were combined in a one&#8208;pot procedure to achieve efficient DYKAT of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones. This newly developed protocol offers straightforward access to enantiomerically pure and diastereomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;oxoacetates in high yields by employing a ruthenium&#8208;based racemization catalyst for efficient racemization&#8208;epimerization of substrates via formation of non&#8208;chiral 1,3&#8208;diketone intermediates.







Abstract
Herein we report on the development and application of chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DYKAT) of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones (&#946;&#8208;HKs), using Candida antartica lipase B (CALB) as transesterification catalyst and a ruthenium complex as epimerization catalyst. An operationally simple protocol allows for an efficient preparation of highly enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;oxoacetates. The products were obtained in yields up to 95&#8201;% with good diastereomeric ratios.

         <title>Plasmon Coupling Enhanced Micro&#8208;spectroscopy and Imaging for Sensitive Discrimination of Membrane Domains of a Single Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different cell&#160;membrane domains play different roles&#160;in many&#160;cell processes, and the discrimination of these domains is of considerable&#160;importance for the elucidation of cellular functions.&#160;However, the strategies&#160;available for distinguishing these cell membrane&#160;domains&#160;are limited.&#160;We propose a novel technique called plasmon coupling enhanced micro&#8208;spectroscopy and imaging&#160;to discriminate basal and lateral membrane domains of a single cell.&#160;This technology combines&#160;the application of an&#160;additional plasmonic silver film for&#160;surface plasmon&#160;(SP) excitation to selectively excite and enhance&#160;the basal membranes in the near&#8208;field with directional enhanced microscopic imaging and spectroscopy. The SP and critical evanescent fields are induced upon excitation&#160;through a&#160;silver&#8208;coated semitransparent coverslip at the SPR and critical&#160;angles, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Different cell&#160;membrane domains play different roles&#160;in many&#160;cell processes, and the discrimination of these domains is of considerable&#160;importance for the elucidation of cellular functions.&#160;However, the strategies&#160;available for distinguishing these cell membrane&#160;domains&#160;are limited.&#160;We propose a novel technique called plasmon coupling enhanced micro-spectroscopy and imaging&#160;to discriminate basal and lateral membrane domains of a single cell.&#160;This technology combines&#160;the application of an&#160;additional plasmonic silver film for&#160;surface plasmon&#160;(SP) excitation to selectively excite and enhance&#160;the basal membranes in the near-field with directional enhanced microscopic imaging and spectroscopy. The SP and critical evanescent fields are induced upon excitation&#160;through a&#160;silver-coated semitransparent coverslip at the SPR and critical&#160;angles, respectively. The basal and lateral membrane domains&#160;located within the SP and critical evanescent fields can be selectively excited and distinguished&#160;by adjusting the incident angle of laser&#160;irradiation. Moreover, the brighter images and more intense&#160;spectra of membrane-targeting fluorescence-Raman probes under directional excitation than in conventional EPI mode&#160;allow clear identification of the membrane domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Study of the Cycloaddition of CO2 with Styrene Oxide Over Six&#8208;Connected spn Topology MOFs (Zr, Hf) at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs with six Zr6 or Hf6 clusters were used for the catalytic CO2 and styrene oxide cycloaddition reactions. They all have the same spn topology skeletons, and ortho&#8208;octahedral morphology. MOF&#8208;818&#8208;Zr with higher acid site density exhibited good catalytic activity and stability at room temperature and an initial pressure of 1&#8197;bar CO2. DFT results showed that the metal was coordinated to the styrene oxide and the halogen attacked the &#946;&#8208;carbon of the styrene oxide (ND&#8208;ERO).







Abstract
A series of MOFs with a 6&#8208;connected spn topology were synthesized (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(Zr, Hf), PCN&#8208;777&#8208;(Zr, Hf), MOF&#8208;818&#8208;(Zr, Hf)). Through the in&#8197;situ DRIFTS of NH3 adsorption&#8208;desorption, we found that the activated catalyst mainly contains Lewis acid sites. The effects of different organic ligands on the Lewis acid of the Zr6 cluster were analyzed by XPS and NH3&#8208;TPD, and the relative Lewis acidity of the same metal was obtained: PCN&#8208;777&gt;MOF&#8208;808&gt;MOF&#8208;818. In the Py&#8208;FTIR results, we confirmed that MOF&#8208;818 has a higher acid site density. In the activity test, MOFs with mesoporous structure showed better catalytic activity under normal temperature and pressure. Among them, MOF&#8208;818 can still maintain a high degree of crystallinity after catalysis. Finally, we use density functional theory to propose the mechanism of the cycloaddition reaction of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. The results show that the metal is coordinated with styrene oxide and halogens attack the &#946; carbon of the epoxide.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Tri&#8208;/Difluoromethyl Ketones from Carboxylic Acids by Cross&#8208;Coupling with Acyloxyphosphonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advantageous synthetic route: Deoxytrifluoromethylation and difluoromethylation of carboxylic acids give access to di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl ketones. The key to the success of these transformations is the use of acyloxyphosphonium ions prepared in&#8197;situ as acyl electrophiles. The protocols use extremely mild reaction conditions and short reactions times and can tolerate a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
A simple and straightforward approach to the synthesis of trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl ketones from widely available carboxylic acids is disclosed. The transformation utilizes an acyloxyphosphonium ion as the active electrophile, conveniently generated in&#8197;situ from the carboxylic acid substrate by using commodity chemicals. The utility of the reaction system is exemplified by its chemoselectivity, with tolerance to a variety of important functional groups. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of carboxylic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients and pharmaceutically relevant compounds is also discussed.

         <title>An Isolable Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanone and Its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone: bis(imino)germanone [IPrN]2Ge=O (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. Initial reactivity studies combined with experimental and computational bonding analysis revealed highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Moreover, transition metal oxide&#8208;like reactivity has been observed for the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide.







Abstract
A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone [IPrN]2Ge=O (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. The germanone has a rather high thermal stability in arene solvent, and no detectable change was observed at 80&#8201;&#176;C for at least one week. However, high thermal stability of [IPrN]2Ge=O does not prevent its reactivity toward small molecules. Structural analysis and initial reactivity studies revealed the highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Besides, the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide make it a mimic of nucleophilic transition&#8208;metal oxides. Mechanism for O&#8208;atom transfer reaction was investigated via DFT calculations, which revealed that the reaction proceeds via a [2+2] cycloaddition intermediate.

         <title>[(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ Complexes as a New Family of Anticancer Candidates: Synthesis, Characterization and Exploration of the Antiproliferative Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reorganization of the coordination sphere of the [(C&#8201;N&#8201;C)AuL]+ scaffold led to the establishment of the [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ family with a preserved redox stability but an enhanced reactivity toward biomolecules making it a new class of organogold anticancer agent.







Abstract
A library of eleven cationic gold(III) complexes of the general formula [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ when C&#8201;C is either biphenyl or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;ditertbutyldiphenyl and N&#8201;N is a bipyridine, phenanthroline or dipyridylamine derivative have been synthesized and characterized. Contrasting effects on the viability of the triple negative breast cancer cells MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 was observed from a preliminary screening. The antiproliferative activity of the seven most active complexes were further assayed on a larger panel of human cancer cells as well as on non&#8208;cancerous cells for comparison. Two complexes stood out for being either highly active or highly selective. Eventually, reactivity studies with biologically meaningful amino acids, glutathione, higher order DNA structures and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) revealed a markedly different behavior from that of the well&#8208;known coordinatively isomeric [(C&#8201;N&#8201;C)Au(NHC)]+ structure. This makes the [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ complexes a new class of organogold compounds with an original mode of action.

         <title>A Full Flexible NH4+ Ion Battery Based on the Concentrated Hydrogel Electrolyte for Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full flexible ammonium ion battery composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between a NH4V3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and a polyaniline anode is reported. The simple synthesis of the hydrogel using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water, allows to facilely tune and optimize the salt concentration in the electrolyte, to maximize its ionic conductivity and transport kinetics. It is found that the battery based on the electrolyte prepared using 3&#8197;M ammonium sulfate solution exhibits the best performance.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal ammonium (
) ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of 
 redox chemistry in batteries, particularly in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full 
 ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode, for enhanced performance. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference, the AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121&#8197;mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. On the other hand, the simple synthesis of the hydrogel electrolyte allows us to facilely tune and optimize the salt contents in the electrolyte, to maximize the ionic conductivity, transport kinetics, mechanical characteristics, and consequently the battery performance. It is found that the flexible battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3&#8197;M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance, i.&#8201;e., a capacity of 60&#8197;mAh g&#8722;1 while maintaining a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for developments of novel electrochemical energy storage technology with high safety and low cost.

         <title>Diastereoselective Double C&#8722;H Functionalization of Chiral Ferrocenes with Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;Complexes with N&#8208;Boc protected amino acids catalyze diastereoselective oxidative double C&#8722;H functionalization of chiral ferrocenyl amines with heteroarenes. A range of thiophene, pyrrole, furan and indole ferrocene derivative can be obtained in a single step and in high diastereomeric purities. C&#8722;H activation products can be transformed to corresponding phosphines. 19F NMR and DFT calculations helped elucidate reaction mechanism and reasons for stereoinduction.







Abstract
Diastereoselective double C&#8722;H heteroarylation of chiral ferrocenes provides valuable compounds with multiple functionalities using mild reaction conditions and simple reagents. Pd&#8208;Complexes with chiral mono&#8208;protected amino acids afforded corresponding heteroarylated ferrocenyl amines in good yields and high diastereomeric purities. In this way, a variety of indole, thiophene, pyrrole, or furan substituents were introduced to the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, a range of relevant functional groups, for example ketone, ester, chloro, nitro, or silyl, are tolerated by this method. An alternative combination of amino acid and ferrocenyl amine configurations was leveraged to provide the complementary diastereomeric products. The products of C&#8722;H heteroarylation can be transformed into corresponding phosphines. Absolute configurations of CH&#8208;activation products were confirmed by the combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and CD spectroscopy. 19F NMR kinetic study and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons governing stereoinduction.

         <title>On the Origin of the Non&#8208;Planarity in Biarylsilyloxonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the pyramidalization of the oxygen center in biarylsilyl oxoniums salts was studied through NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a series of biphenylsilyl oxonium salts, and supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The structure determination of a series of biphenylsilyloxonium cations through NMR and XRD studies, supported by DFT calculations was carried out, allowing to get insights into the origin of the oxygen pyramidalization in biphenyl and binaphthylsilyl oxoniums. Low barrier of inversion in the oxygenyl series points toward a key role of the biaryl axis in the inversion of configuration at the oxygen center.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentadienylmagnesium bromides are accessible with high yields by a fast and smooth one&#8208;pot synthesis. In hydrocarbons and in ethereal solvents a dissociative Schlenk equilibrium is operative interconverting heteroleptic compounds into homoleptic congeners.







Abstract
In the in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C5H6 (HCp), C5H5&#8208;Si(iPr)3 (HCpTIPS)] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et2O)Mg(CpR)(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 (CpR=Cp (1), CpTIPS (2)). The Schlenk equilibrium of 2 in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(CpR)2] (3) and [(Et2O)MgBr(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 (4). Interfering solvation and aggregation as well as ligand redistribution equilibria hamper a quantitative elucidation of thermodynamic data for the Schlenk equilibrium of 2 in toluene. In ethereal solvents, mononuclear species [(Et2O)2Mg(CpTIPS)Br] (2&#8217;), [(Et2O)nMg(CpTIPS)2] (3&#8217;), and [(Et2O)2MgBr2] (4&#8217;) coexist. Larger coordination numbers can be realized with cyclic ethers like tetrahydropyran allowing crystallization of [(thp)4MgBr2] (5). The interpretation of the temperature&#8208;dependency of the Schlenk equilibrium constant in diethyl ether gives a reaction enthalpy &#916;H and reaction entropy &#916;S of &#8722;11.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 60&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively.

Hence, within advanced structure search and first&#8208;principle calculations, we identify several unprecedented Y&#8208;P compounds (e.g., Y  3  P, Y  2  P, Y  3  P  2  , Y  2  P  3  , YP  2  , and YP  3  ) under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain&#8208;like network, buckled layer, three&#8208;dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly,  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  can be viewed as assemblage of diamond&#8208;like Y structure and rare vertex&#8208;sharing tetrahedral P4 units. Impressively, electron&#8208;phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature  T  c  of 10.2 K among binary transition metal phosphides. Remarkably, the EPC of  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P mainly arises from the contribution of low&#8208;frequency soft phonon modes, whereas mid&#8208;frequency phonon modes of  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  dominate. These results strengthen knowledge of metal phosphides and pave a way for seeking superconductive transition metal phosphides.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion Chemistry of Lutetacyclopropene toward Unsaturated C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the reaction chemistry of transition metallacyclopropenes has been well&#8208;established in the last decades, the reactivity of rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopropenes remains elusive. Herein, we report the reaction of lutetacyclopropene  1  toward a series of unsaturated molecules. The reaction of  1  with one equiv of PhCOMe, Ar  1  CHO (Ar  1  = 2,6&#8208;Me  2  C  6  H  3  ), W(CO)  6  , and PhCH=NPh provided oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene,  and azalutetacyclopentene  via 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O, C&#8801;O, or C=N bonds into Lu&#8722;C  sp2  bond, respectively. However, the reaction between  1  and Ar  2  N=C=NAr  2  (Ar  2  = 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  ) gave an acyclic lutetium complex with a  diamidinate  ligand by the coupling of one molecule of  1  with two carbodiimides, irrespective of the amount of carbodiimide employed. More interestingly, when  1  was treated with two equiv of Ar  1  CHO, the reductive coupling of two C=O bonds was discovered to give a  lutetium pinacolate complex along with the release of tolan.&#160;  Remarkably, the reactivity of  1  is significantly different from that of scandacyclopropenes; these metallacycles derived from  1  all represent the first cases in rare&#8208;earth organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast detection of entacapone by a lanthanide&#8208;organic framework with rhombic channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entacapone (ENT) is a powerful catechol&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl transferase inhibitor that is used for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s syndrome, but the amount used must be well controlled to avoid overtreatment and side effect. Fast and selective detection of ENT needs well&#8208;matched energy levels and well&#8208;designed sensor&#8208;ENT interaction which is highly challenging. In this work, a water stable europium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (  Eu&#8208;TDA  ) was synthesized to detect ENT by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity in the presence of main coexisting and interference species of plasma with a limit of detection of 5.01 &#956;M. The experimental results showed that the luminescence of  Eu&#8208;TDA  can be effectively quenched by ENT via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect mechanism in the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing Reaction Pathways in Heterogeneously Catalysed Hydrogenation of Allyl Cyanide: The Chemical Nature of Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a mechanistic study on the formation of an active ligand layer over Pd(111), turning the catalytic surface highly active and selective in partial hydrogenation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Specifically, we investigate the chemical composition of a ligand layer consisting of allyl cyanide deposited on Pd(111) and its dynamic changes under the hydrogenation conditions. On pristine surface, allyl cyanide largely retains its chemical structure and forms a layer of molecular species with the CN bond oriented nearly parallel to the underlying metal. In the presence of hydrogen, the chemical composition of allyl cyanide strongly changes. At 100 K, allyl cyanide transfers to unsaturated imine species, containing the C=C and C=N double bonds. At increasing temperatures, these species undergo two competing reaction pathways. First, the C=C bond become hydrogenated and the stable N&#8208;butylimine species are produced. In the competing pathway, the unsaturated imine reacts with hydrogen to fully hydrogenate the imine group and produce butylamine. The latter species are unstable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions and desorb from the surface, while the N&#8208;butylimine adsorbates formed in the first reaction pathway remain adsorbed and act as an active ligand layer in selective hydrogenation of acrolein.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size Instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically analyzed element&#8211;element bonds of archetypal HnX&#8211;YHn&#160;molecules (X, Y = C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I), using density functional theory. One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e.g., from C&#8211;C to C&#8211;F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C&#8211;F to C&#8211;I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electro&#173;negativity difference.&#160;Instead, we show that the effective atom size is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance.&#160;We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on The Application of The Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi Reaction to The Synthesis of Novel Fluorinated Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New scaffolds obtained by Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich or fluorinated alkenes to give corresponding oxetanes. The uncommon regioselectivity with the fluorinated alkenes is explained by the relative stabilities of 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of this Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. A metathesis (photo&#8208;Wittig reaction) yields amide isosteres.







Abstract
In the context of new scaffolds obtained by photochemical reactions, Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich alkenes to give oxetanes are described. A comprehensive study has then been carried out on the reaction of aromatic ketones with fluorinated alkenes. Depending on the substitution pattern at the oxetane ring, a metathesis reaction is described as a minor side process to give mono fluorinated alkenes. Overall, this last reaction corresponds to a photo&#8208;Wittig reaction and yield amid isosteres. In order to explain the uncommon regioselectivity of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with these alkenes, electrostatic&#8208;potential derived charges (ESP) have been determined. In a second computational study, the relative stabilities of the typical 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction have been determined. The results well explain the regioselectivity. Further transformations of the oxetanes or previous functionalization of the fluoroalkenes open perspectives for oxetanes as core structures for biologically active compounds.

         <title>Study of a Stable &#8220;Trifluoromethoxide Anion Solution&#8221; Arising from 2,4&#8208;Dinitro&#8208;Trifluoromethoxybenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable solution of the trifluoromethoxide anion was readily obtained by mixing 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) and DMAP. A detailed study and characterization of this solution has been described, in particular highlighting the crucial role of the DNTFB/DMAP ratio. This &#8220;trifluoromethoxide anion solution&#8221; was applied to perform metal&#8208;free SN2 reactions on alkyl bomides with yields up to 77&#8201;%.







Abstract
Despite recent advances, trifluoromethoxylation remains a challenging reaction. Here we describe an efficient trifluoromethoxylative substitution, using an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagent. By mixing DMAP with a slight excess of 1,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB), a stable solution of trifluoromethoxide anion is obtained and can be used to perform a SN2 reaction without any silver additives. A precise study of the properties and behavior of this unusual stable solution of CF3O&#8722; species is also performed.

         <title>Structural and Photophysical Characterization of All Five Constitutional Isomers of the Octaethyl&#8208;&#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;bacterio&#8208; and &#8208;isobacteriochlorin Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single crystal structures, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, fluorescence emission properties, MCD spectra, and their singlet oxygen photosensitization properties of all octaethyl&#8208;&#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;porphyrin isomers are presented. DFT Computations reveal the underlying tautomeric equilibria and the strong electronic interactions of the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;functionalities with the porphyrinic &#960;&#8208;system. This contribution adds to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;auxochrome and lays the foundation for their further utilization.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that treatment of &#946;&#8208;octaethylporphyrin with H2O2/conc. H2SO4 converts it to a &#946;&#8208;oxochlorin as well as all five constitutional isomers of the corresponding &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;derivatives: two bacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo groups at opposite pyrrolic building blocks) and three isobacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;groups at adjacent pyrrolic building blocks). By virtue of the presence of the strongly electronically coupled &#946;&#8208;oxo auxochromes, none of the chromophores are archetypical chlorins, bacteriochlorins, or isobacteriochlorins. Here the authors present, inter alia, the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of all free&#8208;base diketone isomers and a comparative description of their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, and fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen photosensitization properties, Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra, and singlet excited state lifetimes. DFT computations uncover underlying tautomeric equilibria and electronic interactions controlling their electronic properties, adding to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying &#946;&#8208;oxo functionalities. This comparative study lays the basis for their further study and utilization.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Like Triarylamines with High Hole Mobility and On/Off Ratio in Bottom&#8208;Gated OFETs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Butterfly&#8208;like triarylamine dyads were synthesized through modified Sonogashira coupling reactions, which exhibit good solubility, thermal stability, and high charge carrier mobilities in OFET.







Abstract
Highly &#960;&#8208;extended butterfly&#8208;shaped triarylamine dyads with aryleneethynylene spacer were constructed using an efficient synthetic route. These aryleneethynylene&#8208;bridged dyads are highly fluorescent and exhibited high HOMO levels, and low bandgaps, which are suitable for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OFETs. The field&#8208;effect transistors were fabricated through a solution&#8208;processable method and exhibited promising p&#8208;type performance with field&#8208;effect mobility up to 4.3&#8197;cm2/Vs and high Ion/off of 108 under ambient conditions.

         <title>On the Roles of Electron Transfer in Catalysis by Nanoclusters and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various roles and functions of electron transfer in nanocatalysis, from H2 generation to materials and sustainable energy production, are all the more crucial and better managed as heterogeneous catalysts (nanoparticles and nanoclusters) now increasingly involve well&#8208;defined atomic and molecular components. The various aspects discussed in this minireview include NC&#8211;NPs as electron reservoirs, hydrogen production from water photocatalysis, electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;chain catalysis, Ullmann coupling, plasmonic hot electrons in photocatalysis, and, briefly, redox/electrocatalysis in energy conversion, water depollution and sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
Electron transfer plays a major role in chemical reactions and processes, and this is particularly true of catalysis by nanomaterials. The advent of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts, recently including atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs) as parts of nanocatalyst devices has brought increased control of the relationship between NP and NC structures and their catalytic functions. Consequently, the molecular definition of these new nanocatalysts has allowed a better understanding and management of various kinds of electron transfer involved in the catalytic processes. This Minireview brings a chemist&#8216;s view of several major aspects of electron&#8208;transfer functions concerning NPs and NCs in catalytic processes. Particular focus concerns the role of NPs and NCs as electron reservoirs and light&#8208;induced antenna in catalytic processes from H2 generation to more complex reactions and sustainable energy production.

         <title>A Pseudorotaxane System Containing &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Formed via Chiral Recognition with an AuI6AgI3CuII3 Molecular Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudorotaxanes are created from an AuI6AgI3CuII3 complex with d&#8208;penicillamine combined with dicarboxylate and &#947;&#8208;CD via a solvent&#8208;mediated crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. In the structure, a &#947;&#8208;CD ring is threaded by a dicarboxylate axle such that the smaller opening of &#947;&#8208;CD faces an AuI6AgI3CuII3 complex cap in a largely distorted manner. The corresponding complex with l&#8208;penicillamine does not accept a &#947;&#8208;CD ring in the structure.







Abstract

Soaking crystals of d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ in aqueous Na2bdc (bdc2&#8722;=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) yielded crystals containing d&#8208;[1(bdc)(H2O)2]+ due to the replacement of a terminal aqua ligand in d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ by a monodentate bdc2&#8722; ligand. When &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) was added to aqueous Na2bdc, d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ was transformed to d&#8208;[1(bdc@&#947;&#8208;CD)(H2O)2]+, where a &#947;&#8208;CD ring was threaded by a bdc2&#8722; molecule to construct a pseudorotaxane structure. While the use of dicarboxylates with an aliphatic carbon chain instead of bdc2&#8722; afforded analogous pseudorotaxanes, such pseudorotaxane species were not formed when crystals of [Au6Ag3Cu3(H2O)3(l&#8208;pen)6(tdme)2]3+ (l&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+) enantiomeric to d&#8208;[1(H2O)3]3+ were soaked in aqueous Na2bdc and &#947;&#8208;CD, affording only crystals containing l&#8208;[1(bdc)(H2O)2]+.

         <title>Autotandem Catalysis: Inexpensive and Green Access to Functionalized Ketones by Intermolecular Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Amidoalkynylation/Hydration Cascade Reaction via N&#8208;Acyliminium Ion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autotandem catalysis: Iron(III) catalysts were shown to efficiently catalyze intermolecular alkynylation reactions of various alkoxy, acetoxylactams, and hydroxylactams. This chemistry broadens the scope of iron catalysis by highlighting new aspects of iron salts &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity. More importantly, this approach is amenable to an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence affording expedient access to a new carbonyl structures.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts were applied in cascade&#8208;type reactions for the synthesis of different carbonyl compounds. The reactions proceeded by a new iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade of alkynylation/hydration by using both the &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Lewis acid properties of iron salts. The alkynylation reactions of several endo and exocyclic acetoxylactams were achieved with three different catalysts including FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, FeCl3, and Fe(OTf)3 showing the efficiency of &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity of iron (III) salts in catalyzing the alkynylation reaction. We also demonstrated that the reaction sequence could be shortened by the direct use of hydroxylactams, leading to an environmentally friendly protocol, avoiding the need to perform unnecessary lengthy steps. A combination of the hard/soft iron Lewis acid properties was then used to implement an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence allowing expedient access to a new carbonyl structures from trivial materials.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed CO&#8208;free carbonylative synthesis of 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives was developed. This new method employed readily available N&#8208;(o&#8208;bromoaryl)amides as the starting materials and inexpensive benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl triformate (TFBen) as the stable solid CO surrogate, which would not cause hydrodehalogenation of the starting materials. Remarkably, this method featured a very broad substrate scope and was especially useful for incorporation benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one structure into drugs and naturally biologically active compounds.







Abstract
A facile synthesis of 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives by Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between N&#8208;(ortho&#8208;bromoaryl)amides and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl triformate (TFBen) was developed. This procedure does not require the toxic and flammable gas CO as the carbonyl source and tolerates a wide scope of functional groups. Remarkably, 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones incorporated to natural products and drugs can be constructed by this method.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Dependent Peroxidase Mimicking Enzyme Activity of Copper Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, three different morphology (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) of Cu&#8208;MOP assemblies were obtained by adjusting binary solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;Dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol. Experimental results revealed that the Cu&#8208;MOPs nanofibers morphology with the highest peroxidase mimetic activity among these three assemblies, which is benefited for establishing the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. The present study constitutes a facile step toward the development of modulation of morphology and functionality of MOP for biomedical application.







Abstract
The morphology of nanomaterials (geometric shape and dimension) play a significant role in its various physical and chemical properties. Thus, it is essential to link morphology with performance in specific applications. For this purpose, the morphology of copper metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (Cu&#8208;MOP) can be modulated through distinct assembly process, which facilitates the exploration of the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. In this work, the assemblies of Cu&#8208;MOP with three different morphologies (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) were facilely prepared by the variation of solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, revealed the important role of the interaction between the surface group and the solvent on the morphology of these assemblies. Cu&#8208;MOP nanofibers exhibited the highest mimetic peroxidase enzyme activity over the Cu&#8208;MOP nanosheets and nanorods, which have been utilized in the detection of glucose. Cu&#8208;MOPs assemblies with tunable morphology accompanied with adjustable mimic peroxidase activity, had great potential applications in the field of bioanalytical chemistry and biomedicals.

         <title>Rational Design of a Confacial Pentaoctahedron: Anisotropic Exchange in a Linear ZnIIFeIIIFeIIIFeIIIZnII Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first linear pentanuclear transition metal complex comprised of five face&#8208;sharing octahedra &#8211; a confacial pentaoctahedron &#8211; has been designed using a dinucleating nonadentate ligand providing an N3O3 and an O6 ligand compartments. The confacial pentaoctahedron ZnIIFeIIIFeIIIFeIIIZnII has been synthesized by using two in&#8197;situ generated dinuclear ZnIIFeIII metallo ligands. The face&#8208;sharing bridging motive enforces short ZnIIFeIII and FeIIIFeIII distances of 2.83 and 2.72&#8197;&#197;, respectively, resulting in anisotropic ferromagnetic interactions.







Abstract
The first confacial pentaoctahedron comprised of transition metal ions namely ZnIIFeIIIAFeIIIBFeIIIAZnII has been synthesized by using a dinucleating nonadentate ligand. The face&#8208;sharing bridging mode enforces short ZnII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;FeIIIA and FeIIIA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;FeIIIB distances of 2.83 and 2.72&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Ab&#8208;initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations provide significant negative zero&#8208;field splittings for FeIIIA and FeIIIB with |DA|&gt;|DB| with the main component along the C3 axis. Hence, a spin&#8208;Hamiltonian comprised of anisotropic exchange, zero&#8208;field, and Zeeman term was employed. This allowed by following the boundary conditions from the theoretical results the simulation in a theory&#8208;guided parameter determination with Jxy=+0.37, Jz=&#8722;0.32, DA=&#8722;1.21, EA=&#8722;0.24, DB=&#8722;0.35, and EB=&#8722;0.01&#8197;cm&#8722;1 supported by simulations of high&#8208;field magnetic M&#246;ssbauer spectra recorded at 2&#8197;K. The weak but ferromagnetic FeIIIAFeIIIB interaction arises from the small bridging angle of 84.8&#176; being at the switch from anti&#8208; to ferromagnetic for the face&#8208;sharing bridging mode.

         <title>Quenched Lewis Acidity: Studies on the Medium Dependent Fluorescence of Zinc(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new zinc(II) coordination units based on Schiff base&#8208;like ligands equipped with nitrile groups were synthesized. In non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as chloroform, a close&#8208;to&#8208;zero emission was observed; this increased drastically upon addition of the Lewis base pyridine (&#934;=15&#8201;%). Interestingly, DFT calculations indicate that the intrinsically high Lewis&#8208;acidity of the zinc(II) metal center is hidden through formation of highly stable dimers.







Abstract
Three new zinc(II) coordination units [Zn(1&#8211;3)] based on planar&#8208;directing tetradentate Schiff base&#8208;like ligands H2(1&#8211;3) were synthesized. Their solid&#8208;state structures were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing the tendency to overcome the square&#8208;planar coordination sphere by axial ligation. Affinity in solution towards axial ligation has been tested by extended spectroscopic studies, both in the absorption and emission mode. The electronic spectrum of the pyridine complex [Zn(1)(py)] has been characterized by MC&#8208;PDFT to validate the results of extended TD&#8208;DFT studies. Green emission of non&#8208;emissive solutions of [Zn(1&#8211;3)] in chloroform could be switched on in the presence of potent Lewis&#8208;bases. While interpretation in terms of an equilibrium of stacked/non&#8208;fluorescent and destacked/fluorescent species is in line with precedents from literature, the sensitivity of [Zn(1&#8211;3)] was greatly reduced. Results of a computation&#8208;based structure search allow to trace the hidden Lewis acidity of [Zn(1&#8211;3)] to a new stacking motif, resulting in a strongly enhanced stability of the dimers.

         <title>A Titanium and Tantalum Phosphate LiNaTiTa2P2O13 with An Open Framework hosting Li and Na Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiNaTiTa2P2O13 displays an open framework comprised of staggered [Ti1/3Ta2/3O3]&#8734; layers and PO4 tetrahedra with a herringbone&#8208;like stacking pattern, similar to monophosphate niobium bronzes. The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li+ and Na+ ions, endow LiNaTiTa2P2O13 a moderate ion transport capability (4.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 823&#8197;K). In addition, the layers constituted by corner&#8208;sharing TiO6 and TaO6 octahedra endow a possibility as being photo&#8208;catalyst. The successful substitution of Nb for Ta results in the optical absorption red&#8208;shifted towards visible range with a narrowing band gap comparable to that of TiO2 (3.2&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Herein, we report a detailed structural, electric, thermal and optical analysis of a titanium and tantalum phosphate LiNaTiTa2P2O13. The title compound is comprised of typical ReO3&#8208;type layers constituted by corner&#8208;sharing TiO6 and TaO6 octahedra, bridged by PO4 tetrahedra, and the structure is closely related to monophosphate niobium bronzes. The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li+ and Na+ ions, endows LiNaTiTa2P2O13 a moderate ion transportation behavior (4.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 823&#8197;K). In addition, the successful substitution of Nb for Ta in LiNaTiTa2P2O13 results in the optical absorption red&#8208;shift towards visible range with a narrowing band gap, which may provide a route of isomorphic replacement to band engineering for photo&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Supported CuII Single&#8208;Ion Catalyst for Total Carbon Utilization of C2 and C3 Biomass&#8208;Based Platform Molecules in the N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upgrading biomass without waste: Scientists from Rostock and Lanzhou have, for the first time, succeeded in directly converting C2&#8722;C3 biomass molecules with amines and H2O2 to industrially important formamides by valorizing all carbon atoms of the substrates without producing undesired by&#8208;products. The reaction is catalyzed under very mild conditions by a 5A zeolite with active CuII single sites; .NHPh and .OOH radicals play a key role. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Br&#252;ckner, F.&#8197;Shi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102300).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upgrading biomass without waste&lt;/b&gt;: Scientists from Rostock and Lanzhou have, for the first time, succeeded in directly converting C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; biomass molecules with amines and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to industrially important formamides by valorizing all carbon atoms of the substrates without producing undesired by-products. The reaction is catalyzed under very mild conditions by a 5A zeolite with active Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; single sites; &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;NHPh and &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OOH radicals play a key role.

         <title>Hybrid EuIII Coordination Luminophore Standing on Two Legs on Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;legged, standing&#8208;up molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent EuIII&#8211;silica nanomaterials is demonstrated. By using a Eu(hfa)3 complex with TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)3 (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) covalently bonded to the silica nanoparticles at two binding sites, nanoluminophores Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8208;Si)2&#8211;SiO2 were developed that have an excellent intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93%) and long emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms).

         <title>Photoinduced Water Oxidation in Chitosan Nanostructures Containing Covalently Linked RuII Chromophores and Encapsulated Iridium Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber gels made of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;decorated chitosan and incorporating IrO2 nanoparticles (see SEM image in the background) can effectively perform photoinduced water oxidation with better performance than isolated components. In particular, a significantly higher quantum yield for water oxidation and a better stability of the system are reported.

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of Tunable Aryl Alkyl Ionic Liquids (TAAILs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;alkyl imidazolium ionic liquids (tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids, TAAILs) with electron withdrawing and electron donating substituents on the phenyl ring of the cation, various alkyl chain lengths and the bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiNTf2) anion have been prepared. Their physical properties, such as melting points, thermal decomposition, viscosity and electrochemical window, are described to give a broad overview of this class of organic salts.







Abstract
Tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) based on the imidazolium cation were first reported in 2009. Since then, a series of TAAILs with different properties due to the electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing effect of the substituents at the aryl ring has been developed. Herein, a wide variety of those ionic liquids (ILs) is presented in terms of their cation structure. The authors synthesized ILs containing the bromide or bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide anion and 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;alkyl imidazolium cations with various substituents in the ortho and/ or para position of the phenyl ring and alkyl chains of different lengths varying from butyl to dodecyl. The differences of their physical properties (melting point, thermal decomposition, viscosity, electro&#8208;chemical window) of these ILs are reported according to their structure.

Since then, a series of TAAILs with different properties due to the electron-donating or -withdrawing effect of the substituents at the aryl ring has been developed. Herein, a wide variety of those ionic liquids (ILs) is presented in terms of their cation structure. The authors synthesized ILs containing the bromide or bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide anion and 1-aryl-3-alkyl imidazolium cations with various substituents in the ortho and/ or para position of the phenyl ring and alkyl chains of different lengths varying from butyl to dodecyl.

Explaining the oxidation&#8211;cyclization mechanism of heterocycles containing Te&#8722;O bonds. The structures of halogenated Te&#8208;containing heterocycles have been elucidated, and computational methods showed them to be prepared in a two&#8208;step oxidation&#8211;cyclization. The three compounds shown represent both the structural diversity and the biological application of these hypervalent compounds as leishmanicides.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical enabled three component cascade phosphorylation of carbazoles, indoles,phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph2PH has been well developed. A variety of organophosphorus compounds containing P(O)&#8722;X ( X=N, O, S) bonds are produced in moderate to excellent yields (50 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
An electrochemical three component cascade phosphorylation reaction of various heteroatoms&#8208;containing nucleophiles including carbazoles, indoles, phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph2PH has been established. Electricity is used as the &#8220;traceless&#8221; oxidant and water and air are utilized as the &#8220;green&#8221; oxygen source. All kinds of structurally diverse organophosphorus compounds with P(O)&#8208;N/P(O)&#8208;O/P(O)&#8208;S bonds are assembled in moderate to excellent yields (three categories of phosphorylation products, 50 examples, up to 97&#8201;% yield). A tentative free radical course is put forward to rationalize the reaction procedure.

         <title>SnS Nanosheets for Rapid and Effective Bacteria Sterilization Under Near&#8208;infrared Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively is very urgent. SnS nanosheets are synthesized using a simple solvothermal method. SnS nanosheets generate heat as well as reactive oxygen species such as .OH, .O2&#8722; and 1O2 under near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Therefore, SnS nanosheets effectively inhibit the growth of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through the synergistic effect of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Today, the threat of pathogenic bacterial infection worldwide that leads to the increase of mortality rate strongly demands the development of new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively. Although there are a lot of antibacterial agents that have been developed so far, few studies on the antibacterial performance of SnS have been investigated at 808&#8197;nm laser. Here, we synthesized SnS nanosheets with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption performance and excellent antibacterial performance via a simple solvothermal synthesis route. The as&#8208;prepared SnS nanosheets showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (38.7&#8201;%), photodynamic performance, and photostability, and at the same time 99.98&#8201;% and 99.7&#8201;% sterilization effect against Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) under near&#8208;infrared irradiation (808&#8197;nm, 1.5&#8197;W/cm2). This study suggests that SnS nanosheets could be a promising candidate for antibacterial therapy owing to the synergetic effects of photothermal and photodynamic performance.

         <title>Photophysics of Azobenzene Constrained in a UiO Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Effects of Pressure, Solvation and Dynamic Disorder</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putting the pressure on azobenzene photophysics: When locked in a UiO metal&#8211;organic framework, the azobenzene chromophore is geometrically constrained but exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. This is a unique and advantageous environment in which to explore fundamental photophysical properties. Optical spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell enables the photophysical consequences of pressure&#8208;induced changes in solvation and conformation of the chromophore to be observed and correlated with crystallographic data.







Abstract
Photophysical studies of chromophoric linkers in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are undertaken commonly in the context of sensing applications, in search of readily observable changes of optical properties in response to external stimuli. The advantages of the MOF construct as a platform for investigating fundamental photophysical behaviour have been somewhat overlooked. The linker framework offers a unique environment in which the chromophore is geometrically constrained and its structure can be determined crystallographically, but it exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure studies enable the photophysical consequences of controlled, incremental changes in local environment or conformation to be observed and correlated with structural data. This approach is demonstrated in the present study of the trans&#8208;azobenzene chromophore, constrained in the form of the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azobenzenedicarboxylate (abdc) linker, in a UiO topology framework. Previously unobserved effects of pressure&#8208;induced solvation and conformational distortion on the lowest energy, n&#960;* transition are reported, and interpreted the light of crystallographic data. It was found that trans&#8208;azobenzene remains non&#8208;fluorescent (with a quantum yield less than 10&#8722;4) despite the prevention of trans&#8208;cis isomerization by the constraining MOF structure. We propose that efficient non&#8208;radiative decay is mediated by the local, pedal&#8208;like twisting of the azo group that is evident as dynamic disorder in the crystal structure.

         <title>NMR Crystallography Enhanced by Quantum Chemical Calculations and Liquid State NMR for the Investigation of Se NHC Adducts.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N

heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) are widely utilized in catalysis and material science. They are characterized by their steric and electronic properties. Steric properties are usually quantified on the basis of their static structure, which can be determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic properties are estimated in the liquid state; for example, via the 77Se liquid state NMR of Se&#8208;NHC adducts. We demonstrate that 77Se NMR crystallography can contribute to the characterization of the structural and electronic properties of NHC in solid and liquid states. Selected Se&#8208;NHC adducts are investigated via 77Se solid state NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography, supported by quantum chemical calculations. This investigation reveals a correlation between the molecular structure of adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts but also the other chemical shift tensor components. Afterwards, the liquid state 77Se NMR data is presented and interpreted in terms of the quantum chemistry modelling. The discrepancy between the structural and electronic properties, and in particular the &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities of adducts in the solid and liquid states is discussed. Finally, the 13C isotropic chemical shift from the liquid state NMR and the 13C tensor components are also discussed, and compared with their 77Se counterparts. 77Se NMR crystallography can deliver valuable information about NHC ligands, and together with liquid state 77Se NMR can provide an in&#8208;depth outlook on the properties of NHC ligands.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N&#8208;containing 4n&#960;&#8208;electron systems that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene moiety resulted in the much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the 8&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;periphery caused by the stabilization of the less&#8208;stable bond&#8208;shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H  2  &#8208;TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;&#8208;stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine(I) and Silver(I) Complexes of Benzoimidazole and Pyridylcarbazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of iodine(I) complexes with either benzoimidazole or carbazole&#8208;derived  sp  2  N  &#8208;containing Lewis bases is described, as well as their corresponding silver(I) complexes. The addition of elemental iodine to the linear two&#8208;coordinate Ag(I) complexes produces iodine(I) complexes with a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bond. The  1  H and  1  H&#8208;  15  N HMBC NMR studies unambiguously confirm the formation of the complexes in all cases via the [N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N]  +  &#8594; [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  cation exchange, with the  15  N NMR chemical shift change between 94 to 111 ppm when compared to the free ligand. The single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on four I  +  complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bonds with I &#8212; N bond distances of 2.21 &#8208; 2.26 &#197; and N &#8212; I &#8212; N angles of 177 &#8208; 180 &#176; , whilst some of the corresponding Ag  +  complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N angles of ca. 150 &#176; and Ag &#8212; N bond distances of 2.09 &#8208; 2.18 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>Push&#8210;Pull Stiff&#8208;Stilbene: Proton&#8208;Gated Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitching and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor substituted stiff&#8208;stilbene is shown to undergo isomerization induced by visible light avoiding the need for harmful UV light. This visible&#8208;light photoswitching is inhibited by protonation of the dimethylamino&#8208;donor unit, disrupting the push&#8208;pull character and thus, gating of the photochromic properties is allowed by acid/base addition. Remarkably, the addition of a mild acid also triggers fast thermal back isomerization, which is unprecedented for stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitches usually having a very high energy barrier for this process. These combined features offer unique orthogonal control over switching behavior by light and protonation, which is investigated in detail by  1  H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. In addition, TD&#8208;DFT calculations are used to gain further insight into the absorption properties. Our results will help elevating the level of control over dynamic behavior in stiff&#8208;stilbene applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Chiral Exciplexes with Sky&#8208;Blue and Green Circularly Polarized &#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorecence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent exciplexes based on a chiral electron donor molecule and achiral acceptor ones are reported as a new approach to design circularly polarized (CP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters.&#160; This innovative strategy results in rather high CP luminescence values with g lum up to 7 &#180; 10 &#8208;3 , almost one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the CPL signal recorded for the chiral donor alone ( g lum ~ 8 &#180; 10 &#8208;4 ). This increase occurs concomitantly to a CPL sign inversion, as a result of the strong charge&#8208;transfer emission character, as experimentally and theoretically rationalized using a covalent chiral Donor&#8208;Acceptor model. Interestingly, blue, green&#8208;yellow and red chiral luminescent exciplexes can be obtained by playing with the electron accepting character of the achiral unit while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks with novel catenane&#8208;like interlocking: metal&#8208;determined photoresponse and uranyl sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of two tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate ligands and different metal ions leads to seven isostructural MOFs, which show novel 2D&#174;2D supramolecular entanglement featuring catenane&#8208;like interlocking of tricyclic cages. The MOFs show tripyridinium&#8208;afforded and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties. The MOFs with d  10  metal centers (  1&#8208;Cd, 1&#8208;Zn, 2&#8208;Cd, 2&#8208;Zn)  show fast and reversible photochromism and concomitant fluorescence quenching,  1&#8208;Ni  displays slower photochromism but does not fluoresce, and  1&#8208;Co  and  2&#8208;Co  are neither photochromic nor fluorescent. We show that the network entanglement dictates donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which enable fluorescence originated from interligand charge transfer. The contacts also allow photoinduced electron transfer, which underlies photochromism and concomitant fluorescence response. The metal dependence in fluorescence and photochromism can be related to energy transfer through metal&#8208;centered  d&#8208;d  transitions. In addition,  1&#8208;Cd  is demonstrated to be a potential fluorescence sensor for sensitive and selective detection of UO  2  2+  in water</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The high theoretical specific capacity, strong structural designability and relatively inexpensive manufacturing cost make the exploration of organic electrode materials more attractive in recent years. In this article, owing to the large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, plenty of nitrogen heteroatoms and multiring aromatic system, polyazaacene analogue poly(1,6&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,8&#8208;triyl&#8208;7&#8208;(2 H  )&#8208;ylidene&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethylidene) (PQL) was applied as the anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). PQL was almost insoluble in conventional liquid organic electrolyte (1 M NaClO 4  in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (v:v=1:1) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)), which strongly improved its cycle stability. The initial discharge capacity was obtained to be 1825 mAh g &#8208;1  at the current density of 100 mA g &#8208;1  and stabilized at 317 mAh g &#8208;1  after 400 cycles with the coulombic efficiency as high as 97%. It not only showed good rate capability at high current densities (202, 183 mAh g &#8208;1  at 1 A g &#8208;1  and 1.5 A g &#8208;1  ) but also had a superior energy density around 290 Wh kg &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal ligand and packing effects on slow relaxation in an isostructural set of [Dy(H2dapp)X2]+ Single Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report three structurally related single ion Dy compounds using the pentadentate ligand 2,6&#8208;bis((  E  )&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;hydrazineylidene)ethyl)pyridine (H  2  dapp)  (1)  [Dy(H  2  dapp)(NO  3  )  2  ]NO  3  ,  (2)  [Dy(H  2  dapp)(AcO)  2  ]Cl and [Dy(H  2  dapp)(NO  3  )  2  ]Cl  0.92  (NO  3  )  0.08  (3)  . The (H  2  dapp) occupies a helical twisted pentagonal equatorial arrangement with two anionic ligands in the axial positions. Further influence on the electronic and magnetic structure is provided by a closely associated counterion interacting with the central N&#8208;H group of the (H  2  dapp). The slow relaxation of the magnetisation shows that the anionic acetates give the greatest slowing down of the magnetisation reversal. Further influence on the relaxation properties of compounds  (1)  and  (2)  is the presence of short nitrate&#8208;nitrate intermolecular ligand contact opening further lattice relaxation pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; Halogen Bonding between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides an overview on halogen bonding (the noncovalent interaction between Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases) between ions of like charge. Next to theoretical studies, experimental examples in the solid state and in solution are covered and a comparison with other interactions is provided.







Abstract
Halogen bonding occurs between molecules featuring Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases. It is often rationalized as a predominantly electrostatic interaction and thus interactions between ions of like charge (e.&#8201;g., of anionic halogen bond donors with halides) seem counter&#8208;intuitive. Herein, we provide an overview on such complexes. First, theoretical studies are described and their findings are compared. Next, experimental evidences are presented in the form of crystal structure database analyses, recent examples of strong &#8220;anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonding in crystals, and the observation of such interactions also in solution. We then compare these complexes to select examples of &#8220;counter&#8208;intuitive&#8221; adducts formed by other interactions, like hydrogen bonding. Finally, we comment on key differences between charge&#8208;transfer and electrostatic polarization.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydroarylation of 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;Butadienes with Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective hydroarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aryl halides and using silanes as hydride source is developed, affording functionalized arenes in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. The protocol shows a high tolerance to various functional groups on both the dienes and aryl coupling partners. Mechanism studies indicate that &#960;&#8208;allyl nickel species is likely to be involved in the catalysis.







Abstract
An efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective hydroarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aryl halides and a silane has been developed, affording a range of allylic arenes in good to excellent yields under mild conditions. This method exhibits broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Late&#8208;stage modification of complex architectures was demonstrated.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Containing Carbadecaphyrins: Non&#8208;aromatic Expanded Porphyrins that Undergo Proton&#8208;Triggered Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of meso&#8208;free expanded carbaporphyrins containing carbazole as key structural elements have been prepared. By judicious choice of acid, access to three distinct structural forms in the solid state. No evidence of global aromaticity was observed in any of the forms. Notably, both macrocycles in their protonated forms exhibit substantial absorbance in the NIR region resulting in a panchromatic absorption that extends up to 1200&#8197;nm.







Abstract
A pair of meso&#8208;unsubstituted expanded carbaporphyrins containing two carbazole moieties were prepared in high isolated yields (82 and 76&#8201;%, respectively). The two macrocycles, namely 3 and 4, differ with respect to their substitution at the carbazole N&#8208;atoms i.&#8201;e. by H and i&#8208;Bu, respectively. As prepared in their free&#8208;base forms, macrocycles 3 and 4 adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformations and are best characterized as 40 &#960;&#8208;electron, non&#8208;aromatic species possessing a decaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) skeleton. Protonation of 3 with either trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or perchloric acid (HClO4) produces a parallelogram&#8208;shaped structure. A similar structure is produced when N&#8208;functionalized system 4 is treated with TFA. In contrast, protonation of 4 with HClO4 leads it to adopt a twisted M&#246;bius strip&#8208;like structure in the solid state, thus allowing access to three distinct conformational states as a function of the conditions.

         <title>Macrocyclic Inorganic Tin&#8208;Containing Oxo Clusters: Heterometallic Strategy for Configuration and Catalytic Activity Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented macrocyclic inorganic tin&#8208;containing oxo clusters have been successfully constructed, whose configuration, host&#8208;guest behaviors, supramolecular packing and catalytic activities are significantly modulated by the introduction of heterometals with different ionic radius.







Abstract
In this work, the first examples of inorganic macrocyclic tin&#8208;oxo clusters which are stabilized by sulfate ligands are reported. As determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, the prepared inorganic Sn10&#8208;oxo cluster displays interesting mixed valence behaviors, with 8 Sn4+ located at the cyclic skeleton and two Sn2+ encapsulated in the center. When further introducing Ti4+ and In3+ ions to the synthetic systems, heterometallic Sn2Ti6 and SnIn5Ti6 complexes with Ti6(SO4)9 and SnIn5(SO4)12 macrocyclic skeletons were prepared whose configuration and packing models were affected by the ionic radius of incorporated metals. Moreover, comparative CO2 reduction experiments confirm that such heterometallic composition can significantly improve the catalytic activities of these inorganic macrocyclic oxo clusters. This work represents a milestone in constructing inorganic tin complexes and also macrocyclic metal oxo clusters with tunable configurations and properties.

         <title>Tuning the Intrinsic Activity and Electrochemical Surface Area of MoS2 via Tiny Zn Doping: Toward an Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;doped MoS2 with S vacancies (Zn&#8722;Vs&#8722;MoS2, 1T phase) was developed for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Zn doping not only effectively increases the electrochemical specific surface area of MoS2 but also induces the formation of HER active 1T/2H&#8722;MoS2 phase and defects. Furthermore, it activates the in&#8208;plane sites of 1T&#8722;MoS2 so that the density of active sites and the intrinsic activity of reactive sites can be increased simultaneously. Therefore, the improved HER activity and stability are finally achieved.







Abstract
Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is considered as an alternative material for commercial platinum catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Improving the apparent HER activity of MoS2 to a level comparable to that of Pt is an essential premise for the commercial use of MoS2. In this work, a Zn&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to enhance the HER performance of MoS2. It is shown that tiny Zn doping into MoS2 leads to the enhancement of the electrochemical surface area, increases in proportion of HER active 1T phase in the material and formation of catalytic sites of higher intrinsic activity. These benefits result in a high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV(@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low Tafel slope of 58&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The origin for the excellent electrochemical performance of the doped MoS2 is rationalized with both experimental and theoretical investigations.

         <title>The Introduction of a Cysteine Residue Modulates The Mechanical Properties of Aromatic&#8208;Based Solid Aggregates and Self&#8208;Supporting Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels based on aromatic peptides can be generated taking advantages from &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bondings between the side chain of amino acids. The insertion of a crosslinkable cysteine residue in the middle of the peptide motif could allow the achievement of novel materials with improved mechanical properties for tissue engineering applications.







Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based hydrogels, originated by multiscale self&#8208;assembling phenomenon, have been proposed as multivalent tools in different technological areas. Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations pointed out the capability of completely aromatic peptides to gelificate if hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces are opportunely balanced. Here, the effect produced by the introduction of a Cys residue in the heteroaromatic sequence of (FY)3 and in its PEGylated variant was evaluated. The physicochemical characterization indicates that both FYFCFYF and PEG8&#8208;FYFCFYF are able to self&#8208;assemble in supramolecular nanostructures whose basic cross&#8208;&#946; motif resembles the one detected in the ancestor (FY)3 assemblies. However, gelification occurs only for FYFCFYF at a concentration of 1.5&#8197;wt%. After cross&#8208;linking of cysteine residues, the hydrogel undergoes to an improvement of the rigidity compared to the parent (FY)3 assemblies as suggested by the storage modulus (G&#8217;) that increases from 970 to 3360&#8197;Pa. The mechanical properties of FYFCFYF are compatible with its potential application in bone tissue regeneration. Moreover, the avalaibility of a Cys residue in the middle of the peptide sequence could allow the hydrogel derivatization with targeting moieties or with biologically relevant molecules.

         <title>Nanoparticles for Triple Drug Release for Combined Chemo&#8208; and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to strict regulatory standards, it is unlikely that complex drug delivery systems can one day be translated into the clinic. The aim of this work is to develop a facile procedure for the preparation of a DDS based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the delivery of three anticancer drugs (doxorubicin (DOX), camptothecin (CPT), and zinc(II) phthalocyanine (Pc)) with different modes of action (combination chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)) following a convergent strategy.







Abstract
A pH&#8208;responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has been prepared for the delivery of three anticancer drugs with different modes of action. The novelty of this system is its ability to combine synergistic chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. A photoactive conjugate of a phthalocyanine (Pc) and a topoisomerase I inhibitor (topo&#8208;I), namely camptothecin (CPT), linked by a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain has been synthesized and then loaded into the mesopores of MSNs. Doxorubicin (DOX), which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor (topo&#8208;II), has also been covalently anchored to the outer surface of the MSNs through a dihydrazide PEG linker. In the acidic environment of tumor cells, selective release of the three drugs takes place. In vitro studies have demonstrated the endocytosis of the system into HeLa and HepG2 cells, and the subsequent release of the three drugs into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of DOX, CPT and Pc has been assessed in&#8197;vitro before and upon light irradiation.

         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 8&#8208;aminoquinolin&#8208;derived benzamides with aliphatic carboxylic acids is described. This reaction goes through 8&#8208;aminoquinolin&#8208;directed C&#8722;H acylation of benzamides using acyl fluorides generated by carboxylic acids as carbonyl sources and concomitant conversion of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;derived amide into lactone. This synthetic method exhibited broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity for Z&#8208;isomers.







Abstract
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;derived benzamides with aliphatic acyl fluorides generated in&#8197;situ from the corresponding acids has been developed. This reaction initiated with 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation, which was accompanied by subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution of amide group to produce alkylidene phthalides This approach exhibits high stereo&#8208;selectivity for Z&#8208;isomer products, and tolerates a variety of functional groups as well as aliphatic carboxylic acids with diverse structural scaffolds.

         <dc:description>On the basis of cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene ( CTX ), a novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based CTX derivative ( WPCTX ) was prepared with facile synthetic procedure and satisfying yield. Several model guest molecules were selected to investigate WPCTX 's host&#8208;guest properties. Based on the study of the host and model guest complexation, a tetraphenylethylene derivative from model guest was employed as a guest molecule ( G ) to form WPCTX &#8835; G nanoparticles (NPs) with WPCTX through further supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in water. Moreover, the hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Eosin Y ( ESY ) or Nile red ( NiR ), was encapsulated in WPCTX &#8835; G NPs, respectively, to construct two types of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems. Their high antenna effect demonstrated such NPs successfully mimicked light&#8208;harvesting system in nature.</dc:description>

Moreover, the hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Eosin Y ( ESY ) or Nile red ( NiR ), was encapsulated in WPCTX &#8835; G NPs, respectively, to construct two types of artificial light-harvesting systems. Their high antenna effect demonstrated such NPs successfully mimicked light-harvesting system in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox isomerization/(3 + 2) allenoate annulation by auto&#8208;tandem phosphine catalysis.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine catalyzed approach to pyrrolines has been developed that involves two mechanistically unlinked catalytic processes. The first involves the redox isomerization of amino crotonates to provide access to aliphatic tosyl imines, which then engage in a (3 + 2) annulation with various allenoates. The reaction shows generality, with 24 examples established, along with a low yielding and moderately enantioselective variant. Mechanistic studies indicate that the viability of the process is linked to the selection of catalysts with similar propensity to add to the two coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>The Roles of Composition and Mesostructure of Cobalt&#8208;based Spinel Catalysts in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the crystalline precursor decomposition approach and direct co&#8208;precipitation the composition and mesostructure of cobalt&#8208;based spinels can be controlled. A systematic substitution of cobalt with redox&#8208;active iron and redox&#8208;inactive magnesium and aluminum in a cobalt spinel with anisotropic particle morphology with a preferred 111 surface termination is presented, resulting in a substitution series including Co  3  O  4  , MgCo  2  O  4  , Co  2  FeO  4  , Co  2  AlO  4  and CoFe  2  O  4  . The role of redox pairs in the spinels is investigated in chemical water oxidation using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN test), electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H  2  O  2  decomposition. Studying the effect of dominant surface termination, isotropic Co  3  O  4  and CoFe  2  O  4  catalysts with more or less spherical particles are compared to their anisotropic analogs. For CAN&#8208;test and OER, Co  3+  plays the major role for high activity. In H  2  O  2  decomposition, Co  2+  reveals itself to be of major importance. Redox active cations in the structure enhance the catalytic activity in all reactions. A benefit of a predominant 111 surface termination depends on the cobalt oxidation state in the as&#8208;prepared catalysts and the investigated reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Boundaries between Lewis&#8208;Basic and Redox Behavior of a Parent Borylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parent borylene (CAAC)(Me3P)BH,  1  (CAAC = cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene), acts both as a Lewis base and one&#8208;electron reducing agent towards group 13 trichlorides (ECl3  , E = B, Al, Ga, In), yielding the adducts  1&#8208;ECl  3  and increasing proportions of the radical cation  [1]  &#8226;+  for the heavier group 13 analogues. With boron trihalides (BX3, X = F, Cl, Br, I)  1  undergoes sequential adduct formation and halide abstraction reactions to yield borylboronium cations and shows an increasing tendency towards redox processes for the heavier halides. Calculations confirm that  1  acts as a strong Lewis base towards EX3  and show a marked increase in the B&#8211;E bond dissociation energies down both group 13 and the halide group.</dc:description>

         <title>A Perspective on Heterogeneous Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of higher alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts is an important reaction in the synthesis of fine chemicals with added value. Though the process for primary alcohol oxidation is industrially established, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding considering the complexity of the catalysts and their dynamics under reaction conditions, especially when higher alcohols and liquid&#8208;phase reaction media are involved. Additionally, new materials should be developed offering higher activity, selectivity, and stability. This can be achieved by unraveling the structure&#8210;performance correlations of these catalysts under reaction conditions. In this regard, researchers are encouraged to develop more advanced characterization techniques to address the complex interplay between the solid surface, the dissolved reactants, and the solvent. In this mini&#8208;review, we report some of the most important approaches taken in the field and give a perspective on how to tackle the complex challenges for different approaches in alcohol oxidation while providing insight into the remaining challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Control of Perylene Supramolecular Polymers through Imide Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number and type of new supramolecular polymer (SMP) systems have increased rapidly in recent years. Some of the key challenges faced for these novel systems include gaining full control over the mode of self&#8208;assembly, the creation of novel architectures and exploring functionality. Here we provide a critical overview of approaches related to perylene&#8208;based SMPs and discuss progress to exert control over these potentially important SMPs through chemical modification of the imide substituents. Imide substitutions affect self&#8208;assembly behaviour orthogonally to the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of the perylene core, making for a valuable approach to tune SMP properties. Several recent approaches are therefore highlighted, with a focus on controlling 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208; aggregation, and 3) mechanism of growth and degree of aggregation using thermodynamic and kinetic control. Areas of potential future exploration and application of these functional SMPs are also explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid, highly reactive and stable DOTA&#8208;like tags containing a thiol&#8208;specific phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety for protein modification and NMR analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site specific labeling of paramagnetic NMR tags generate valuable structural restraints such as pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) that can be used to characterize structures, interactions and dynamics of protein&#8208;ligand or nucleic acid complexes. Herein, two single&#8208;armed DOTA&#8208;like tags, BrPSPy&#8208;DO3M(  S  )A&#8208;Ln and BrPSPy&#8208;6M&#8208;DO3M(  S  )A&#8208;Ln, each containing a thiol&#8208;specific reacting group, phenylsulfonyl pyridine moiety, are demonstrated as rigid, reactive and stable paramagnetic tags for protein labeling by formation of a reductive resistant thiol&#8208;ether bond between the protein and the tag. The introduction of Br neighboring the 4&#8208;phenylsulfone group in pyridine enhances the reactivity towards the solvent exposed thiol group in a protein, whereas the methyl group in the sixth position in pyridine increases the rigidity of the tag in the protein conjugates. The high performance and tunable reactivity and rigidity of these two tags can be added in the toolbox of paramagnetic tags suitable for the high&#8208;resolution measurements of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton Coupling in Redox&#8208;Active Salen based Self&#8208;Assembled Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of a redox&#8208;active nickel salen complex into supramolecular structures was explored via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with homobimetallic ruthenium complexes (bridged by oxalato or 5,8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;naphthoquinato ligands). The self&#8208;assembly resulted in the formation of a discrete rectangle using the oxalato complex and either a rectangle or a catenane employing the larger naphthoquinonato complex. The formation of the interlocked self&#8208;assembly was determined to be solvent and concentration dependent. The electronic structure and stability of the oxidized metallacycles was probed using electrochemical experiments, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, confirming ligand radical formation. Exciton coupling of the intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) ligand radical intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) bands provided further confirmation of the geometric and electronic structures in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Surface Curvature in Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive consumption of fossil fuels has caused unavoidable environmental problems. The development of renewable and clean alternatives is essential for the sustainable and green development of human society. Electrocatalysts are most important parts in these energy&#8208;related devices. Recently, scientists found that the surface curvature of electrocatalysts could play an important role for the improvement of catalytic performance and the optimization of intrinsic catalytic activity during electrocatalytic process. The role of surface curvature in electrocatalysts is still under investigating. In this minireview, we summarized the latest progress of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures and their applications in energy&#8208;related applications. This review mainly involves the strategies for preparation of electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures, three typical electrocatalysts with different surface curvatures (curled surface, onion&#8208;like structure, and spiral structure), and the potential mechanisms that surface curvature in electrocatalysts affects activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Dynamic Covalent Architectures by Multivalence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of imine bond is reversible. This feature has been taken advantage of by chemists for accomplishing high yielding self&#8208;assembly. On the other hand, it also jeopardizes the intrinsic stability of these self&#8208;assembled products. However, some recent discoveries demonstrate that some of these imine bond containing molecules could be rather stable or kinetically inert. A deep investigation indicated that such enhanced stability results from, at least partially, multivalence. Such results also inspire chemists to use imine condensation for self&#8208;assembly in water, a solvent that is considered not compatible with imine bond for a long time.</dc:description>

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silica gardens are self&#8208;assembled tubular precipitates formed by a combination of osmosis, buoyancy, and chemical reaction, and thought to be capable of catalyzing prebiotic condensation reactions. In many cases, the tube wall is a bilayer structure with the properties of a diaphragm and/or a membrane. The interest of silica gardens in materials science as microreactors has increased over the past decade because of their ability to create long&#8208;lasting electrochemical potential. In this study, we have grown single macroscopic tubes based on calcium carbonate and monitored their time&#8208;dependent behavior by in&#8208;situ measurements of pH, ionic concentrations inside and outside the tubular membranes, and electrochemical potential differences. Further, we have characterized the composition and structure of the tubular membranes by using ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Based on the collected data, we propose a physicochemical mechanism for the formation and ripening of these peculiar CaCO  3  structures and compare the results to those of other chemical garden systems. We find that the wall of the macroscopic calcium carbonate tubes is a bilayer of texturally distinct but compositionally similar calcite showing high crystallinity. The resulting high density of the material prevents macroscopic calcium carbonate gardens to develop significant electrochemical potential differences. In the light of these observations, possible implications in materials science and prebiotic (geo)chemistry are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonheme Iron Imido Complexes Bearing a Non&#8208;Innocent Ligand: A Synthetic Chameleon Species in Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;imido complexes can perform C&#8211;H activation and sulfimidation reactions, but are far less studied than the more ubiquitous iron&#8208;oxo species. As case studies, we have looked at a recently published iron(V)&#8208;imido ligand &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex, which is formally an iron(VI)&#8208;imido complex [Fe  V  (NTs)(TAML  +&#183;  )] (  1  ; NTs = tosylimido), and an iron(V)&#8208;imido complex [Fe  V  (NTs)(TAML)]  &#8208;  (  2  ). Using a theoretical approach, we found that they have multiple energetically close&#8208;lying electromers, sometimes even without changing spin states, reminiscent of the so&#8208;called Compound I in Cytochrome P450. When studying their reactivity theoretically, it is indeed found that their electronic structures may change to perform efficient oxidations, emulating the multi&#8208;spin state reactivity in Fe  IV  O systems. This is actually in contrast to the known [Fe  V  (O)(TAML)]  &#8208;  species (  3  ), where the reactions occur only on the ground spin state. We also looked into the whole reaction pathway for the C&#8211;H bond activation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene by these intermediates to reproduce the experimentally observed products, including steps that usually attract no interest (neither theoretically nor experimentally) due to their non&#8208;rate&#8208;limiting status and fast reactivity. A new &#8220;clustering non&#8208;rebound mechanism&#8221; is presented for this C&#8211;H activation reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract:  Polyoxothiometalate ions (ThioPOM) are active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts based on modular assembly build from electrophilic clusters {MoS  x  } and vacant polyoxotungstates. Herein, the dumbbell&#8208;like anion [{(PW  11  O  39  )Mo  3  S  4  (H  2  O)  3  (OH)}  2  ]  8&#8208;  exhibits very high light&#8208;driven HER activity while the active cores {Mo  3  S  4  } do not contain any exposed disulfido ligands which were suspected at the origin of the HER activity. Moreover, in the catalyst architecture, the two central {Mo  3  S  4  } cores are sandwiched by two {PW  11  O  39  }  7&#8208;  subunits that act as oxidant resistant protecting groups and behave as electron&#8208;collecting units. A detailed photophysical study was carried out confirming the reductive quenching mechanism of the photosensitizer [Ir(ppy)  2  (dtbbpy)]  +  by the sacrificial donor triethanolamine (TEOA) and highlighting the very high rate constant of the electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the ThioPOM catalyst.

         <title>Remote Radical Desaturation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site&#8208;selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N&#8208;radical generates a translocated C&#8208;radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag&#8208;couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Cyclohexene Oxidation with O2 over Spray&#8208;Flame&#8208;Synthesized La1&#8208;xSrxCoO3 Perovskite Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>La  1&#8208;x  Sr  x  CoO  3  (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) nanoparticles were prepared by spray&#8209;flame synthesis and applied in liquid&#8209;phase oxidation of cyclohexene using molecular O  2  as oxidant under mild conditions. The catalysts were systematically characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques. With increasing Sr content, the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects increases, which is beneficial for cyclohexene oxidation, but the surface concentration of less active Co  2+  was also increased. However, Co  2+  cations have a superior activity towards peroxide decomposition, which also plays an important role in cyclohexene oxidation. A Sr&#8209;doping of 20&#160;at.% was found to be the optimum in terms of activity and product selectivity. It also showed excellent reusability over three catalytic runs, which can be attributed to its highly stable particle size and morphology. Kinetic investigations revealed first&#8209;order reaction kinetics for temperatures between 60 and 100&#160;&#176;C and an apparent activation energy of 68&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8208;1  for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the reaction was not affected by the applied O  2  pressure in the range from 10 to 20 bar.  In situ  attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion of cyclohexene and the formation of reaction products including the key intermediate 2&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;hydroperoxide, while spin trap electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided strong evidence for a radical reaction pathway by identifying the cyclohexenyl alkoxyl radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Synchronicity of Molecular Valence Tautomerism with Macroscopic Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition by Molecular Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of a cobalt&#8208;dioxolene core that exhibits valence tautomerism (VT) with pyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid functionalized with the chains bearing two, four, or six oxyethylene units led to new complexes  Co  n  EGEspy  (  n  = 2, 4, and 6). These complexes commonly form violet crystals of the  low&#8208;spin  (  ls  )&#8208;[Co  III  (  n  EGEspy)  2  (3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)(3,6&#8208;DTBCat)] (  ls  &#8208;[Co  III  ], 3,6&#8208;DTBSQ = 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl semiquinonato, 3,6&#8208;DTBCat = 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl catecholato). Interestingly, violet crystals of  Co2EGEspy  in the  ls  &#8208;[Co  III  ] transitioned into a green liquid, accompanied by an almost complete VT shift (94%) to the  high&#8208;spin  (  hs  )&#8208;[Co  II  (  n  EGEspy)  2  (3,6&#8208;DTBSQ)  2  ] (  hs  &#8208;[Co  II  ]) upon melting. In contrast, violet crystals of  Co4EGEspy  and  Co6EGEspy  in the  ls  &#8208;[Co  III  ] exhibited partial VT (33%) and only a 9.3% VT shift after melting, respectively. These data demonstrate the tunability of the synchronicity of the molecular VT and macroscopic solid&#8208;liquid transitions by optimizing the tethered chains, thus establishing a new strategy for coupling bistable molecules with the macroscopic world.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C 6 H 4 P 2 BPh] 2&#8211; ( 1 2&#8208; ), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C 6 H 4 {PH 2 }) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 1 2&#8208; , which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951; 5 &#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO) 3 (&#951; 5 &#8208; 1 )}{&#956;&#8208;&#951; 1 &#8208;Mo(CO) 3 (TMEDA)} 2 ].[Li(THF)][Li(TMEDA)].</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoS  x  hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45 min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. The results indicated that a fused indoline produced by photochemical intramolecular d&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. Since this substrate has an aminal skeleton, racemization involving a ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing equilibrium process occurred under suitable conditions. Efficient racemization was observed in acetone containing a catalytic base, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). Crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization by Viedma ripening from racemic indoline was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99% ee. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of the indoline was achieved by the photochemical reaction of achiral phthalimide followed by continuous attrition&#8208;enhanced deracemization converging to 99% ee of enantiomeric crystals. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by photochemical hydrogen abstraction and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Study in Red: The Overlooked Role of Azo&#8208;Moieties in Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Strongly Extended Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique optical and photoredox properties of heptazine&#8208;based polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials make them promising semiconductors for driving various productive photocatalytic conversions. However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430&#8208;450 nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting.  Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450 nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high&#8208;temperature (900 &#176;C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de&#8208;ammonification leads to the formation of azo&#8208;groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible&#8208;light (470 nm) for H  2  evolution even without any additional co&#8208;catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge&#8208;trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N &#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99.5% ee ) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers have been extensively studied in recent years. Some of these materials can exhibit several properties such as permanent porosity, high surface area, thermostability and light emission, as well as open sites for chemical functionalization. Concerning the fact that this kind of compounds are usually solids, the size and morphology of the particles are important parameters when an application is desired. Inside this context, there is a subclass of coordination polymers, named Infinite Coordination Polymers (ICPs), which auto&#8208;organize as micro&#8208; or nanoparticles with low crystallinity. Specifically, the particles exhibiting spherical shapes and reduced sizes can be better dispersed, enter cells much easier than bulk crystals and be converted to inorganic materials by topotactic transformation. Luminescent ICPs, in particular, can find applications in several areas, such as sensing probes, light&#8208;emitting devices and bioimaging. In this review, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of ICP&#8208;based spherical particles, including the growth mechanisms, some applications for luminescent ICPs and the challenges to overcome in future commercial usage of these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>From the {FeIII2Ln2} butterfly's perspective: the magnetic benefits and challenges of cooperativity within 3d&#8208;4f based coordination clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this perspective review we discuss the tuning handles which can be used to steer the magnetic properties of FeIII&#8208;4f &#8220;butterfly&#8221; compounds. The majority of presented compounds were produced in the context of project A3 &#8220;Di&#8208; to tetranuclear compounds incorporating highly anisotropic paramagnetic metal ions&#8221; within the SFB/TRR88 &#8220;3MET&#8221;. These contain {FeIII2Ln2} cores encapsulated in ligand shells which are easy to tune in a &#8220;test&#8208;bed&#8221; system. We identify the following advantages and variables in such systems: (i) the complexes are structurally simple usually with one crystallographically independent FeIII and LnIII, respectively. This simplifies theory and anaylsis; (ii) choosing Fe allows 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to be used as an additional technique which can give information about oxidation levels and spin states, local moments at the iron nuclei and spin&#8208;relaxation and, more importantly, about the anisotropy not only of the studied isotope, but also of elements interacting with this isotope; (iii) isostructural analogues with all the available (i.e. not Pm) 4f ions can be synthesised, enabling a systematic survey of the influence of the 4f ion on the electronic structure; (iv) this cluster type is obtained by reacting [FeIII3O(O2CR)6(L)3](X) (X = anion, L = solvent such as H2O, py) with an ethanolamine&#8208;based ligand L&#8217; and lanthanide salts. This allows to study analogues of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(L&#8217;)2(O2CR)6] using the appropriate iron trinuclear starting materials. (v) the organic main ligand can be readily functionalised, facilitating a systematic investigation of the effect of organic substituents on the ligands on the magnetic properties of the complexes. We describe and discuss 34 {MIII2Ln2} (M = Fe or in one case Al) butterfly compounds which have been reported up to 2020. The analysis of these gives perspectives for designing new SMM systems with specific electronic and magnetic signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation of mechanical properties of polymer materials with those of their molecular constituents is the foundation for their holistic comprehension and eventually for improved material designs and syntheses. Over the last decade, optical force probes (OFPs) were developed, shedding light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials. The properties of polymers are diverse, ranging from soft hydrogels to ultra&#8208;tough composites, from purely elastic rubbers to viscous colloidal solutions, and from transparent glasses to super black dyed coatings. Only very recently, researchers started to develop tailored OFP solutions that account for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. We here highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Slow&#8208;Magnetic Relaxation in Pristine Ferrocenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the spin dynamic properties of non&#8208;substituted ferrocenium complexes. Ferrocenium shows a field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in DMF solution while cobaltocene lacks of slow spin relaxation neither in powder nor in solution. Multireference quantum mechanical calculations give a non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation for ferrocenium with small first excitation energy that agrees with the relatively large measured magnetic anisotropy for a transition metal S=1/2 system. The analysis of the spin relaxation shows an important participation of quantum tunnelling, Raman, direct and local&#8208;mode mechanisms which depend on temperature and the external field conditions. The calculation of spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants for the vibrational modes shows that the first vibrational mode, despite having a low spin&#8208;phonon constant, is the most efficient process for the spin relaxation at low temperatures. In such conditions, vibrational modes with higher spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants are not populated. Additionally, the vibrational energy of this first mode is in excellent agreement with the experimental fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode mechanism.</dc:description>

Multireference quantum mechanical calculations give a non-Aufbau orbital occupation for ferrocenium with small first excitation energy that agrees with the relatively large measured magnetic anisotropy for a transition metal S=1/2 system. The analysis of the spin relaxation shows an important participation of quantum tunnelling, Raman, direct and local-mode mechanisms which depend on temperature and the external field conditions. The calculation of spin-phonon coupling constants for the vibrational modes shows that the first vibrational mode, despite having a low spin-phonon constant, is the most efficient process for the spin relaxation at low temperatures. In such conditions, vibrational modes with higher spin-phonon coupling constants are not populated. Additionally, the vibrational energy of this first mode is in excellent agreement with the experimental fitted value obtained from the local-mode mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Glucocerebrosidase Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited deficiencies in &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Current treatments require rapid disease diagnosis and a means of monitoring therapeutic efficacy, both of which may be supported by the use of GBA&#8208;targeting activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). Here, we report the synthesis and structural analysis of a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs for GBA. We demonstrate their covalent mechanism&#8208;based mode of action and uncover binding of the new  N&#8208;  functionalised aziridines to the ligand binding cleft. These inhibitors became scaffolds for the development of ABPs; the O6&#8208;fluorescent tags of which bind in an allosteric site at the dimer interface. Considering GBA&#8217;s preference for O6&#8208; and  N  &#8208;functionalised reagents, we synthesised a bi&#8208;functional aziridine ABP which we hoped would offer a more powerful imaging agent. Whilst this ABP binds to two unique active site clefts of GBA, no further benefit in potency was achieved over our first generation ABPs. Nevertheless, such ABPs should serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to GD and inform the design of future probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reactions of thiophenolates with geminal bis(acceptor)&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in DMSO at 20 &#176;C was monitored by photometric methods. The determined second&#8208;order rate constants of the S  N  2 reactions followed linear relationships with Mayr nucleophilicity parameters (  N  /  s  N  ) and Br&#248;nsted basicities (p  K  aH  ) of the thiophenolates as well as with Hammett substituent parameters (&#963;) for groups attached to the thiophenolates. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted by up to a factor of 15 faster than their unsubstituted analogues, in accord with the known activating effect of adjacent &#960;&#8208;systems in S  N  2 reactions. Variation of electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, inherent S  N  2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;systems because of more advanced C1&#8208;C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, also electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.</dc:description>

In these reactions, two electrons of the nickelole dianion transferred to Ni, representing different reactivity compared with main&#8208;group metallole dianions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The innate immunity TLR4/MD&#8208;2 system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We here combine  ab&#8208;initio  calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies reveal functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular TIR domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)  2  architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Stabilised [SbF4]+: SbF5 as a Fluoride&#8208;Ion Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8211; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8211;N = bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#183;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2. The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;3CH3CN and [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;2SO2 were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations. DFT calculations and NBO analyses reveal that significant degree of electron&#8208;pair donation from N to Sb stabilizes [SbF4]+ with the Sb&#8211;N bond strength being ca. &#160;of that of the Sb&#8211;F bonds in these cations and the cationic charge being primarily ligand&#8208;centred.</dc:description>

DFT calculations and NBO analyses reveal that significant degree of electron-pair donation from N to Sb stabilizes [SbF4]+ with the Sb&#8211;N bond strength being ca. &#160;of that of the Sb&#8211;F bonds in these cations and the cationic charge being primarily ligand-centred.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
