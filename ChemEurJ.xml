         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties show intriguing halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon alternative treatments by trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine, the absorption and the fluorescence can be reversibly switched. It is revealed that the introduced proton is on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring.







Abstract
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110&#8197;nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.

         <title>Organometallic Platinum(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been explored to finely tune the electronic properties of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. The complexes were successfully applied as photosensitisers in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion experiments, demonstrating tuneable upconversion quantum yields of up to 14&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for platinum(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (in which C^N=cyclometalating ligand; acac=acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2)&#8197;&#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm (&#1013; &#8776;5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and orange red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em=603&#8211;620&#8197;nm; &#934;em &#8804;37&#8201;%), which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed by microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57&#8201;%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&#934;UC 5.9&#8211;14.1&#8201;%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.

         <title>Homogeneous Dearomative Hydrogenation with a Co/P4N2 Catalyst: A Nucleophilic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes in a nucleophilic manner. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arenes.







Abstract
Arene hydrogenation is the most straightforward method to prepare carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. However, the high resonance energy prevents aromatic substrates from hydrogenation. Herein the homogeneous, nucleophilic hydrogenation of less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes is reported. The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to the cyano (hetero)arene substrates. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the catalytically active CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arene substrates. An outlook for the synthesis of more challenging substituted benzenes was proposed based on the in&#8197;silico modification of the CoH species.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Mediated Regioselective Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization via an Aryl BF2 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes N&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes has been achieved. The reaction proceeds via a BBr3 promoted 5 and 6&#8208;membered boracycle that undergoes a ligand exchange promoted by Selectfluor to give a previously scarce aryl BF2 species. The aryl BF2 is a bench stable intermediate that can be used for the deborylative functionalization of the 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes scaffold.







Abstract
An efficient regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes via an azaaryl BF2 complex has been developed. Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF2 in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds Bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic tuning of ground&#8208;state structures for tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species has been achieved by changing electronic properties of the equatorial aryl groups on the central carbon, confirmed by a correlation between Hammett para&#8208;substituent constant and solid&#8208;state structures of a series of cationic species based on a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7 tricyclic framework.







Abstract
To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton with sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of para substituents (R=Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe) of the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R=H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208; and methyl&#8208;derivatives were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the p&#8208;MeO and thioxanthenyl system were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8722;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These findings amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence of the hypervalent apical 3c&#8211;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electronic tuning of ground-state structures&lt;/b&gt; for tetra- and penta-coordinate carbon species has been achieved by changing electronic properties of the equatorial aryl groups on the central carbon, confirmed by a correlation between Hammett &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituent constant and solid-state structures of a series of cationic species based on a 7-6-7 tricyclic framework.

         <title>Probing the Importance of Host Symmetry on Carbohydrate Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple switch from formic acid to HFIP allows the formation of the C3 symmetrical hemicryptophane cage analogue of the previously reported C1 symmetrical one. The cage with low symmetry exhibits higher binding constants towards carbohydrates than the C3 analogue. The receptors showed remarkable high substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity towards &#945;&#8208;glucoside and &#946;&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
The design of molecular cages with low symmetry could allow for more specific tuning of their properties and better mimic the unsymmetrical and complex environment of protein pockets. However, the added value of lowering symmetry of molecular receptors has been rarely demonstrated. Herein, C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;symmetrical cages, presenting the same recognition sites, have been synthesized and investigated as hosts for carbohydrate recognition. Structurally related derivatives of glucose, galactose and mannose were found to have greater affinity to the receptor with the lowest symmetry than to their C3&#8208;symmetrical analogue. According to the host cavity modelling, the C1 symmetry receptor exhibits a wider opening than its C3&#8208;symmetrical counterpart, providing easier access and thus promoting guest proximity to binding sites. Moreover, our results show the high stereo&#8208; and substrate selectivity of the C1 symmetry cage with respect to its C3 counterpart in the recognition of sugars.

         <dc:description>We present a system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400 &#8211; 450 nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480 &#8211; 550 nm) part of the visible spectrum. Together they form a pair, which allows to selectively photoactivate the one or the other in oligonucleotides. We propose a numerical characterization defining the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; and show how chromatically selective uncaging can literally be titrated in a kinetic reaction scheme.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8211;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Magnetization Blocking Energy of Biradical&#8208;Metal System by Merging Discrete Complexes into One&#8208;Dimensional Chains</title>

All five complexes contain a biradical&#8208;Ln unit in which the biradical chelates the LnIII ion by the means of one aminoxyl (i.e. NO) group of each NIT unit. For the discrete complexes, a Cu(hfac)2 links two biradical&#8208;Ln units via one of the remaining NO groups, while for the chain compounds, the two remaining NO groups of the biradical&#8208;Ln moiety are each coordinated to a Cu(hfac)2 unit to form a 1D coordination polymer. Moreover, in the chains a terminal Cu(hfac)2 unit is coordinated to imidazole&#8208;N atom of the NITPhMeImbis ligand. Spin dynamics investigations evidenced the onset of slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2, whereas 4 and 5 exhibit a typical single&#8208;chain magnet behavior. This highlights the vital role of the 1D spin correlation in the blocking of the magnetization. These results illustrate that from the same basic building blocks, magnetic relaxation can be carefully modulated by structural adjustments.</dc:description>

         <title>Guided Isolation of An Uncommon Cembranoid Orthoester, Sarcotortin A, and Three Skeletal Diverse Terpenoids from the Hainan Soft Coral Sarcophyton tortuosum Based on Molecular Networking Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3&#8722;6 and 9&#8722;13 were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06 &#956;M. In addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45 &#956;M, respectively. Compound 9 showed interesting&#160;cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA&#8208;MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93 &#956;M, respectively.</dc:description>

In addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45 &#956;M, respectively. Compound 9 showed interesting&#160;cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA-MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93 &#956;M, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Regioisomeric Alternating Borane&#8208;Terthiophene Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>Main&#8208;chain boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are attractive for organic electronic, sensing, and imaging applications. Alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers were prepared and the effects of regioisomeric attachment of the conjugated linker and variations in the electronic effect of the pendent aryl groups (2,4,6&#8208;tritert&#8208;butylphenyl, Mes*; 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, FMes) examined. Pd2dba3/P(t&#8208;Bu)3&#8208;catalyzed Stille polymerization of arylbis(2&#8208;thienyl)borane and arylbis(3&#8208;thienylborane) with 2,5&#8208;bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene at 120 &#186;C gave polymers with appreciable molecular weight but MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses showed evidence of unusually prominent homocoupling. These defects could be suppressed by using brominated rather than iodinated monomers, more hindered 2,5&#8208;bis(tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylstannyl)thiophene as comonomer, and Pd2dba3/P(o&#8208;tol)3 as the catalyst at 100 &#186;C. Under these conditions, macrocyclic species with n = 3 &#8211; 10 repeating units formed preferentially according to MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses. Photophysical studies revealed a prominent effect of the regiochemistry and the nature of the pendent aryl groups on the absorption and emission, giving rise to orange, yellow&#8208;green, blue&#8208;green, and blue emissive materials respectively. The electronic effects were rationalized through DFT calculations on bis(terthiophene) model systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a B&#8208;Antigen Hexasaccharide, a B&#8208;Lewis b Heptasaccharide and Glycoconjugates Thereof to Investigate Binding Properties of Helicobacter pylori</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infecting the stomach of almost 50% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions between bacterial membrane&#8208;bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin (BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. Herein, we report the synthesis of a B&#8208;antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof to assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B&#8208;determinant or vice versa. The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B&#8208;determinant in the Bleb7&#8208;conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6&#8208;conjugate.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl2(TMP)] (TMP = 2,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (2) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8208;C bond activation, leading to a doubly&#8208;fused C10BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron&#8208;bound allylamino ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2 with CuX (X = Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing 2 under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of 2 with chalcogens led, in the case of N2O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8210;CCAAC bond and formation of the 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC&#8208;chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8210;Se multiple bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing peptidylprolyl bond&#160;cis/trans&#160;status using distal&#160;19F NMR reporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for measuring peptidylprolyl bond cis&#8208;trans conformational status in peptide models is described, using 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine (4FPhe) as a distal reporter for 19F NMR. The %cis&#8208;Pro population was measured for peptides of the general structure Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe (X and Z are proteinogenic amino acids) at pH 7.4, and provided conformational populations consistent with literature values obtained by more complex methods. This approach was applied to probe the prolyl bond status in pentapeptide models of the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal region of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which mirrored the preferences in the Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe models. Advantageously, the 19F reporter group does not need to be adjacent to or attached to proline to provide quantifiable signals and distal 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanines can be placed so as not to influence prolyl bond conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that the prolyl bond status is not significantly affected by pH when there are ionisable amino acid residues at the carboxyl side of proline, which makes 19F NMR an invaluable tool with which to study proline isomerism at a range of pHs and in different solvents and buffers.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover Induced by Changing the Identity of the Secondary Metal Ion from PdII&#173; to NiII in a Face&#8208;Centered FeII8MII6 Cubic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrete spin crossover (SCO) heteronuclear cages are a rare class of material which have potential use in next&#8208;generation molecular transport and catalysis. Previous investigations of cubic cage [Fe8Pd6L8]28+ constructed using semi&#8208;rigid metalloligands, found that Fe(II) centers of the cage did not undergo spin transition. In this work, substitution of the secondary metal center at the face of the cage resulted in SCO behavior, evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, M&#246;ssbauer and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Structural comparisons of these two cages shed light on the possible interplay of inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions associated with SCO in the Ni(II) analogue, 1. The distorted octahedral coordination environment, as well as the occupation of the CH3CN in the Ni(II) axial positions of 1, prevented close packing of cages observed in the Pd(II) analogue. This led to offset, distant packing arrangements whereby important areas within the cage underwent dramatic structural changes with the exhibition of SCO.</dc:description>

         <title>L&#8208;Serine is the Direct Precursor for the Pyrazine Ring Construction in the Biosynthesis of 3&#8209;Isobutyl&#8209;2&#8209;Methoxypyrazine in Bell Pepper Fruits (Capsicum annuum L.)</title>

         <dc:description>3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is an extremely potent odorant and responsible for the specific aroma of many fruits and vegetables. Especially bell pepper contains high levels of IBMP, which is the character impact compound of its typical aroma. However, since the discovery of methoxypyrazines in plants in the 1960s the biosynthesis of their pyrazine ring motif remained so far unknown. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP was investigated by feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. For the first time it could be shown that l&#8208;serine plays a key role in the pyrazine ring construction of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs). Based on HS&#8208;SPME&#8208;GCxGC&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analysis, it is shown that the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP is closely linked to photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermoresponse of Odd&#8208;Even Effect in n&#8208;Alkanethiolate Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on Gold Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper examines thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n&#8208;alkanethiolates (SCn, n = 3 &#8211; 18) formed on template&#8208;stripped gold (AuTS) using macro&#8208; and microscopic analytical techniques, contact angle goniometry (CAG) and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, respectively. Both CAG and VSFG analyses showed that the odd&#8208;even effect in liquid&#8208;like SAMs (n = 3 &#8211; 9) disappeared upon heating at 50 &#8211; 70 &#176;C, indicating that the heating led to increased structural disorder regardless of odd and even carbon numbers. In contrast, the opposite thermoresponse was observed for odd and even SCn molecules in wax&#8208; and solid&#8208;like SAMs (n = 10 &#8211; 18). Namely, temperature&#8208;dependent orientational change of terminal CH3 relative to the surface normal was opposite for the odd and even molecules, thereby leading to mitigated odd&#8208;even effect. Our work offers important insights into thermoresponse of supramolecular structure in condensed organic matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenative Borylation of Ketones and Aldehydes with Bis(Catecholato)Diborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanisms of direct deoxygenative borylation of acetone and benzaldehyde with bis(catecholato)diborane (B2cat2) in the solvent DMA (N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide) are investigated through detailed density functional theory calculations. Our calculations show that the isomer 1,2&#8208;B2cat2in situ generated from 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 induced by DMA is the reactive boron intermediate for the reactions. The addition of the B&#8208;B bond of 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 to the C=O bond of acetone or benzaldehyde via a concerted [2&#963;+2&#960;]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;like transition state is the rate&#8208;limiting step for both the triboration reaction of acetone and the monoboration reaction of benzaldehyde. DMA not only acts as the solvent but also promotes the structural isomerization of B2cat2, the deoxygenation of acetone to form the vinyl boronate intermediate and subsequent diboration of vinyl boronate with 1,2&#8208;B2cat2, as well as the protodeboronation of the gem&#8208;diboronate intermediate in the deoxygenative borylation of benzaldehyde. Our computational results can explain the observed experimental facts and provide insight into the roles of the isomeric 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and the solvent DMA in related reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Search of Hosts for Blue OLEDs:&#160;Computational Design and Experimental Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the difficulties associated with the traditional &#8216;trial and error&#8217; approach for a complete analysis of a giant molecular space, we took the aid of computational pathway (DFT) in screening a large space search of 780 (12&#215;13&#215;5) molecules to search for a host for the blue emitter. The selection process was completed in three Tiers with the conditions of highest theoretical triplet energy (&gt;2.81 eV), aligned HOMO/LUMO levels w.r.t blue dopant (FIrpic), and position of substituents to meet the optimal requirements as host materials. &#160;Tier 1 screened twelve different imidazole heterocycle derivatives as base space groups which resulted in the selection of 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole. Tier 2 process converged the search to mCN&#8208;CZ having the highest triplet energy and appropriate HOMO/LUMO level relative to FIrpic and ETL. Further, the carbazole of mCN&#8208;CZ was replaced with different aromatic hydrocarbons to find the other best compound in terms of triplet energy and HOMO/LUMO. Tier 3 resulted in another promising candidate (mCN&#8208;FL) as possible host materials. The band alignment with guest predicted mCN&#8208;FL and mCN&#8208;CZ to have optimal device performances compared to CZ&#8208;CZ and the experimentally observed device performance was in accordance with virtual screening results when TAPC was utilized as the hole transporter. The device results of mCN&#8208;CZ and mCN&#8208;FL were better than the reference host TCTA. &#160;The obtained results thus proved that a virtual screening process will be a useful tool for synthetic chemists in designing task&#8208;specific materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Emissive D&#8208;D&#8208;A Carbazole Luminophores: Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanofluorochromism, Aggregation&#8208;Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission, and Photodynamic Therapy Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of multi&#8208;functionalized luminophores with full&#8208;color emission based on an identical core skeleton is a significative but challenging research topic. In this work, eight donor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;D&#8208;A) type luminogens based on a central carbazole core bearing a hydrocarbon chain of six carbon atoms are designed by using different kinds of donor and acceptor units on the left and on the right and synthesized in good yields. These D&#8208;D&#8208;A carbazole derivatives display deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, blue&#8208;green, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, orange and red fluorescence in the solid state, respectively, achieving full&#8208;color emission covering the whole visible light range under UV light illumination. Notably, dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;containing carbazole derivative exhibits rare aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission and red to near&#8208;infrared mechanofluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100 nm. Furthermore, red emissive luminogen can serve as a potential candidate for cell imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The present work not only provides reference for the construction of full&#8208;color emissive systems but also opens a new avenue to the preparation of multi&#8208;functionalized luminophores capable of simultaneously applying in near&#8208;Infrared mechanical&#8208;force sensors and PDT fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Aliphatic C&#8208;H Methylation of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct and selective C&#8208;H methylation is a powerful tool with which to install methyl groups into organic molecules, and is particularly useful in pharmaceutical chemistry. However, practical methods for such modification of biologically interesting targets have been rarely developed. We here report an iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;H methylation reaction of glycine derivatives, peptides and drug&#8208;like molecules in an alcohol in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide. A readily available iron catalyst plays multiple roles in the transformation, which accelerates oxidation of C&#8208;N bonds to C=N double bonds, activates imine intermediates as Lewis acids by bidentate chelation, and at the same time facilitates cleavage of the peroxide to generate methyl radicals. A variety of methylated N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives and peptides were obtained in good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity. This reaction is scalable, easily managed, and can be completed within 1&#8722;2 h. It features an economic, bio&#8208;friendly catalyst, a green solvent and low toxic reagents, and will provide effective access to precise C&#8208;H modification of biomolecules and nature products.</dc:description>

         <title>5&#8208;(Trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium Triflate: Introducing the 1,1,2&#8208;Trifluoroethylene Tether in Drug&#8208;Like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript reports the synthesis and structure of an unprecedented sulfonium salt, 5&#8208;(trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium triflate, and its use as a versatile reagent for the introduction of the bioisosteric 1,1,2&#8208;trifluoroethylene linker in drug&#8208;like structures. The protocol developed consists of the reaction of this compound with alcohols and phenols to deliver a complete set of 1,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(alkoxy&#8208;/aryloxy)ethyl sulfonium salts, which have been purified by column chromatography and fully characterized. Subsequent single electron reduction under mild photochemical conditions efficiently affords the corresponding fluoroalkyl radicals that are trapped either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly through their reaction with (hetero)arenes. Theoretical calculations are used to evaluate the conformational consequences derived from the presence of the CF2&#8208;CHF tether.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transparent dark orange Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#183;4H2O was synthesized by reaction of Ba(N3)2 and AuCl3 or HAuCl4 in aqueous solution. The novel barium tetraazidoaurate(III) tetrahydrate crystallizes in the monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9) with a = 1813.68(17) pm, b = 1737.95(11) pm, c = 682.04(8) pm and &#946; = 108.849(4)&#176;. Predominant structural features of Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#183;4H2O are two crystallographically independent discrete anions [Au(N3)4]&#8211; with gold in a tetragonal planar coordination by nitrogen. Vibrational spectra show good agreement with other azidoaurates(III). Upon drying, this salt was shown to be a highly explosive material.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;metal cooperativity is emerging as an important strategy in catalysis. This requires appropriate ligand scaffolds that can support two metals in close proximity. Here we report nickel&#8208;promoted formation of a dinucleating planar macrocyclic ligand that can support bimetallic dinickel(II) and dinickel(I) complexes. Reaction outcomes can be tuned by variation of the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or conventional pincer architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type and spinel&#8208;type NaxMnO2 (NMO) are reviewed. High&#8208;capacity NMOs and strategies to improve capacity are introduced and discussed in detail. The future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.







Abstract
Sodium manganese&#8208;based oxides (NMO) are attracting huge attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). To date, one of the most important challenges of NMO&#8208;based cathodes is the relatively low capacity. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Great efforts have been made to enhance the reversible capacity of NMO&#8208;based cathodes, achieving considerable progress not only on electrochemical performance, but also the mechanism of massive sodium ion storage. In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of NMO are reviewed, including P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type, and spinel&#8208;type NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Strategies for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes, such as cationic substitution, anion redox activation, etc are introduced in detail. Last but not least, the future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;Linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ganging up on bacteria: Siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for the activation of an antibacterial prodrug within cells. A fluoroquinolone prodrug was developed and shown to be compatible with the catalysts under micro&#8208;aerobic, biologically relevant conditions. The co&#8208;addition of the catalysts and prodrug to E.&#8197;coli showed a combinative effect, with the dihydroxybenzoic acid&#8208; and azotochelin&#8208;linked catalysts showing most promise for cellular uptake and thus intracellular prodrug activation.







Abstract
Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules called siderophores that are released by bacteria to acquire iron have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised, and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whereas a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines. By employing complementary bacterial growth assays, conjugates containing siderophore units based on catechol and azotochelin were found to be most promising for intracellular prodrug activation.

         <title>Stabilization of Potent Co(II)&#8208;based Lewis Acids with Weakly Basic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tame, but not too much. Complexation of Co(II) with weakly Lewis&#8208;basic ligands yields complexes with calculated Fluoride Ion Affinity in CH2Cl2 solution comparable to SbF5 &#8208; a benchmark for Lewis superacidity. Stabilization with weakly coordinating anion {Al[OC(CF3)3]4}&#8722; allows isolation of such complexes in the form of easily storable salts and their thorough characterization.







Abstract
Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis&#8208;acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)&#8208;WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO2, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis&#8208;acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF5 according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.

Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Luminescent Vanadium(II) Complexes with Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Quantum Coherence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards qubits with optical read&#8208;out: Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (4MLCT) states account for the color of the vanadium(II) complex isomers cis&#8208;fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[V(ddpd)2]2+ in spite of the electron&#8208;rich pyridines. 2MLCT states mix with the lowest spin&#8208;flip states, contracting the V&#8722;N bonds in the excited state and preventing ruby&#8208;like spin&#8208;flip emission. Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K.The mer isomer shows slow magnetic relaxation in an external magnetic field. These results pave the way for qubits with optical read&#8208;out based on vanadium(II) complexes.







Abstract
Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35&#8197;GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400&#8197;mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling through Nitrogen Deletion: Application to Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductive amination&#8208;&#8220;nitrogen deletion&#8221; reaction sequence employing (hetero)aromatic aldehydes and (het)arylmethyl amines as the building blocks, and anomeric amide as the reagent was implemented for the parallel synthesis of compound libraries. The method gave access to a chemical space of over half a million compounds relevant to early drug&#8208;discovery initiatives.







Abstract
A protocol for parallel C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes and (hetero)arylmethyl amines based on a reductive amination &#8211; &#8220;nitrogen deletion&#8221; reaction sequence has been developed. After preliminary validation experiments, an illustrative compound library of 25&#8197;members was prepared with 76&#8201;% synthetic efficiency. The estimated chemical space accessible by the proposed approach covers almost 600&#8201;000&#8197;representatives that are scarcely represented in current compound databases.

         <title>Coupling Value&#8208;Added Anodic Reactions with Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction is a promising strategy to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals. In this review, recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential anodic reactions are summarized. Current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are also proposed.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction features a promising approach to realize carbon neutrality. However, its competitiveness is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which consumes a large portion of energy. Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction has been emerging as a promising strategy in recent years to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals at both cathode and anode of the electrolyzer. This review briefly summarizes recent progresses on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the economic feasibility of different CO2 electrolysis systems is discussed. Then a comprehensive summary of recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential value&#8208;added anodic reactions is provided, with special focus on the specific cell designs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are proposed, which are targeted to facilitate progress in this field and push the CO2 electrolyzers to a more practical level.

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand design has a strong impact on the surface activity of organometallic complexes. Complementing the ligand system of a Pt complex with fluorinated groups triggers strong enrichment at the IL/vacuum interface in IL solution in a buoy&#8208;like fashion, which was studied by ARXPS.







Abstract
The targeted enrichment of a Pt complex with an ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;derived ligand system in IL solution is demonstrated by using angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When the ligand system is complemented with fluorinated side chains, the complex accumulates strongly at the IL/gas interface, while in an equivalent solution of a complex without these substituents no such effect could be observed. This buoy&#8208;like behavior induces strong population of the complex at the outermost molecular layer close to surface saturation, which was studied over a range from 5 to 30&#8201;%mol. The surface enrichment was found to be most efficient at the lowest concentration, which is particularly favorable for catalytic applications such as supported ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;phase (SILP) catalysis.

         <title>Azatriseptanes &#8208; strained framework analogs of [7,7,7]circulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses and characterizations of heptagon&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds are essential for understanding the effect of negative curvature on carbon allotropes such as fullerene and graphene that have applications in functional organic materials. However, owing to the synthetic difficulties in functionalizing and embedding 7&#8208;membered rings, these strain&#8208;challenged structures are relatively unexplored. We report here the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a triarylamine core bridged with ethane chains at the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;positions. In doing so, we provide access to the first heterocycle containing three fused heptagon rings with a nitrogen at its core (BATA&#8208;NHAc). DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography reveal a remarkably strained structure wherein two of the bridged aryl units approach coplanarity, whilst the third ring is twisted out of plane. The unique conformation of BATA&#8208;NHAc results in distinctive photophysical and electrochemical properties that open new avenues in understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships of curved &#960;&#8208;aromatics and the construction of &#960;&#8208;frameworks of increasing complexion.</dc:description>

In doing so, we provide access to the first heterocycle containing three fused heptagon rings with a nitrogen at its core (BATA-NHAc). DFT calculations and X-ray crystallography reveal a remarkably strained structure wherein two of the bridged aryl units approach coplanarity, whilst the third ring is twisted out of plane. The unique conformation of BATA-NHAc results in distinctive photophysical and electrochemical properties that open new avenues in understanding the structure-property relationships of curved &#960;-aromatics and the construction of &#960;-frameworks of increasing complexion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Rubottom&#8208;type Oxidation Catalyzed by Chiral Calcium Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient catalytic asymmetric Rubottom&#8208;type oxidation is described. Using meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) as the oxidant and chiral calcium phosphate as the catalyst, the facile transformation enables direct hydroxylation of N&#8208;Boc oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters in high yields (up to 99%) and in a highly enantioenriched fashion (up to &gt;99% ee). The application of the established method has been demonstrated by the synthesis of a pharmaceutically important 3&#8208;hydroxyoxindole with excellent enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Mini&#8208;PEGs Modification on the Enzymatic Digestion of D&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Containing Peptides under the Action of PROK**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We previously reported that D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides exhibited the ability to resist enzymatic hydrolysis. This study investigated the influence of mini&#8208;PEGs modification on enzymatic hydrolysis ability of D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides. The results showed that PEGylation promoted enzymatic hydrolysis of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide, especially, the cleavage rate of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide 6&#8208;w with PEG3 modification at the N&#8208;ends was up to 17 times in the presence of Proteinase K comparing with those without PEG3 modification. Moreover, analysis of the enzymatic cleavage sites demonstrated a similar cleavage pattern of the PEGylated D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide to that of the unmodified peptide. The computational simulations further showed the enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis ability&#160;can be&#160;attributed to the strong interaction between PROK and the peptide after PEG3 modification and the resulting formation of a mature catalytic triad structure.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Release of Secondary Amine Bases for the Activation of Catalysts and Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent (DCv) ureas have been used abundantly to design self&#8208;healing materials. We demonstrate that apart from self&#8208;healing materials, the species present in the equilibrium of DCv ureas can be employed as responsive organocatalysts. Easily controllable stimuli like heat or addition of water shift the equilibrium towards isocyanate and free base which can function as an in situ released reagent. We demonstrate this application of DCv ureas with two examples. Firstly, we use the liberated base to catalytically activate a latent organocatalyst for acylhydrazone formation. Secondly, this base can be employed in an equimolar manner to trigger the release of nitrile&#8208;N&#8208;oxides from chlorooximes, which react with acrylates to form an isoxazoline polymer gel.</dc:description>

         <title>AuNP&#8208;Modulated qPCR: An Optimized System for Detecting MIR Biophotons Released in DNA Replication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life systems can utilize energy with a high efficiency. Biophotons were proposed to modulate biological functions with such efficiency, however the underlying mechanism remains unexplored, especially due to the challenge in ultraweak mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) light detection and the theoretical perturbation from spontaneous MIR emission. Here, we proposed an optimized system to detect MIR biophotons generated in the hydrolysis of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP, an energy&#8208;storing molecule similar to ATP). The system used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) that was modulated by gold nanoparticle (AuNP) concentration and thus by the inter&#8208;AuNP distance which depends on the concentration above. The measurements indicate that 33&#8208;THz and 84&#8208;THz photons are released by dNTP hydrolyses, which can drive DNA replication. Our findings provide a chain reaction&#8208;based novel method for detecting MIR photons in solution, and a pave way for photon&#8208;based insights to understand the high&#8208;efficiency energy utilization of biology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dibenzo[b,g]phosphindolizine oxide and three types of benzo[e]naphthophosphindolizine oxides were synthesized by the ring&#8208;closing metathesis of benzo[b]phosphole oxide and naphthophosphole oxides with two olefin tethers, respectively. Their molecular structures and properties were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis. The number and position of benzene rings were found to alter the structural geometry and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and their effects were investigated by theoretical calculations.

         <title>New Strategy for Optimizing the Properties of Copper Halide Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Lighting&#8208;emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported, which can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures with coordinated anionic coordinated modules, combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to prepare high&#8208;performance copper(I) halide hybrid luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper(I) halide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials have many advantages, such as diverse structure, facile synthesis, high luminescent efficiency, tunable optical performance, etc., and show a broad application prospect in energy&#8208;saving lighting, display and other fields. However, compared with commercial rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based phosphors, the reported hybrids generally suffer from poor stability and low luminescent efficiency, which are the bottleneck problem of their practical application. With the aim of developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported. This strategy can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures by combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to optimizing their properties. This design method is expected to develop high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, promote the in&#8208;depth understanding of this field, and provide new ideas for the optimization of other types of hybrid materials.

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8722;H Insertion Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Computational analysis revealed iodonium ylides to possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing potentials, situated along the extensions of their C&#8722;I bonds. Experimentation revealed that formal O&#8722;H or S&#8722;H insertion reactions were possible with carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols. Halogen&#8208;bond activation is presumed to be essential, resulting in &#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls in 64&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield in five minutes.







Abstract
The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, with the more electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8722;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8722;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8208;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Symmetrical BODIPYs via Fischer Carbene Complexes: Theoretical, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole polyfunctionalized core is obtained from Fischer alkynyl carbenes and oxazolones and used to obtain highly functionalized symmetric BODIPYs with modulating optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
A series of new symmetrical highly substituted BODIPYs 6&#8201;a&#8211;l was synthesized through a prefunctionalization approach in 35&#8201;%&#8211;89&#8201;% yields from the pyrrole core. This strategy allowed modulation of the substituents at the different positions based on the choice of Fischer's alkynyl carbenes, oxazolones and aldehydes used as precursors. The substituent variation at positions 2, 6, 3 and 5 had the greatest effect on the modulation of their photophysical properties such as absorption (&#955;abs) and emission (&#955;em) wavelengths, extinction coefficient (&#1013;), quantum yields (&#981;), Stokes shifts (&#916;&#957;), fluorescence decay, radiative (krad) and non&#8208;radiative (knr) constants and the CIE 1931 coordinates. Theoretical calculations allowed to corroborate the effect of the substituents of meso&#8208;position on the modification of the dihedral angles. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the BODIPY series presents similar redox potential behavior, being electrochemically active even in successive cycles, which suggests that transport by diffusion is the dominant process.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Readout of the Mechanical Response of a Bis&#8208;acridinium [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemochromic and electrochemical properties of a switchable bis&#8208;acridinium [2]rotaxane led to two different mechanical responses and an ON/OFF reading of the motion in the assembly. This work could lead to the use of the acridinium core as a recognition unit for radical templating through &#960;&#8208;mer formation.







Abstract
A [2]rotaxane built around a multi&#8208;responsive bis&#8208;acridinium macrocycle has been synthesized. Structural investigation has confirmed the interlocked nature of the molecule, and MD simulations illuminated its conformational dynamics with atomic resolution. Both halochromic and redox&#8208;switching properties were explored to shed light on the mechanical response and electronic changes that occur in the bis&#8208;acridinium [2]rotaxane. The topology of the rotaxane led to different mechanical behaviors upon addition of hydroxide ions or reduction that were easily detected by UV/Vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry.

         <title>Acridone&#8208;Based Host Materials for Green Phosphorescent and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent OLEDs with Low&#8208;Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining carbazole and acridone units through pyridyl bridge, a bipolar host with highly twisted and rigid structure is developed, which guarantees the green phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs to exhibit remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
By linking the carbazole unit to the nitrogen atom of acridone through phenyl or pyridyl, two compounds, named 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz) and 10&#8208;(5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz) were designed and synthesized. These two materials, characterized with highly twisted and rigid structure, good thermal stability, and balanced carrier&#8208;transporting properties, were employed as host materials for green phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The carbazole group, despite its small contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these two materials, plays an essential role as an intramolecular host in energy delivering and improving the hole transporting ability of these two hosts. The incorporation of the electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl group as a linking group slightly improves the electron transporting capability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz. The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V, a maximum power efficiency and an external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext) of 89.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and 25.2&#8201;%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge&#8208;balancing ability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz host due to the presence of the pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness due to the suppressed non&#8208;radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, the AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz&#8208;hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 1.6&#8201;% from the maximum next at a high brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a roll&#8208;off of 15.9&#8201;% at an extremely high brightness of 10000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study manifests that acridone&#8208;based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, nucleophilic substitution and elimination cascade reaction allows the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. Ionic liquids are suitable recyclable solvents for the reaction. This synthetic strategy opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes.

The engagement in tandem of well&#8208;known organic reactions such as the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions, enables the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. This retrosynthetic approach opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes. Furthermore, ionic liquids are suitable solvents to perform the cascade reaction and recycle the metal catalysts.

         <title>Studies towards the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Dictyoxetane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone is used to prepare a key building block for the total synthesis of the marine natural product dictyoxetane in enantiopure form. A synthetic alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annelation is developed, and the reactivity and diastereoselectivity of the resulting tetrasubstituted chiral furan in cycloaddition reactions towards an appropriately functionalised carbocyclic core of dictyoxetane are explored.







Abstract
The dolabellane&#8208;type diterpene dictyoxetane represents a significant challenge to synthetic organic chemistry. Methodology directed towards the total synthesis of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;dictyoxetane is reported. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of the trans&#8208;hydrindane ring system is achieved through chemoselective deoxygenation of the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone. An alternative to the Garst&#8208;Spencer furan annulation is developed for the synthesis of a 2,5&#8208;dimethyl, tetrasubstituted furan, employing a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig alcohol to alkyne cyclisation/aromatisation reaction as a key step. The (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of an oxyallyl cation with a tetrasubstituted furan is established on a cyclohexanone&#8208;derived model system, and a range of related (4+3) cycloadditions investigated on a homochiral, trans&#8208;hydrindane&#8208;fused furan, where regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity is required for the natural product synthesis. In an alternative (4+2) Diels&#8208;Alder approach, a C2&#8208;symmetric vinyl sulfoxide&#8208;based chiral ketene equivalent is used to prepare oxanorbornenes with the same oxygen bridge stereochemistry found in the 2,7&#8208;dioxatricyclo[4.2.1.03,8]nonane ring system of the natural product.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Divergent Lithiation of 2,3&#8208;Dihalopyridines: Deprotolithiation versus Halogen Dance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The divergent lithiation of 2,3&#8208;dihalopyridines is reported. Taking advantage of continuous&#8208;flow technology, either the deprotolithiation or the halogen dance is carried out. After subsequent trapping with various electrophiles, 25 examples of both regioisomers were obtained in excellent yields and selectivities. Finally, this methodology was scaled up and a promising space&#8208;time yield was obtained.







Abstract
We describe herein the first halogen dance (HD) in continuous flow on 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine by selectively trapping a (pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)lithium species that is known to undergo the halogen&#8208;dance process. In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process was extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines by using various electrophiles to afford 28 examples with yields ranging from 42 to 97&#8201;% with very short residence times. Finally, scale up of the reaction was demonstrated, affording a promising space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 4.2&#8197;kg.h&#8722;1.L&#8722;1.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes: Strong Emitters for Molecular Polaritonics</title>

Polaritonics with Peri Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes. Functionalization with electron donating groups leads to a class of highly fluorescent dyes, containing a tetraazaperylene core, which are excellent materials in strong light&#8208;matter coupling in resonant optical microcavities. This new class of functional dyes, whose properties can be simply tuned, showed fascinating behavior in molecular polaritonics.







Abstract
The functionalization of the peri position of the bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the peri position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80&#8201;%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.

C&#8722;C cleavage to arylation. Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple aliphatic ketones has been achieved via chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage involving &#946;&#8208;diketones and para&#8208;quinone monoimines that facilitates the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of simple ketones has been achieved by chiral primary amine catalyzed asymmetric retro&#8208;Claisen cleavage of &#946;&#8208;diketones. This mild organocatalytic strategy enables the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl tertiary carbon stereocenters in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee) with the para&#8208;quinone monoimines as aryl sources. Furthermore, oxidative catalytic asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation has also been realized with free p&#8208;aminophenols.

The enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features the use of a 1,3&#8208;dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a thirty&#8208;carbon meroterpenoid capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity along with the novel molecular architecture, this plant metabolite has remained a popular synthetic target. Herein we report a full account of our synthetic investigations that have led to the enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A, establishing its absolute stereostructure. The protecting group&#8208;free, twelve&#8208;step synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode.

         <title>Binding of Glycans to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein, an Open Question: NMR Data on Binding Site Localization, Affinity, and Selectivity</title>

Sweet, but not so sweet. The SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein engages in weak interactions with sialoglycans, but binding to ABO(H) blood group antigens cannot be confirmed by STD NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbation experiments show that none of the glycans interacts with the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein.







Abstract
We have used NMR experiments to explore the binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein (S&#8208;protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm the binding of sialoglycans to the S&#8208;protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S&#8208;protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S&#8208;protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916;143&#8211;145 of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein, thus supporting localization of the binding site in the N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8208;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8208;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using 1H,15N TROSY HSQC&#8208;based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, we excluded binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan&#8208;binding to the S&#8208;protein.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term, Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging of Proteins in Live Cells with Photoregulated Fluxional Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational tuning of molecular properties delivered fluxional fluorophores that blink spontaneously upon photoisomerization. The compatibility of these probes with the self&#8208;labeling protein HaloTag enabled single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific molecular targets in live cells for exceptionally long periods of time.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can reveal nanometric details of biological samples, but its high phototoxicity hampers long&#8208;term imaging in live specimens. A significant part of this phototoxicity stems from repeated irradiations that are necessary for controlled switching of fluorophores to maintain the sparse labeling of the sample. Lower phototoxicity can be obtained using fluorophores that blink spontaneously, but controlling the density of single&#8208;molecule emitters is challenging. We recently developed photoregulated fluxional fluorophores (PFFs) that combine the benefits of spontaneously blinking dyes with photocontrol of emitter density. These dyes, however, were limited to imaging acidic organelles in live cells. Herein, we report a systematic study of PFFs that culminates in probes that are functional at physiological pH and operate at longer wavelengths than their predecessors. Moreover, these probes are compatible with HaloTag labeling, thus enabling timelapse, single&#8208;molecule imaging of specific protein targets for exceptionally long times.

         <title>Fused Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo): Broad&#8208;Range Wavelength&#8208;Independent Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives are introduced as unique photoswitches with wavelength&#8208;independent isomeric ratios in photostationary states. The wavelength&#8208;independent photoswitching, high bistability and significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum make bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives interesting candidates for MOST applications.







Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We disclosed that the Z&#8208;E photoisomerization of the meta&#8208;bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength&#8208;independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Ring&#8208;Opening Rearrangement of Cyclopropenes Enabled by Dichotomous Gold&#8722;Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two in One: A gold&#8208;catalyzed divergent ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes has been developed for concise synthesis of structurally important polysubstituted naphthols and furans enabled by the dichotomous gold&#8722;carbenes. The use of different gold&#8208;catalysts allows for successful tuning of gold carbene reactivity or gold carbenoid reactivity in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes affords an efficient route to either polysubstituted naphthols or aryl&#8208;substituted furans. Owing to the unique dichotomy of gold&#8722;carbenes, this protocol provides a switchable reaction selectivity between naphthols and furans enabled by the use of TFP&#8722;Au(MeCN)SbF6 (tri(2&#8208;furyl) phosphine) or PNP(AuNTf2)2 (bis(diphenylphosphino)(isopropyl) amine) as catalysts respectively. It is proposed that the gold&#8722;carbene intermediate might be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;naphthol rearrangement while the gold&#8208;carbocation is more likely to be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;furan rearrangement.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Functionalities of Temporally Controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene conjugate acts as a conventional 1O2 sensor, a unique spatiotemporally controlled 1O2 sensor, or a good photosensitizer depending on the photoexcitation wavelengths. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that the unique multifunctionality was achieved by the unique photoexcited states of the molecule. The molecular ability in living cells was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (RA) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i) RA acts as a conventional fluorogenic 1O2 sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with 1O2. (ii) RA acts as a temporally controlled 1O2 sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (&#8764;700&#8197;nm) photosensitization. RA enters an intermediate state after capturing 1O2 and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii) RA acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate 1O2 under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and RA shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in RA offer to promise molecular tools to apply 1O2 in a spatiotemporal manner.

         <title>Influence of Achiral Phosphine Ligands on a Synergistic Organo&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the employment of synergistic amino&#8208; and palladium catalysis, an allylic alkylation is disclosed where all four stereoisomers can be accessed as the major product. Importantly, this stereodivergence has been developed to employ the aminocatalyst as the sole chiral reagent. While the aminocatalyst dictates the enantioselectivity, diastereoselectivity is governed by the nature of an achiral, monodentate phosphine ligand on palladium.







Abstract
An unusual diastereodivergent stereoselective allylation reaction is presented. It consists of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of an organocatalytically generated amino isobenzofulvene, where the diastereoselectivity is controlled by the electronic properties of a monodentate, achiral ligand on palladium. One major diastereoisomer is formed using triarylphosphines substituted with neutral or electron&#8208;donating substituents of the aryl group, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents favor the other diastereoisomer. The diastereoselectivity correlates with the Taft inductive parameter of substituents on the triarylphosphine ligand on palladium. The synergistic reaction involves both a catalytic secondary amine catalyst for the indene&#8208;aldehyde activation and the monodentate phosphine ligands on palladium, affording a highly enantioselective reaction with up to 98&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Based on computational investigations, the role of the monodentate phosphine ligand on the diastereoselectivity is discussed.

         <title>The Core/Shell Structure P Doped MoS2@Ni3S2 Nanorods Array for High Current Density Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline and Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array with core/shell structure was prepared through successive sulfuration and phosphorization strategies, which exhibits close catalytic activity to Pt/C, the overpotential is only 290&#8197;mV at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis is the most promising strategy to generate clean energy H2, and the development of catalysts with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance at high current density that can resist strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte environment is of great significance for practical industrial application. Therefore, a P doped MoS2@Ni3S2 nanorods array (named P&#8208;NiMoS) was successfully synthesized through successive sulfuration and phosphorization. P&#8208;NiMoS presents a core/shell structure with a heterojunction between MoS2 (shell) and Ni3S2 (core). Furthermore, the doping of P modulates the electronic structure of the P&#8208;NiMoS; the electrons transfer from the t2g orbital of Ni element to the eg empty orbital of Mo element through the Ni&#8722;S&#8722;Mo bond at the Ni3S2 and MoS2 heterojunction, facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, P&#8208;NiMoS exhibits excellent HER activity; the overpotential is 290&#8197;mV at high current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte, which is close to Pt/C (282&#8197;mV@250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and P&#8208;NiMoS can stably evolve hydrogen for 48&#8197;h.

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Unprotected C&#8208;Acyl Manno&#8208;, Rhamno&#8208; and Lyxopyranosides</title>

Just a pinch of copper iodide promotes the reaction of manno&#8208;type glycosyl iodides with lithiated dithianes. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of unprotected manno&#8208;type C&#8208;acyl pyranosides. The crucial role of the catalyst was proven by mechanistic studies and DFT calculations, suggesting a copper&#8208;radical mechanism over a SN&#8208;type mechanism.







Abstract
Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis C&#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for C&#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected C&#8208;acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the C&#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;, l&#8208;rhamno&#8208; and d&#8208;lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies. Furthermore, the C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;glycosides were easily isomerized to give rapid access to their &#946;&#8208;anomers.

         <title>Alkyne Activation in the Diversity Oriented Synthesis of sp2&#8208;Rich Scaffolds: A Biased Library Approach for Targeting Polynucleotides (DNA/RNA)</title>

         <dc:description>
The targeting of polynucleotide (RNA and DNA) topologies and their protein complexes by small molecules has enormous potential in the discovery of new therapeutics across a broad range of diseases (infectious, chronic and congenital). Polynucleotides are very different structures to proteins and have a much greater capacity to form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitably &#960;&#8208;rich small molecules. To exploit this difference, we have developed a diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis approach to &#960;&#8208;rich scaffolds from a common set of substrates. The utility of this approach has been exemplified in the discovery of a novel topoisomerase&#8208;1 inhibitor.







Abstract
Polynucleotides, DNA and RNA (mRNA and non&#8208;coding RNAs) are critically involved in the molecular pathways of disease. Small molecule binding interactions with polynucleotides can modify functional polynucleotide topologies and/or their interactions with proteins. Current approaches to library design (lead&#8208;like or fragment&#8208;like libraries) are based on protein&#8208;ligand interactions and often include careful consideration of the 3&#8208;dimensional orientation of binding motifs and exclude &#960;&#8208;rich compounds (polyfused aromatics) to avoid off&#8208;target R/DNA interactions. In contrast to proteins, where &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions are weak, polynucleotides can form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitable &#960;&#8208;rich ligands. To assist in designing a polynucleotide&#8208;biased library, a scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis approach to polyfused aromatic scaffolds has been undertaken. Initial screening hits that form moderately stable polynucleotide&#8208;ligand&#8208;protein ternary complexes can be further optimized through judicious incorporation of substituents on the scaffold to increase protein&#8208;ligand interactions. An example of this approach is given for topoisomerase&#8208;1 (TOP1), generating a novel TOP1 inhibitory chemotype.

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supply Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 71, December 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe was synthesized with varied Fe amount to construct a piezo&#8208;Fenton system driven by ultrasound, achieving the coupling of piezoelectric processes and Fenton reactions without exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Electrons generated in the piezoelectric process takes part in hydrogen peroxide production and accelerate the Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle. The piezo&#8208;Fenton system exhibited excellent and stable hydroxyl radical generating capacity in pH&#8197;2&#8211;9 without iron leaking, and the hydroxyl radicals mainly contributed to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process.







Abstract
The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8722;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4 matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;min&#8722;1. Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0&#8764;9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.

         <title>Two 3D Rubidium Halide Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectrics Templated by Quasi&#8208;Spherical Organic Amine 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane</title>

Two 3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid ABX3 perovskite structures constructed with [RbX6] (X=Br, I) octahedra by sharing corner or face can accommodate the large spherical organic molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane using the different cavities in their inorganic frameworks.







Abstract
The emergence of (CH3NH3)PbI3 has brought the development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) structures with ABX3 type to a higher level; however, most 3D frameworks are constructed by corner&#8208;sharing of BX6 octahedra. Herein, we substituted the spherical molecule 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2.2.2&#8208;dabco) with 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;dabcn) as a template to react with RbX (X=Br, I) in the corresponding HX acids under the consideration of reducing the molecular symmetry. Two 3D OIHP compounds [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbI3&#8901;H2O (1) and [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]RbBr3 (2) crystallized in non&#8208;centrosymmetric point group mm2 before the phase transition point were isolated. Among them, the 3D inorganic framework of 1 is constructed by sharing the corner of [RbI6] octahedra, while that of 2 is constructed by sharing the corner and face of [RbBr6] octahedra to acquire large cavities to accommodate the organic amine cation [1,4&#8208;3.2.2&#8208;H2dabcn]2+; this 3D framework type is unprecedented in the OIHPs. As expected, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit reversible phase transition, dielectric and second harmonic generation (SHG) and ferroelectric properties, in which the phase transition temperature of 2 at 374&#8197;K is much higher than compound 1 at 280&#8197;K.

Two orthogonal stimuli, namely electrons and hydroxide ions, were used to probe the mechanical response in a bis&#8208;acridinium rotaxane. Like the yin&#8208;yang representing two opposite but complementary forces, both stimuli trigger opposite mechanical behavior and provide complementary readouts. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Heitz, H.&#8208;P. Jacquot&#8197;de&#8197;Rouville and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202840).

DNA and RNA molecules are capable of a wide range of functions. Here I provide an overview of how nucleic acids with interesting and useful properties can be identified and optimized using artificial evolution. I also describe motifs that push the limits of DNA and RNA function in various ways. These examples highlight the remarkable functional potential of nucleic acids.







Abstract
For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.

Abstract
Supramolecular vesicles (SMVs) self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of two scaffolds linked together through noncovalent interactions, can realize stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release of encapsulated drugs for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized side effect of drugs. Pillararenes (PAs), an emerging kind of macrocyclic hosts in 2008, are easy to modify with a variety of functionalities. SMVs from PAs and specific guests mainly based on the host&#8211;guest interactions have attracted increasing attention because of their drug delivery and controlled drug release. A great progress in the construction and stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery of the PA&#8208;based SMVs has been made since the first work was reported in 2012. This review summarizes the major achievements of the PA&#8208;based SMVs for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery over the past 5&#8197;years, including the microstructures of SMVs, multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive SMVs, prodrug SMVs from prodrug PAs and guests, bola&#8208;type SMVs, multifunctional SMVs, glucose&#8208;responsive SMVs for insulin delivery, novel SMVs from responsive PAs, thermo&#8208;responsive SMVs, and ternary SMVs, for chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and other biological applications. The future challenges and research directions of PA&#8208;based SMVs are also outlined from the points of views of the fundamental research, biological applications, and clinical applications of PA&#8208;based SMVs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation recently became an important reaction to planarize &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and oligomers. However, the high&#8208;activation barrier to cleave the C&#8208;H bond often requires high&#8208;temperature annealing, consequently restricting structures of precursor molecules and/or leading to random fusion at their edges. Here, we present a synthesis of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomers from 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane molecules on Ag(111) with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy. This non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization between pyrazine and ethynylene/cumulene groups has a low&#8208;activation barrier, with forming intermediary dimeric oligomer containing dipyrazinopyrrolopyrrolopyrazine units, thus giving new insight into the strain&#8208;sensitive in ladder&#8208;oligomer formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective arylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. Remarkably, the regioselectivity in the cyclization of conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes can be controlled by a choice of the phosphine ligand, with triphenylphosphine and tricyclohexylphosphine leading to the exclusive formation of 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol and 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol derivatives, respectively.







Abstract
Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, that is, the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination (&#8220;anti&#8208;Wacker&#8221;&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.

         <title>Influence of Pore Size in Benzoin Condensation of Furfural Using Heterogenized Benzimidazole Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzimidazole exhibited divergent stability when covalently anchored on mesoporous and hierarchical supports in the benzoin condensation of furfural. The highest stability was achieved with 150&#8197;&#197; Davisil silica in DMF. Silica supports with smaller mesopores hindered benzimidazole stability due to van der Waals interactions with silica walls, resulting in poor recyclability of the hybrid organocatalysts.







Abstract
A designed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst was covalently anchored on a range of mesoporous and hierarchical supports, to study the influence of pore size in the benzoin condensation of furfural. The structural and spectroscopic characteristics of the anchored catalysts were investigated, also with the help of molecular dynamics simulations, in order to rationalize the degree of stability and recyclability of the heterogenized organocatalysts. Quantitative yields (99&#8201;%) and complete recyclability were maintained after several cycles, vindicating the design rationale.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Carbene Transfer to Isocyanides as a Platform for Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The readily available low&#8208;valent iron complex [Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722; catalyzes the efficient transfer of carbenes to isocyanides. The resulting ketenimines undergo in&#8197;situ cyclocondensation with various bisnucleophiles to give a broad range of medicinally relevant heterocycles. A plausible mechanism for the carbene transfer is proposed based on DFT calculations.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalysed carbene transfer reaction of diazo compounds to isocyanides has been developed. The resulting ketenimines are trapped in&#8197;situ with various bisnucleophiles to access a range of densely functionalized heterocycles (pyrimidinones, dihydropyrazolones, 1H&#8208;tetrazoles) in a one&#8208;pot process. The electron&#8208;rich Hieber anion ([Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722;) facilitates efficient catalytic carbene transfer from acceptor&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds to isocyanides, providing a cost&#8208;efficient and benign alternative to similar noble metal&#8208;catalysed processes. Based on DFT calculations a plausible reaction mechanism for activation of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl carbene precursor and ketenimine formation is provided.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Hosts for Polysulfides Conversion and Lithium Plating/Stripping towards Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Full Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios and several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and the severe dendritic growth in the lithium anode. Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios. Firstly, this review briefly describes the stubborn issues in Li&#8722;S battery operations and the sophisticated counter measurements over the challenges by dual&#8208;functional behaviors. Then, the latest advances on dual&#8208;functional hosts for both cathode and anode in Li&#8722;S full cells are catalogued as species, including metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, heterostuctures, and the possible mechanisms during the process. Besides, we also outlined the theoretical calculation tools for the dual&#8208;functional host based on the first principles. Finally, several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Framework&#8208;Decorated Leaf&#8208;like 2D Nanosheets as Flexible Air Cathode for Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic self&#8208;supporting electrode with 3D structure was synthesized. The electrode was composed of Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC) on a carbon cloth. The dual&#8208;metal CuCo sites provide efficient ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity by the synergistic effect, thus reducing the energetic barrier.







Abstract
Exploring highly active and robust self&#8208;supporting air electrodes is the key for flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries (FZABs). Therefore, we report a novel 3D structural bimetal&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrode consisting of hybrid Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets on carbon cloth (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC), which displays excellent electrochemical activity and durability of the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.863&#8197;V toward ORR and an overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward OER, owing to its exposed bimetallic sites accelerating the kinetic reaction. In addition, the density functional theory calculation proves that the synergistic effect of CuCo sites favors ORR and OER. Hence, the FZABs based on Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC achieve a larger open&#8208;circuit potential (1.45&#8197;V), higher energy density (130.10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and outstanding cycling stability. All remarkable results demonstrate valuable enlightenment for seeking advanced energy materials of portable and wearable electronics.

         <title>Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) donors to capture anions. Here the nature and selectivity of confined H&#8208;bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block&#8208;localized wavefunction method (BLW&#8208;ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the inward H&#8208;bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH H&#8208;bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction respectively. Cryptands are classified into two groups, including the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers with the captured halides located near the centroids of cages, and the &#8220;semi&#8208;open&#8221; conformers with shifting bonding sites for halides. Accordingly, the selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the C3 NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the C3(h) CH cryptands as the size of anion increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halides. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion. Unlike C3 conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi&#8208;open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi&#8208;open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner H&#8208;bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate fundamental biochemistry. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated reaction that enables the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, we demonstrate the installation of a range of moieties into model systems and successfully integrate an effective PTM&#8208;mimic into a recombinantly expressed histone.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Phototheranostics based on Carbon Nanohorns for Precise Imaging&#8208;Guided Post&#8208;PDT toward Residual Tumor Cells after Initial Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the multi&#8208;stimulus response to exogenous laser and endogenous hyaluronidase, the HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs inhibited the growth of residual tumor cells after photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) through activatable imaging&#8208;guided PDT. This work provides a rational strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for the programmable design of multiple stimulus responses in precision medicine.







Abstract
As promising photonic material, phototheranostics can be activated in the laser irradiation range of tumor with sensitivity and spatiotemporal precision. However, it is difficult to completely eradicate solid tumors due to their irregularity and limited laser irradiation area. Herein, multi&#8208;stimulus responsive HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs were constructed with single&#8208;walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) modified hyaluronic acid (HA) via non&#8208;covalent binding. This SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics not only exhibited water dispersion but also could target tumor and be activated by near&#8208;infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs could be degraded by hyaluronidase in residual tumor cells, causing HA&#8722;Ce6 to fall off the SWNHs surfaces to restore autofluorescence, thus precisely guiding the programmed photodynamic treatments for residual tumor cells after the initial phototherapy. Thus, this work provides a rationally designed multiple&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for precise PDT/PTT and post&#8208;treatment imaging&#8208;guided PDT of residual tumor cells.

         <title>Probing a General Strategy to Break the C&#8722;C Bond of Benzene by a Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the benzene ring by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion could become favourable both kinetically and thermodynamically via a general strategy by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, demonstrated by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
The oxidative addition of C&#8722;C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons by low valent main group species has attracted considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental chemists due to the big challenge in breaking their aromaticity. Herein, a general strategy to break the C&#8722;C bonds in benzene by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion is demonstrated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results suggest that the activation of the C&#8722;C bond of benzene by this anion is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable whereas introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups makes such C&#8722;C bond activation becomes favorable both kinetically and thermodynamically. Such a sharp change on the kinetics and thermodynamics could be rationalized by the frontier molecular orbital theory by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the mono&#8208; and disubstituted benzenes. Aromaticity is found to stabilize the transition state for the ring open step. All these findings can help develop the chemistry of small&#8208;molecule activation.

Variations in reactivity are observed for the geminal Si&#8722;O&#8722;P and Al&#8722;O&#8722;P Frustrated Lewis Pairs tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Al(CH(SiMe3)2)2 towards CO2, nitriles and alkynes regarding regioselectivity, structure and stability of the corresponding adducts.







Abstract
The new oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (2) is able to reversibly bind carbon dioxide at ambient temperature. We compared its reactivity towards benzil, but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one, nitriles and phenylacetylene to that of the Al/P FLP tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=&#8722;CH(SiMe3)2) (1). When reacted with benzil, both, 1 and 2, form the 1,2&#8208;addition product, but in the Si/P FLP 2, the second carbonyl function additionally binds to the silicon atom. With but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one 2 forms the 1,2&#8208;addition product, while 1 binds in 1,4&#8208;position. The reaction with acetonitrile yielded an unexpected etheneimine adduct for both systems, while only 1 reacted with tert&#8208;butylnitrile. With benzonitrile and acrylonitrile, 2 showed reversible addition to the C&#8801;N bond and 1 forms a stable adduct with benzonitrile. Solely 1 shows reactivity towards phenylacetylene affording a mixture of the CH deprotonation adduct tBu2P(H)&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2(CCPh) and the FLP &#8722;C&#8801;C 1,2&#8208;addition adduct under ring formation. All compounds were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, XRD and elemental analysis.

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenicity of Tetrazine&#8208;Modified Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and bright! The inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the synthetic tetrazine&#8208;modified dyes with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA follow the new concept of the two&#8208;factor fluorescence fluorogenicity which improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed. The labelling reactions proceed also extremely fast.







Abstract
Two green fluorescent tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. With DNA as target biopolymer the fluorescence of these dyes is released by two factors: (i) sterically by their interaction with DNA, and (ii) structurally via the conjugated tetrazine as quencher moiety. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to &#8805;284,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 560 by the two&#8208;factor fluorogenicity. These dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with BCN&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The two&#8208;factor fluorescence release improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed, which is a great advantage for live cell imaging of DNA and RNA in the future.

         <title>Erythrose and Threose: Carbonyl Migrations, Epimerizations, Aldol, and Oxidative Fragmentation Reactions under Plausible Prebiotic Conditions</title>

Prebiotic sugars: An investigation of carbonyl migration and epimerization, proceeding down the entire carbon chain of tetrose sugars (d&#8208;erythrose and d&#8208;threose) in aqueous media, and ultimately leading to a mixture of d&#8208;erythrulose, rac&#8208;erythrulose and rac&#8208;tetroses arising from the above reactions, is presented in this study.







Abstract
The prebiotic generation of sugars in the context of origins of life studies is of considerable interest. Among the important intramolecular processes of sugars are carbonyl migrations and accompanying epimerizations. Herein we describe the carbonyl migration&#8208;epimerization process occurring down the entire carbon chain of chirally pure d&#8208;tetroses sugars under mild conditions. Employing chirally pure 1&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose, 4&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose and 1&#8208;13C&#8208;threose, we (1) identify all the species formed as the carbonyl migrates down the four&#8208;carbon chain and (2) assess the rates associated with the production of each of these species. Competing aldol reactions and oxidative fragmentation processes were also observed. Further observations of self&#8208;condensation of glycolaldehyde mainly yielding 2&#8208;keto&#8208;hexoses (sorbose and tagatose) and tetrulose also provides a basis for understanding the effect of carbonyl migrations on the product distribution in plausible prebiotic scenarios.

         <title>Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive PhotochromismChromism of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Bisflavin Based on the Aggregation and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisflavin 1&#8201;a exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsive chromism: The fluorescent color of 1&#8201;a can be controlled upon variation of concentration, temperature, solvent, and additives based on the specific aggregation and redox properties arising from highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform. The utility is demonstrated by multi&#8208;colored drawing with 1&#8201;a inks with various concentrations.







Abstract
Multistimuli&#8208;responsive chromism was observed for vinylene&#8208;linked bisflavin 1&#8201;a with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform. The yellow emission of a dilute solution of 1&#8201;a in CHCl3 (0.2&#8197;mM) observed at 298&#8197;K under UV excitation was changed to orange or red emission upon (1) an increase of concentration, (2) a decrease of temperature, and (3) variation of the solvent. This is in contrast to the almost non stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism of the N&#8208;methylated bisflavin analogue 1&#8201;b and monoflavin 2&#8201;a. Mechanistic investigation by 1H NMR analysis under various conditions revealed that the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation platform and imide moiety of 1&#8201;a generate controllability in the formation of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;ordered aggregates, which induce variation of the emission color upon change. Bisflavin 1&#8201;a also exhibited redox&#8208;induced chromism, where the orange emission of 1&#8201;a was quenched by the addition of hydrazine under anaerobic conditions, and changed back to the original emission upon subsequent bubbling of O2 gas.

         <title>Complexation Preferences of Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Adaptive Gene Vectors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic constitutional frameworks: 40 different amphiphilic dynamic constitutional frameworks were prepared in a stepwise covalent self&#8208;assembly process and their DNA complexation preferences revealed marked differences, not only as a function of the number and type of cationic headgroups, but also as a function of the type of DNA, yielding distinct polyplex architectures.







Abstract
The growing applications of therapeutic nucleic acids requires the concomitant development of vectors that are optimized to complex one type of nucleic acid, forming nanoparticles suitable for further trafficking and delivery. While fine&#8208;tuning a vector by molecular engineering to obtain a particular nanoscale organization at the nanoparticle level can be a challenging endeavor, we turned the situation around and instead screened the complexation preferences of dynamic constitutional frameworks toward different types of DNAs.

Herein, we designed and synthesized 40 new DCFs that vary in hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, number of cationic headgroups. The results of DNA complexation obtained through gel electrophoresis and fluorescent displacement assays reveal binding preferences of different DCFs toward different DNAs. The formation of compact spherical architectures with an optimal diameter of 100&#8211;200&#8197;nm suggests that condensation into nanoparticles is more effective for longer PEG chains and PEI groups that induce a better binding performance in the presence of DNA targets.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic constitutional frameworks&lt;/b&gt;: 40 different amphiphilic dynamic constitutional frameworks were prepared in a stepwise covalent self-assembly process and their DNA complexation preferences revealed marked differences, not only as a function of the number and type of cationic headgroups, but also as a function of the type of DNA, yielding distinct polyplex architectures.

         <title>Trace explosive detection based on photonic crystal amplified fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With increasing demand from public security and environmental protection, it is highly desirable to develop strategies to identify trace explosives (e.g., 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT)). Herein, we report novel photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based sensor chips for trace TNT detection by using amplification effect of PCs on fluorescence (FL) signals. The sensor chips are constructed by integrating silica nanoparticles (NPs) modified with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer (FITC) and PC substrates. The amino groups on FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs can specifically bind with TNT molecules to form Meisenheimer complexes and strongly quench FL signal of neighboring fluorophores FITC through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. PCs with matched PBG can amplify FL signal of FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs about 24.4&#8208;fold and significantly improve sensitivity and resolution of trace TNT detection with the limit of detection of 0.23 nM. The PC&#8208;based sensor chips are stable, sensitive, and reliable TNT sensing platforms, showing great potential in homeland safety and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of a novel bis&#8208;stannylene pincer ligand and the complexation toward coinage metals (CuI, AgI and AuI) have been described. All coinage metal centres are in tetrahedral coordination environments in the solid state and are exclusively coordinated by four neutral SnII donors. 119Sn NMR provided information about the behavior in solution. All of the isolated compounds feature photoluminescent (PL) properties which were investigated at low and elevated temperatures. Compared to the free bis&#8208;stannylene ligand, coordination to coinage metals has led to an increase in the luminescence intensity. Detailed investigations of the new compounds by all&#8208;electron relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In cellulo site&#8208;specific unnatural amino acid incorporation based on amber stop codon reassignment is a powerful tool to modify protein at defined positions. This technique is herein applied to the selective functionalization of the Pneumococcal surface adhesin A protein at three distinct positions. N&#949;&#8208;propargyloxycarbonyl&#8208;l&#8208;lysine residues were incorporated and their alkyne groups reacted using click&#8208;chemistry with a synthetic azido&#8208;functionalized tetrasaccharide representative of one repeat unit of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide. Anti&#8208;PsaA antibody response induced in mice by the trivalent glycoconjugate was determined in comparison with corresponding monovalent and randomly functionalized conjugates. Our results suggest that controlled was superior to random conjugation for preserving antigenicity. In definitive, the reported strategy offers a unique opportunity to study the impact of carbohydrate antigen&#8208;carrier protein connectivity on immunogenicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8211;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitivity and specificity are both crucial for the efficient solid&#8208;state NMR structure determination of large biomolecules. We present an approach which features both advantages by site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8211;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This approach utilizes modern biochemical techniques for sparse isotope labeling and exploits molecular dynamics of 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups exclusively present in the protein. These dynamics drive heteronuclear cross relaxation and thus allow for specific hyperpolarization transfer across the biomolecular complex&#8217;s interface. On the example of the L7Ae protein in complex with a 26mer guide RNA minimal construct from the box C/D complex in archaea, we demonstrate that a single methyl&#8211;nucleotide contact is responsible for the majority of polarization transfer to the RNA, and that this specific transfer can be used to boost both NMR spectral sensitivity and specificity by DNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the collaborative effect at the Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;MoS2 hybrid interface for electrochemical melatonin determination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8211;guest interactions are of paramount importance in supramolecular chemistry and in a wide range of applications. In particular, it is known the ability of Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) to selectively host small molecules. We show that the charge transfer and complexation capabilities of CB[n] are retained on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), allowing the development of efficient electrochemical sensing platforms. We unveil the mechanisms of host&#8211;guest recognition between the MoS2&#8208;CB[8] hybrid interface and Melatonin (MLT), an important molecular regulator of vital constants in vertebrates. We show that CB[8] on MoS2 organizes the receptor portals perpendicular to the surface, facilitating MLT complexation. This advantageous adsorption geometry is specific to TMDs and favours MLT electro&#8208;oxidation, as opposed to other 2D platforms like graphene, where one receptor portal is closed. This study rationalises the cooperative interaction in 2D hybrid systems to improve the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical sensing platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination and stabilization of a lithium ion with a silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the stabilization of lithium&#8208;ion as the source of lithium to use as a trans&#8208;metalation reagent [{PhC(NtBu)2Si(tBu)Li}2I(tBuN)2CPh] (1). The reaction of 3 equivalents of the LSitBu (L = PhC(NtBu)2) and lithium iodide at low temperature leads to a silylene stabilized lithium&#8208;ion with an additional coordination of amidinate ligand. Compound 1 shows two four membered and one six membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Whereas the reaction of the LSiCl with 1.5 equivalents of carbodiimide (CyN)2C at room temperature affords compound [PhC(NtBu)2Si(Cl)&#173;(NCy)2NCy] (2) with the CN2SiN2C skeleton containing silicon as a central atom. Both the compounds were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and quantum mechanical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization Triggered by Iminium&#8722;Enamine Activation: Access to Complex Cyclohepta[b]indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The expeditious construction of complex molecules having multiple stereocenters is highly desirable in organic chemistry.&#160; In the present communication, we report the development of an organocatalytic asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones via the C3&#8208;selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles triggered by LUMO&#8208;lowering iminium activation/HOMO&#8208;raising enamine activation. The reaction provides access to bicyclic enones, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation from C2&#8208;position to afford highly strained cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocenters and three new C&#8208;C bonds in excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;Hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated Radical Cyclization and Total Synthesis of Kamebanin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ent&#8208;kaurenes consist of an ABC&#8208;ring based on a trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrene skeleton and a D ring with an exomethylene. Highly oxygen&#8208;functionalized ent&#8208;kauren&#8208;15&#8208;ones have promising antiinflammatory pharmacological activity. In this study, we developed a novel diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via a Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization. We also demonstrated the applicability of this method by developing the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;kamebanin (longest linear sequence; 17 steps, overall yield; 6.5%). Furthermore, this synthesis provided a formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement for the construction of the quaternary carbon at C8 and a novel Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler type reaction for the construction of the D ring.</dc:description>

         <title>An efficient, site&#8208;selective and spontaneous peptide macrocyclisation during in vitro translation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclisation provides a means of stabilising the conformation of peptides, often resulting in improved stability, selectivity, affinity, and cell permeability. In this work we report a new approach to peptide macrocyclisation using a cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;containing amino acid that we show can be incorporated into peptides by both in vitro translation and solid phase peptide synthesis, meaning it should be applicable to peptide discovery by mRNA display. This cyclisation proceeds rapidly, with minimal by&#8208;products, is selective over other amino acids including non N&#8208;terminal cysteines, and is compatible with further peptide elaboration exploiting such an additional cysteine in bicyclisation and derivatisation reactions. Using molecular dynamics simulation we show that the new cyclisation group is likely to influence the peptide conformation as compared to previous thioether&#8208;based approaches, through rigidity and intramolecular aromatic interactions, illustrating their complementarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. It is of great importance to accelerate the activation of O2 to generate highly active oxygen species, such as hydroxyl peroxide and hydroxyl species to improve catalytic performance for selective oxidation of methane. Selective oxidation of methane using O2 by coupling in&#8208;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide via tandem catalysis ensures the easy formation of active oxygen species for methane activation, leading to high oxygenates productivity under mild conditions. In this concept, we summarized the recent progresses for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using O2 based on tandem catalysis by coupling with in&#8208;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide. The remaining challenges and future perspectives for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates via tandem catalysis were also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Organic Radicals Participation in Charge Transfer: A New Strategy toward Molecular Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer (CT) engineering with inter&#8208;/intramolecular CT interactions by simple compositions has emerged as a universal and efficient way to construct organic functional materials. Stable organic radicals with unique physicochemical properties that cannot be realized in closed&#8208;shell molecules, have been widely demonstrated to be ideal building blocks to construct versatile organic CT materials. In this concept article, we provide a brief overview of the advances in the design, structure and property of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT molecular functional materials, and the strategy for the generation of these materials is also highlighted. We firstly introduce radicals as open&#8208;shell donors or acceptors, and focus on their importance and uniqueness in improving electrical, magnetic and optical properties of CT functional materials. Additionally, CT interactions in stable radical dimers and trimers are further discussed systematically. Finally, we summarize the challenges and provide several perspectives for future development of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective and Chemoselective Phosphine oxide&#8208;catalyzed Aldol Reaction of&#160;N&#8208;Unprotected Cyclic Carboxyimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic transformations of&#160;N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides&#160;such as succinimides, hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, and glitazones,&#160;is a powerful way of directly accessing variety of biologically valuable chiral compounds. Herein, a bis(trichlorosilyl) nucleophilic intermediate formed from cyclic carboxyimides was reacted with aldehydes via (S)&#8208;SEGPHOS dioxide (SEGPHOSO), proceeding&#160;the&#160;aldol reaction in highly enantioselective fashion through a cyclic transition state. Furthermore,&#160;N&#8208;unprotected carboxyimides were chemoselectively activated, even in the presence of&#160;N&#8208;alkylated carboxyimides, to undergo stereoselective and chemoselective aldol reactions via&#160;in situ&#160;silicon tetrachloride activation. The functionalized cyclic carboxyimides is readily derived to the several synthetic units derivatization to various chiral building blocks without&#160;unnecessary protection/deprotection steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis, Absolute Configuration, and Phytotoxic Activity of Foeniculoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. In this study, the first total synthesis, absolute configuration, and phytotoxic activity are described. Foeniculoxin and hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.







Abstract
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and an advanced Mosher's method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A.&#8197;thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.

         <title>Terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O Units in Organometallic Frames</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Landscape beyond the oxo&#8208;wall. The terminal auronitrene and auroxyl species [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; are identified as local minima by calculation and experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) in the gas phase. These open&#8208;shell species defy the standard rules to assign oxidation states since the unpaired electrons are located on the terminal monoatomic ligand (N and O) rather than on the metal.







Abstract
Since gold is located well beyond the oxo wall, chemical species with terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O units are extremely rare and limited to low coordination numbers. We report here that these unusual units can be trapped within a suitable organometallic frame. Thus, the terminal auronitrene and auroxyl derivatives [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; were identified as local minima by calculation. These open&#8208;shell, high&#8208;energy ions were experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2): They respectively arise by N2 or NO2 dissociation from the corresponding precursor species [(CF3)3Au(N3)]&#8722; and [(CF3)3Au(ONO2)]&#8722; in the gas phase. Together with the known fluoride derivative [(CF3)3AuF]&#8722;, they form an interesting series of isoleptic and alloelectronic complexes of the highly acidic organogold(iii) moiety (CF3)3Au with singly charged anions X&#8722; of the most electronegative elements (X=F, O, N). Ligand&#8208;field inversion in all these [(CF3)3AuX]&#8722; species results in the localization of unpaired electrons at the N and O atoms.

         <title>Electrophile&#8208;Promoted Nucleophilic Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylindoles to Give 4&#8208;Substituted Oxazinoindolones</title>

Synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolone derivatives by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed. This protocol was applied to a series of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles containing different substituents. The reaction conditions also tolerated a variety of diorganyl diselenides having both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. However, the reaction did not work for diorganyl disulfides and ditellurides. The reaction mechanism seems to proceed via an ionic pathway and the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides is crucial for successful cyclization. We also found that using the same starting materials, by simply changing the electrophilic source to iodine, led to the formation of 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;oxazinoindolones. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8722;Se and Csp2&#8722;I bonds were tested under cross&#8208;coupling conditions leading to the preparation of a new class of functionalized indole derivatives. In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.

         <title>Bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium: Si&#8722;H Hydride Abstraction and Phosphorus&#8208;Ligand Cooperative Activation of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first donor&#8208;free bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium ions were prepared, and their reactivity was investigated. The compounds possess extreme Lewis acidity up to the strongest monocationic phosphonium&#8208;based fluoride ion acceptor isolable to date. Numerous novel phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperative reaction modes were observed toward silanes and unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.







Abstract
The first bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium salts are prepared and fully characterized. The perfluorinated derivative represents the strongest monocationic phosphorus Lewis acid on the fluoride and hydride ion affinity scale isolable to date. This affinity enables new reactions, such as hydride abstraction from Et3SiH, the first phosphaalkoxylation of an alkyne or a phosphorus catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation. All properties and reactions are scrutinized by theory and experiment. Substantial &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;acidity provides the required affinity for substrate activation, while phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperativity substantially enriches the reactivity portfolio of phosphonium ions.

         <title>Roles that Organic Ammoniums Play on the Surface of the Perovskite Film: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article summarizes recent research progresses about the surface treatment of the perovskite film using organic ammonium salts (OASs) for improved performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Diverse roles of OASs and their working principles are discussed, and key factors that influence the roles of OASs are proposed to suggest how to further promote efficiency and stability of PSCs.







Abstract
The roles of organic ammonium salts (OASs) which are widely used for the surface treatment of the perovskite film, including formation of 2D perovskites, direct surface passiviation, and other effects, have been reviewed. The influencing factors for these roles of OASs are also discussed, which are important for improved efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity in MnI&#8208;Catalysed N&#8208;Formylation of Secondary Amides and Lactams Using CO2 at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MnI complex coordinated with a redox non&#8208;innocent phenalenyl (PLY) ligand is reported for catalytic N&#8208;formylation of secondary amides (including late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutics) and lactams with CO2 as C1 source at room temperature for the first time. A combined approach of experimental analysis and DFT calculations sketch the plausible radical&#8208;mediated pathway of an unconventional metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, involving a ligand&#8208;centred radical.







Abstract
A MnI catalyst featuring redox&#8208;active tridentate phenalenyl (PLY) ligand has been used for catalytic N&#8208;formylation of secondary amides and lactams under 1&#8197;atm CO2 as a C1 source at room temperature for the first time. The protocol is applicable to a wide range of secondary amides including heterocycles, bio&#8208;active cinnamide derivatives and the diversification of therapeutic molecules. In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations based on experimental outcomes and DFT calculations suggested an unconventional metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, where a ligand&#8208;centred radical plays a crucial role in initiating the reaction process.

         <title>Preparation of N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl Imino Peptides and Their Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Diastereoselective Indolylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl imino dipeptides bearing various functional groups was successfully achieved using MnO2&#8208;mediated oxidation. Also the highly diastereoselective indolylation of the iminopeptides was realized, which allows selective access to each diastereomer of the adduct from the same substrate using an appropriate chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. The origin of the diastereoselectivity was elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl imino dipeptides bearing various functional groups were successfully prepared by MnO2&#8208;mediated oxidation and then subjected to diastereoselective indolylation. Each diastereomer of the adduct was selectively obtained from the same substrates using the appropriate chiral phosphoric acid catalysts. These transformations would be useful for synthesizing non&#8208;canonical amino acid&#8208;containing peptides as novel drug candidates.

         <title>A Triazolium&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Immolative Linker Enables Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Driven siRNA Binding and Esterase&#8208;Induced Release</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles lose the ability to bind siRNA upon addition of esterase, due to the degradation of the polar head group and conversion to a neutral triazole.







Abstract
The increased importance of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics comes with a need to develop next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive systems capable of binding, transporting and releasing RNA oligomers. In this work, we describe triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles capable of siRNA binding and enzyme&#8208;responsive release of the nucleic acid payload. In aqueous medium, the amphiphile self&#8208;assembles into nanocarriers that can disintegrate upon the addition of esterase. Key to the molecular design is a self&#8208;immolative linker that is anchored to the triazolium moiety and acts as a positively&#8208;charged polar head group. We demonstrate that addition of esterase leads to a degradation cascade of the linker, leaving the neutral triazole compound unable to form complexes and therefore releasing the negatively&#8208;charged siRNA. The reported molecular design and overall approach may have broad utility beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, because the underlying CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry allows bringing together three groups very efficiently as well as cleaving off one of the three groups under the mild action of an esterase enzyme.

         <title>Spontaneous Formation of Heterostructured Perovskite Films for Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing components and structures of heterostructured perovskite films is an efficient strategy to yield highly stable and efficient photovoltaic devices. In this concept, we have highlighted the progress in research on spontaneous formation behavior in perovskite composite layers and provided a perspective on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and future challenges and opportunities for perovskite heterostructural materials.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the one of most promising photovoltaic technologies that can be achieved by a simple solution process. At the current stage, the key issues concern further improvements in efficiency and operational lifetime. Constructing a self&#8208;assembled perovskite structure with manipulated chemical and physical properties is a useful and effective strategy to solve these problems. Herein, we review the basic principles of and recent progress in the spontaneous formation behavior of heterostructured perovskite thin films. This concept provides insightful clues for the design and fabrication of stable and efficient PSCs for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Transition Metal Oxides as Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving TMOs: The search for transition metal oxide (TMO) electrocatalysts is important but challenging. TMO electrocatalysts have the advantage of low cost, but also inherent disadvantages, such as poor electron conductivity. To meet industrial demands, better TMOs need to be identified by extensive searching, catalyst design, and structural engineering.







Abstract
As a sustainable energy technology, electrocatalytic energy conversion and storage has become increasingly prominent. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are the key steps in the industrial applications of energy conversion and storage. Compared to the widely used precious metal catalysts, less&#8208;noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) and TMO&#8208;like materials have attracted broad attention as electrocatalysts in the above reactions. In this concept, we summarize the challenges and opportunities of some typical TMOs in electrocatalysis, and modification strategies of TMOs as electrocatalysts are discussed.

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle Measurements: A Powerful Method for Investigating Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;particle measurements have been applied in the field of electrochemical energy storage as well as electrocatalysis, and great achievements have been made in terms of understanding the evolution and kinetics of electrodes.







Abstract
The relationship between interface structure (e.&#8201;g., the facet of the solid phase and the configuration of solvation) and the reactivity of the corresponding electrode is a critical issue in electrochemistry. Compared to macroscopic electrode measurements, electrochemical methods established on the single&#8208;particle scale have advantages in establishing the structure&#8208;property relationship. In recent years, great achievements have been made in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis that allow the evolution and kinetics of electrodes to be understood by employing single&#8208;particle measurements. This concept aims to provide an overview of the update of single&#8208;particle measurements in related electrochemical processes. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the development and application of single&#8208;particle measurements are also discussed.

     alt="Single-Particle Measurements: A Powerful Method for Investigating Electrochemical Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single-particle measurements&lt;/b&gt; have been applied in the field of electrochemical energy storage as well as electrocatalysis, and great achievements have been made in terms of understanding the evolution and kinetics of electrodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between interface structure (e.&#8201;g., the facet of the solid phase and the configuration of solvation) and the reactivity of the corresponding electrode is a critical issue in electrochemistry. Compared to macroscopic electrode measurements, electrochemical methods established on the single-particle scale have advantages in establishing the structure-property relationship. In recent years, great achievements have been made in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis that allow the evolution and kinetics of electrodes to be understood by employing single-particle measurements. This concept aims to provide an overview of the update of single-particle measurements in related electrochemical processes. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the development and application of single-particle measurements are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxychalcogenides: A Promising Materials Class for Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Mixed&#8208;anion Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are of great significance in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials remains a huge challenge due to the necessary but conflicting properties requirements of NLO materials. Notably, oxychalcogenides with mixed&#8208;anion groups have drawn extensive concerns as a family of important IR NLO candidates because they integrate the property advantages between oxides and chalcogenides by chemical substitution engineering. In this review, we provide a survey of the reported oxychalcogenides and aim to present the development of NLO oxychalcogenides from the perspective of the rational design of their structural chemistry. Furthermore, we focus on the relationships between partial substitution and structural symmetry as well as optical properties. These provide some helpful guidance for the further exploration and design of novel oxychalcogenide materials with excellent NLO performance in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Paramagnetic liquid crystals with close &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing: The effect of Blatter radical planarization on behavior of bent&#8208;core mesogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new, 19 &#960;&#8208;delocalized electrons planar Blatter radical building block was developed and used to obtain paramagnetic bent&#8208;core liquid crystals. The mesogens were investigated by optical, thermal, powder XRD and DFT methods in the pure form and as binary mixtures. Comparison of their properties with those of the classical Blatter radical analogues revealed that planarization of the central angular element results in a significantly higher stability of the mesophases and increased molecular organization suitable for the formation of organized banana and columnar mesophases with tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results indicate access to a new, potentially rich class of functional paramagnetic soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaryl&#8208;Substituted bis&#8208;Anils: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Derivatives with Tunable ESIPT Emission Color and pH Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;stepped synthesis, structural, and photophysical properties of a series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives presenting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process is described. The fluorescence color of the aggregates can be finely tuned by changing the electronic nature of the peripheral substitution, leading to a wide range of emission wavelengths (from green to the near infra&#8208;red). Moreover, upon introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as cyano (CN), a competition between ESIPT and deprotonation is observed leading to the emission of the anionic species at low water percentage. This observation led to the synthesis of an additional mixed AIE fluorophore, functionalized by methoxy groups on one side and cyano groups on the other side. Upon addition of water, this dye displays first anionic emission, followed by typical AIE/ESIPT red fluorescence upon formation of the aggregates. TD&#8208;DFT calculations on selected AIE dyes were performed to rationalize the nature of the emissive transitions in these derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Carbon&#8208;Dioxide Reduction by Tuning the Properties of Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suppressing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is an essential measure toward addressing global warming. Specifically, photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks using sunlight and water. However, the practical application of photocatalyst&#8208;promoting CRR (CRR photocatalysts) requires significant improvement of their conversion efficiency. Accordingly, extensive research is being conducted toward the improvement of semiconductor photocatalysts, as well as cocatalysts that are loaded as active sites on the photocatalysts. In this review, we summarize recent research and development trends on the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. We expect that the advanced knowledge provided on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR in this review will serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis: Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cyclocondensation of (in situ Generated) Aryl Imines with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron&#8208;rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium&#8208;based derivatives and their use in different applications such as organocatalysis. In this context, we present herein the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction. Different dienophiles as well as imines of variable electronic nature efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three&#8208;component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N&#8208;phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22&#8208;38 M&#8208;1 were measured in dichloromethane.</dc:description>

         <title>Diarylethene isomerization using triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation photon upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation photon upconversion using the well&#8208;studied upconversion pair 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA)/platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) is used to reversibly drive the photoisomerization of diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches using visible light. By carefully selecting the kinetic and spectral properties of the molecular system as well as the experimental geometry, a single green light source can be used to selectively trigger both the ring&#8208;opening and the ring&#8208;closing reactions, whilst also inducing fluorescence from the closed colored isomer that can be used as a readout to monitor the isomerization process in situ. The upconversion solution and the DAE solution are kept physically separated, allowing to characterize them both concomitantly and individually without further separation processes. The ring&#8208;closing reaction using upconverted photons is quantified and compared to the efficiency of direct isomerization using ultraviolet light.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic synthesis of acetals and ketals from aldehydes and silylenolethers without the use of acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetals and ketals are among the most important protecting groups for carbonyl compounds. A new method for the acetalization and ketalization was developed by means of photoredox catalysis. The biscyanolated perylene bisimide is used as electron&#8208;poor photocatalyst, together with green light (525 nm LED). Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes react efficiently to acetals in good to excellent yields. A broad substrate range was shown with respect to both the aldehydes and the alcohols. The functional group tolerance is high. Especially acid&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;labile protecting groups are tolerated. Aldehydes can also be directly and selectively converted into the respective acetals. Only ketones must be converted to their silylenolethers before ketalization. This photocatalytic method works completely without the use of acids or photoacids, and does not need any additives or H&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Hence, it broadens the substrate scope and repertoire of photo&#8208;redox catalysis with respect to carbonyl chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation, Reactivity and Decomposition of Aryl Phospha&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and reactivity of two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(SiiPr3)OLi]2 (R=Mes, Mes*) is described. Derivatization at the oxygen atom with electrophiles is possible, facilitating subsequent reactivity pathways including, for example, spontaneous decarbonylation.







Abstract
Two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(SiiPr3)OLi]2 were prepared by reaction of triisopropyl silyl phosphaethynolate, iPr3SiPCO, with aryl lithium reagents LiR (R=Mes: 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl phenyl; or Mes*: 1,3,5,&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl phenyl). Monomer/dimer aggregation of the enolates can be modulated by addition of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Substitution of lithium for a heavier alkali metal was achieved through initial formation of a silyl enol ether, followed by reaction with KOtBu to form the corresponding potassium phospha&#8208;enolate [MesP=C(SiiPr3)OK]2. On addition of water, the enolates are protonated to afford RP=C(SiiPr3)(OH). For the sterically less demanding system (R=Mes), this phospha&#8208;enol rapidly tautomerises to the corresponding acyl phosphine MesP(H)C(SiiPr3)(O), which on heating extrudes CO. In contrast, bulkier phospha&#8208;enol (R=Mes*) is stable to rearrangement at room temperature and thermally decomposes to RH and iPr3SiPCO.

         <title>Assembly of Rolling Circle Amplification&#8208;Produced Ultralong Single&#8208;Stranded DNA to Construct Biofunctional DNA Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA materials have attracted considerable attention in biomedical applications due to their predictable structure and designable functions. Recently, various biofunctional DNA materials have been developed through rolling circle amplification (RCA). Herein, the assembly strategies to construct RCA&#8208;based DNA material in recent years are summarized in two main parts, including the construction of DNA hydrogel and DNA nanocomplex.

The U&#8208;shaped diaminophenazine displayed photoluminescence in solution with moderate quantum yield. The diamino aromatic compound was found applicable to the poly&#8208;condensation with formaldehyde to form Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base ladder polymer. The obtained microporous ladder polymer features high CO2 adsorption selectivity against N2, most likely due to the presence of basic nitrogen atoms in the phenazine rings.</dc:description>

         <title>N,N&#8208;Diphenyl Dihydrophenazines: Using &#960;&#8208;Extension to Access Dicationic Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrophenazines are receiving increasing attention due to applications in numerous fields of chemistry, from light emission to organo&#8208;photocatalysis. Despite this growing interest and numerous works involving the preparation of radical cations based on this scaffold, the isolation and study of the aromatic dications obtained by 2 electron oxidation of dihydrophenazines is still mostly unexplored. From this point of view, along with the substitution at the N atoms generally used to tune dihydrophenazine properties, the p&#8208;extension of the phenazine core could play a crucial role in making dicationic states accessible. This could result in an extension of the knowledge on these elusive dications and in potentially highly interesting applications ranging from material science to molecular actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Counterions in the Structural Stabilisation of Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structures of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically determined by the strong chemical bonds formed between the organic and inorganic building units. However, the latest generation of redox&#8208;active frameworks often rely on counterions in the pores to access specific charge states of the components. Here, we model the crystal structures of three layered MOFs based on the redox&#8208;active ligand 2,5&#8208;dihyroxybenzoquinone (dhbq): Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, V2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 with implicit and explicit counterions. Our full&#8208;potential first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that while the reported hexagonal structure is readily obtained for Ti and V, the Fe framework is stabilised only by the presence of explicit counterions. For high counterion concentrations, we observe the formation of an electride&#8208;like pocket in the pore center. An outlook is provided on the implications of solvent and counterion control for engineering the structures and properties of porous solids.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations in a Mixed Porphyrin(Cu2+)/Trityl Spin System: Magnitude, Sign and Distribution of the Exchange Coupling Constant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals (TAM or trityl) are receiving increasing attention in various fields of magnetic resonance, such as imaging, dynamic nuclear polarization, spin labeling, and, more recently, molecular magnetism and quantum information technology. Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of 2.3 GHz (0.077 cm&#8208;1 (JS1S2 convention) and a distribution width of 1.2 GHz (0.040 cm&#8208;1). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers.

Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi-frequency continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin-spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of 2.3 GHz (0.077 cm-1 (JS1S2 convention) and a distribution width of 1.2 GHz (0.040 cm-1). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para-substituted phenyl-bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers. This study exemplifies the importance of molecular dynamics for the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the magnetic properties of trityl-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Aggregation Control in Polyoxometalates Covalently Functionalized with Oligoaromatic Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CLICK&#8208;chemistry has become a universal route to covalently link organic molecules functionalized with azides and alkynes, respectively. Here, we report how CLICK&#8208;chemistry can be used to attach oligoaromatic organic moieties to Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates. In step one, the lacunary Dawson anion [&#945;2&#8208;P2W17O61]6&#8208; is functionalized with phosphonate anchors featuring peripheral azide groups. In step two, this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid undergoes microwave&#8208;assisted CLICK coupling. We demonstrate the versatility of this route to access a series of Dawson anions covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups. The supramolecular chemistry and aggregation of these systems in solution is explored, and we report distinct changes in charge&#8208;transfer behavior depending on the size of the oligoaromatic &#960; &#8211; system.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the photophysical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers by functionalization of skeleton, to achieve an optically and electronically advantageous building block for organic semiconductor materials is a vital yet challenging task. In this work, a series of structurally well&#8208;defined polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers for the first time. This new synthetic strategy nicely circumvents the cumbersome substituent introduction process in the later stage by preinstall of the desired aryl groups in the starting material. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties. These novel &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s have good hole transport capacity and can function as hole&#8208;transporting layers in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, indicative of significant breakthrough in the application of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans materials in OLEDs.

         <title>Observation and Characterization of the Hg&#8208;O Diatomic Molecule: A Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mercury atoms from laser ablation of a dental amalgam target react with oxygen atoms upon co&#8208;condensation in excess argon and neon, and they provide frequencies of 521.2 and 529.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively, which support high&#8208;level calculations for this weakly bound Hg&#8722;O diatomic molecule. The small difference between our neon and argon matrix observations for Hg&#8722;O suggest a slightly ionic molecule. Spectra are also observed for Hg&#8208;O2 and Hg&#8208;O3.







Abstract
Mercuric oxide is a well&#8208;known and stable solid, but the diatomic molecule Hg&#8722;O is very fragile and does not survive detection in the gas phase. However, laser ablation of Hg atoms from a dental amalgam alloy target into argon or neon containing about 0.3&#8201;% of 16O2 or of 18O2 during their condensation into a cryogenic matrix at 4&#8197;K allows the formation of O atoms which react on annealing to make ozone and new IR absorptions in solid argon at 521.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg&#8208;16O or at 496.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg&#8208;18O with the oxygen isotopic frequency ratio 521.2/496.4=1.0499. Solid neon gives a 529.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 absorption with a small 7.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1 blue shift. CCSD(T) calculations found 594&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg16O and 562&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for Hg18O (frequency ratio=1.0569). Such calculations usually produce harmonic frequencies that are slightly higher than the anharmonic (observed) values, which supports their relationship. These observed frequencies have the isotopic shift predicted for Hg&#8722;O and are within the range of recent high&#8208;level frequency calculations for the Hg&#8722;O molecule. Spectra for the related mercury superoxide and ozonide species are also considered for the first time.

         <title>Phospholenes from Phosphabenzenes by Selective Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A six&#8208;membered phosphabenzene contracts to a five&#8208;membered hydroxylphospholene oxide in the presence of hydrochloric acid. This unusual reaction can only proceed because the special electronic properties of phosphinines, in combination with the particular reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate organophosphorus species, allow sequential reactions at the aromatic phosphorus heterocycles; this is in clear contrast to functionalized pyridines. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. M&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203406).

         <title>Modifying the St&#246;ber Process: Is the Organic Solvent Indispensable?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solvents are not indispensable in the St&#246;ber method and its extensions. Ethanol produced from the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) already makes the reactants miscible and completes the synthesis. A simple organic solvent&#8208;free alternative to the St&#246;ber process enables the synthesis of controllable uniform silica spheres and has the potential to be extended to other St&#246;ber process&#8208;based material syntheses.







Abstract
The St&#246;ber method is one of the most important and fundamental processes for the synthesis of inorganic (nano)materials but has the drawback of using a large amount of organic solvent. Herein, ethanol was used as an example to explore if the organic solvent in a typical St&#246;ber method can be omitted. It was found that ethanol increases the particle size of the obtained silica spheres and aids the formation of uniform silica particles rather than forming a gel. Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. An initially immiscible synthesis method was discovered, which can replace the organic solvent&#8208;based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value for the extension to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.

         <title>Long&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells: Materials and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are reviewed from the perspectives of materials, including ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites, as well as device engineering. Device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting the microcavity effect, and light outcoupling enhancement, are also discussed. This review aims to pave the way for researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.







Abstract
Long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are potential deep&#8208;red and near infrared light sources with solution&#8208;processable simple device architecture, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrodes. Many scientific efforts have been made to material design and device engineering of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs over the past two decades. The materials designed the for long&#8208;wavelength LECs cover ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites. On the other hand, device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting microcavity effect, light outcoupling enhancement, energy down&#8208;conversion from color conversion layers, and adjusting intermolecular interactions, are also helpful in improving the device performance of long&#8208;wavelength LECs. In this review, recent advances in the long&#8208;wavelength LECs are reviewed from the viewpoints of materials and device engineering. Finally, discussions on conclusion and outlook indicate possible directions for future developments of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs. This review would like to pave the way for the researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for the long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.

         <title>Going Viral: An Investigation into the Chameleonic Behaviour of Antiviral Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy revealed three antiviral drugs in the bRo5 space to behave as &#8220;partial&#8221; molecular chameleons. Their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area is proposed to improve their cell permeability and contribute to oral absorption. A fourth drug was found not to be chameleonic.







Abstract
The ability to adjust conformations in response to the polarity of the environment, i.e. molecular chameleonicity, is considered to be important for conferring both high aqueous solubility and high cell permeability to drugs in chemical space beyond Lipinski's rule of 5. We determined the conformational ensembles populated by the antiviral drugs asunaprevir, simeprevir, atazanavir and daclatasvir in polar (DMSO&#8208;d6) and non&#8208;polar (chloroform) environments with NMR spectroscopy. Daclatasvir was fairly rigid, whereas the first three showed large flexibility in both environments, that translated into major differences in solvent accessible 3D polar surface area within each conformational ensemble. No significant differences in size and polar surface area were observed between the DMSO&#8208;d6 and chloroform ensembles of these three drugs. We propose that such flexible compounds are characterized as &#8220;partial molecular chameleons&#8221; and hypothesize that their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area contributes to their membrane permeability and oral absorption.

         <title>Rational Design of a Triple Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform for Enhanced Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multiple TMEs&#8208;responsive nanoplatform was designed and synthesized. The nanoplatform constructed by of rare earth nanoparticles and layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs), It serves as a TMEs stimulation response nanoplatform for enhanced synergistic therapy.







Abstract
The development of responsive nanoplatforms based on the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Concentrating on a single TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform, however, may result in insufficient diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Herein, layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs) and rare earth nanomaterials (Er@Lu) were combined to create a triple TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform that was then modified with cypate (a fluorescent dye with strong absorbance) by a peptide chain and loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a chemotherapeutic drug. Multiple responses to TME occurred when Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG reached the colorectal tumor region. Based on an acidic TME, the nanoplatform cracked and released Ni2+ and EGCG. NiS, which was produced by the reaction of Ni2+ with abundant H2S in tumor cells, was used for photothermal therapy and the released EGCG was used for chemotherapy. The MMP&#8208;7 enzyme specifically expressed in tumor cells recognized and cut the peptide chain, resulting in cypate release. The fluorescence of the Er@Lu was then restored along with the release of cypate because of the absorption competition disappearance. Compared to a single TME response, Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG with a triple TME response led to a better synergistic therapeutic effect in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This work has provided new approaches for developing multiple TME&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoplatforms for synergistic therapy with improved diagnosis and therapeutic efficiency.

         <title>Sulfation of Heparan and Chondroitin Sulfate Ligands Enables Cell&#8208;Specific Homing of Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic ligands for nanoprobes: GAG nanoprobes composed of synthetic heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate ligands give a broad picture of cell&#8208;specific homing of nanoparticles and provide a novel opportunity for nanomedicine. Chondroitin sulfate E is a potential ligand for designing nanoprobes to target CD44&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and neurites.







Abstract
Demystifying the sulfation code of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to induce precise homing of nanoparticles in tumor cells or neurons influences the development of a potential drug&#8208; or gene&#8208;delivery system. However, GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are structurally highly heterogeneous, and synthesizing well&#8208;defined HS/CS composed nanoparticles is challenging. Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor&#8208;mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG&#8208;nanoprobes compared to mild or moderately aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, thus indicating the presence of more than one form of receptor&#8208;mediated uptake. However, U87 cells, olfactory bulb, and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS&#8208;E&#8208;coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG&#8208;nanoprobes. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that the 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;disulfated&#8208;CS nanoprobe used the CD44 and caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis pathway for uptake. These results could lead to new opportunities to use GAG nanoprobes in nanomedicine.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Perfluoroalkylvinylation of Alkenes Enabled by Dual DBU/Fe Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of an efficient DBU/iron co&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component perfluoroalkylvinylation of alkenes has been reported through a radical process under mild conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a simple and efficient strategy that involves dual 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU)/iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene perfluoroalkylvinylation by using perfluoroalkyl iodides and 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones as coupling partners is demonstrated. In terms of the developed catalytic system, various styrenes and aliphatic alkenes are well&#8208;tolerated, leading to the accurate preparation of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones in excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, the protocol can be readily applied in late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The title reactions are featured by easily accessible and inexpensive catalysts and substrates, broad substrate applicability, and mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a tandem C&#8722;I cleavable alkylation and C&#8722;C vinylation enabled by cooperative DBU/iron catalysis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Formylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of alkyl chlorides to synthesize aldehydes has been developed. Depending on the conditions both linear and branched aldehydes can be obtained in a selective manner from readily available substrates.







Abstract
The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of non&#8208;activated alkyl chlorides with syn gas (H2/CO) allows to produce aldehydes in high yields (25 examples). A catalyst optimization study revealed Rh(acac)(CO)2 in the presence of 1,3&#8208;bisdiphenylphosphinopropane (DPPP) as the most active catalyst system for this transformation. Key for the success of the reaction is the addition of sodium iodide (NaI) to the reaction system, which leads to the formation of activated alkyl iodides as intermediates. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the linear or branched aldehydes can be preferentially obtained, which is explained by a different mechanism.

         <title>Bis(Vinylenedithio)&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulphurous lateral interactions. For electroactive coordination polymers, through space charge transport phenomenon are most often 1D. By increasing the size of the electroactive core, lateral sulphur&#8208;sulphur interaction take place and create a 2D conducting pathway. Post&#8208;synthetic oxidation is used to increase the materials conductivity.







Abstract
Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal&#8208;organic frameworks were reported to yield through&#8208;space conducting frameworks, the use of S&#8208;enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT&#8208;TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) coordination polymer. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner. These results are shedding light to comprehend how to improve through&#8208;space conductivity thanks to sulfur enriched ligands.

         <title>Reversing the Bond Length Alternation Order in Conjugated Polyenes by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesised several push&#8208;pull substituted conjugated polyenes and determined their accurate C&#8211;C bond lengths and charge&#8208;density distribution by utilising quantum crystallographic techniques. In a series of alkene, diene, and triene bearing two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (triflyl) groups on the terminal carbon atom, unique reversal of the bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) order has been observed. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the Lewis structure&#8208;based neutral resonance structure. Such reversal of BLA order has not been observed in push&#8208;pull compounds bearing conventional electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and cyano groups instead of triflyl groups. Bonding behaviour of both normal and reversed bond length alternating systems has been revealed by complementary bonding analysis using several bond descriptors based on the experimentally fitted wavefunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conformal Carbon Nanolayer Coated Fe2O3 Cocatalyst for the Promoted Activity of Plasma&#8208;Sputtered BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To simultaneously improve the hole extraction ability of the BiVO4 photoanode and accelerate the surface reaction kinetics, herein, a carbon nanolayer&#8208; conformally coated Fe2O3 (C&#8208;Fe2O3) as oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is loaded on the H2 plasma treated nanoporous BiVO4 (BVO(H2)) surface by a hydrothermal reaction. It is found that the H2 plasma induced vacancies in BVO remarkably increases the conductivity, and the C&#8208;Fe2O3 enables hole extraction from the bulk to the surface as well as efficient hole injection to the electrolyte. As a result, the C&#8208;Fe2O3/BVO(H2) photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 4.4 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an ABPE value of 1.5% at 0.68 V vs. RHE, which are 4.8&#8208;fold and 13&#8208;fold higher than that of BVO photoanode, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>How Bases Catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All about that base! Our quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how bases can effectively catalyze the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by promoting both the normal electron demand orbital interactions and electrostatic interactions. This study demonstrates the underlying mechanistic differences between the base&#8208;catalyzed and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reactions.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the base&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone and N&#8208;methylmaleimide using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO2 via a retro&#8208;DA reaction. Base catalysis, for example, by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO2, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: i) by the HOMO&#8208;raising effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and ii) by donating charge into 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N&#8208;methylmaleimide.

At 160 &#176;C in mesitylene bis(1&#8208;naphthylmethyl)tin dichloride undergoes Sn&#8722;C homolytic cleavage to generate two 1&#8208;naphthylmethyl radicals (1&#8208;C10H7CH2&#8226;) which were trapped by TEMPO (C9H8NO&#8226;). Subsequently, the radicals (RCH2&#8226;) produced in this manner were utilized for efficient substitution reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes (R&#8242;H; R&#8242; = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 1,2,4,5&#8208;Me4C6H, 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Me5C6) to obtain a variety of unsymmetrical diarylmethanes (RR&#180;CH2). The addition of one equivalent of iodine (I2) to the reaction mixture resulted in a significant increase in the yields of coupled products.</dc:description>

Subsequently, the radicals (RCH2&#8226;) produced in this manner were utilized for efficient substitution reactions with electron-rich arenes (R&#8242;H; R&#8242; = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, 1,2,4,5-Me4C6H, 1,2,3,4,5-Me5C6) to obtain a variety of unsymmetrical diarylmethanes (RR&#180;CH2). The addition of one equivalent of iodine (I2) to the reaction mixture resulted in a significant increase in the yields of coupled products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Twisting Affects the Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Reactions of Unsaturated Ketones and the Photomechanical Effects of Molecular Crystals</title>

         <dc:description>
The degree of the double&#8208;bond torsion in chalcones has a significant effect on the solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;chemical reactivity to tune the photomechanical effects of their crystals.







Abstract
Three groups of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X=F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo&#8208;induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of the crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. Cyclic 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to undergo trans&#8208;cis isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman&#8208;based molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and trans&#8208;cis isomerization simultaneously took place in crystals. Photo&#8208;induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid&#8208;state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.

Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo-induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of the crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. Cyclic 3,4-dihydronaphthalene-based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to undergo &lt;i&gt;trans-cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate.

         <dc:description>Multiple spectroscopic techniques, along with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, have been used to reveal the detailed structural and electronic information on reaction intermediates of a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system for the N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;Azaindole. The reaction mixture of Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling yields two dimeric copper(II)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole complexes, including one attached with DBU, prior to adding arylboronic acid and are confirmed structurally and spectroscopically.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on cluster&#8208;mediated C&#8211;N bond formation in the gas phase using N2 as a nitrogen source. The V3C+ + N2 reaction is studied by a combination of ion&#8208;trap mass spectrometry with infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and complemented by electronic structure calculations. The proposed reaction mechanism is spectroscopically validated by identifying the structures of the reactant and product ions. V3C+ exhibits a pyramidal structure of C1 symmetry. N2 activation is initiated by adsorption in an end&#8208;on fashion at a vanadium site, followed by spontaneous cleavage of the N&#8801;N triple bond and subsequent C&#8722;N coupling. The IRPD spectrum of the metal nitride product [NV3(C=N)]+ exhibits characteristic C=N double bond (1530 cm&#8208;1) and V&#8208;N single bond (770, 541 and 522 cm&#8208;1) stretching bands.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR Investigation of Protein&#8208;Carbohydrate Interactions: The Recognition of Glycans by Galectins Engineered with Fluorotryptophan Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of single&#8208;19F&#8208;tryptophan residues into two glycan binding proteins, Galectin&#8208;3 and Galectin&#8208;8, was exploited to monitor their binding to carbohydrate ligands by using NMR spectroscopy. Although the affinity of the molecular recognition events was not substantially altered, 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy provided interesting added values with respect to other NMR binding strategies.







Abstract
Fluorine (19F) incorporation into glycan&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) has been achieved and exploited to monitor the binding to carbohydrate ligands by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Galectins are a family of lectins that bind carbohydrates, generally with weak affinities, through a combination of intermolecular interactions including a key CH&#8208;&#960; stacking involving a conserved tryptophan residue. Herein, Galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3) and Galectin&#8208;8 (Gal8) with one and two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), respectively, were selected. Gal3 contains one Trp, whereas Gal8 contains three, one at each binding site and a third one not involved in sugar binding; these were substituted by the corresponding F&#8208;Trp analogues. The presence of fluorine did not significantly modify the affinity for glycan binding, which was in slow exchange on the 19F NMR chemical&#8208;shift timescale, even for weak ligands, and allowed binding events taking place at two different binding sites within the same lectin to be individualized.

         <title>Experimentally Calibrated Computational Prediction Enables Accurate Fine&#8208;Tuning of Near&#8208;Infrared Rhodamines for Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calibration to experimental data produces accurate computational predictions of NIR dye absorbance and emission for unknown derivatives, allowing for identification of fine&#8208;tuning modifications.







Abstract
A significant barrier inhibiting multiplexed imaging in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) is the extensive trial and error associated with fine&#8208;tuning NIR dyes. In particular, the need to synthesize and experimentally evaluate dye derivatives in order to empirically identify those that can be used in multiplexing applications, requires a large investment of time. While coarse&#8208;tuning efforts benefit from computational prediction that can be used to identify target dye structures for synthetic campaigns, errors in computational prediction remain too large to accurately parse modifications aimed at fine&#8208;tuning changes in dye absorbance and emission. To address this issue, we screened different levels of theory and identified a time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) approach that can rapidly, as opposed to synthesis and experimental evaluation, estimate absorbance and emission. By calibrating these computational estimations of absorbance and emission to experimentally determined parameters for a panel of existing NIR dyes, we obtain calibration curves that can be used to accurately predict the effect of fine&#8208;tuning modifications in new dyes. We demonstrate the predictive power of this calibrated dataset using seven previously unreported dyes, obtaining mean percent errors in absorbance and emission of 2.2 and 2.8&#8201;%, respectively. This approach provides a significant timesavings, relative to synthesis and evaluation of dye derivatives, and can be used to focus synthetic campaigns on the most promising dye structures. The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine&#8208;tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.

The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine-tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Physical Properties of Tunable Aryl Alkyl Ionic Liquids (TAAILs) Comprising Imidazolium Cations Blocked with Methyl&#8208;, Propyl&#8208; and Phenyl&#8208;Groups at the C2 Position</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blocking the C2 position of imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) with methyl, propyl and phenyl groups has a strong influence on their physicochemical properties like viscosity and conductivity. Especially the electrochemical window can be enlarged. Electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents on the aryl ring could further change the electron density which has also been analyzed by quantum chemical DFT calculations.







Abstract
Imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids are very popular for different applications because of their low viscosity and melting point. However, the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the imidazolium cation can easily be deprotonated by a base, resulting in a reactive carbene. If an inert ionic liquid is needed, it is necessary to introduce an unreactive alkyl or aryl group at the C2 position to prevent deprotonation. Tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) were first introduced by our group in 2009 and are characterized by a phenyl group at the N1 position, which offers the possibility to fine&#8208;tune the physicochemical properties by using different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing substituents. In this work, we present a new series of TAAILs where the C2 position is blocked by a methyl, propyl or phenyl group. For each of the blocking groups, the phenyl and three different phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F2) are compared with respect to melting point, viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window. In addition, the differences between blocked and unblocked TAAILs with regard to their electrochemical reduction potentials are investigated by quantum chemical methods.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding in Platinum Indolylphosphine Polyfluorido and Fluorido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tune it! Platinum fluorido and polyfluorido complexes stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen were synthesized. X&#8208;ray data suggest a lower trans influence for electron withdrawing aryl ligands in the para position to the fluoride, but simultaneously a larger cis influence was observed, which is mirrored by the 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants. The |1J(F,Pt)| coupling constants were found to be smaller for fluorido complexes when compared to polyfluorido complexes.







Abstract
The reaction of the Pt complexes cis&#8208;[Pt(CH3)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] (Ind=2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolyl, Ar=4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (1&#8201;a), 4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (1&#8201;b), Ph (1&#8201;c), 4&#8208;FC6H4 (1&#8201;d), 4&#8208;ClC6H4 (1&#8201;e), 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (1&#8201;f)) with HF afforded the polyfluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F(HF)2)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] 2&#8201;a&#8211;f, which can be converted into the fluoride derivatives trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(Ar){Ph2P(Ind)}2] (3&#8201;a&#8211;f) by treatment with CsF. The compounds 2&#8201;a&#8211;f and 3&#8201;a&#8211;f were characterised thoroughly by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The data reveal hydrogen bonding of the fluorido ligand with HF molecules and the indolylphosphine ligand. Polyfluorido complexes 2&#8201;a&#8211;f show larger |1J(F,Pt)|, but lower 1J(H,F) coupling constants when compared to the fluorido complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;f. Decreasing 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants in 2&#8201;a&#8211;f and 3&#8201;a&#8211;f suggest a cis influence of the aryl ligands in the following order: 4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (a) &#8776;4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (b)&lt;Ph (c)&#8810;4&#8208;FC6H4 (d)&lt;4&#8208;ClC6H4 (e)&lt;4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (f). In addition, the larger cis influence of aryl ligands bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in the para position correlates with decreasing magnitudes of |1J(F,Pt)| coupling constants. The interpretation of the experimental data was supported by quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations.

         <title>Separation of Tellurium from Metal Chalcogenides through Mild Anhydrous Chlorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photovoltaic waste: The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatechol. This procedure also proved to give a significant separation of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium from a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides.







Abstract
The separation of tellurium from cadmium telluride is examined using a unique combination of mild, anhydrous chlorination and complexation of the subsequent tellurium tetrachloride with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcatecholate ligands (dtbc). The resulting tellurium complex, Te(dtbc)2, is isolated in moderate yield and features a 103 to 104 reduction in cadmium content, as provided by XRF and ICP&#8208;MS analysis. Similar results were obtained from zinc telluride. A significant separation between Te, Se, and S was observed after treating a complex mixture of metal chalcogenides with this protocol. These three tunable steps can be applied for future applications of CdTe photovoltaic waste.

         <title>Caging of a Strongly Pairing Fluorescent Thymidine Analog with Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasing the base pairing partner: A pyridone C&#8208;nucleoside is reported that binds very tightly to adenine as complementary base. Upon exposure to soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione or selenocysteine, the new base reacts and releases its grip on the base pairing partner, allowing for the dissociation of duplexes. At the same time, the C&#8208;nucleoside changes its fluorescence signature, providing a visual signal for the transformation.







Abstract
Controlling the pairing strength of nucleobases in DNA through reactions with compounds found inside the cell is a formidable challenge. Here we report how a thiazolyl substituent turns a strongly pairing ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside into a reactive residue in oligonucleotides. The thiazolyl&#8208;bearing pyridone reacts with soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione, but not with hard nucleophiles like hydroxide or carbonate. The addition products pair much more weakly with adenine in a complementary strand than the starting material, and also change their fluorescence. This makes oligonucleotides containing the new deoxynucleoside interesting for controlled release. Due to its reactivity toward N, P, S, and Se&#8208;nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the pairing strength of nucleobases in DNA through reactions with compounds found inside the cell is a formidable challenge. Here we report how a thiazolyl substituent turns a strongly pairing ethynylpyridone &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-nucleoside into a reactive residue in oligonucleotides. The thiazolyl-bearing pyridone reacts with soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione, but not with hard nucleophiles like hydroxide or carbonate. The addition products pair much more weakly with adenine in a complementary strand than the starting material, and also change their fluorescence. This makes oligonucleotides containing the new deoxynucleoside interesting for controlled release. Due to its reactivity toward &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Placing CF2 in the Center: Major Physicochemical Changes Upon a Minor Structural Alteration in Gem&#8208;Difunctional Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large increase in lipophilicity is observed for CH2/CF2 replacement in the center of di&#8208;functional compounds. The increase, in the range of 0.6&#8211;1.4&#8197;units is for most cases, far above expected values. The effect is nearly additive, thus one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one using a limited number of H/F exchanges. In this paper, the effect and its origins are explored.







Abstract
Fluorine atoms play an important role in all branches of chemistry and accordingly, it is very important to study their unique and varied effects systematically, in particular, the structure&#8208;physicochemical properties relationship. The present study describes exceptional physicochemical effects resulting from a H/F exchange at the methylene bridge of gem&#8208;difunctional compounds. The &#916;log P(CF2&#8208;CH2) values, that is, the change in lipophilicity, observed for the CH2/CF2 replacement in various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and thiophenoxy&#8208;esters/amides, diketones, benzodioxoles and more, fall in the range of 0.6&#8211;1.4&#8197;units, which for most cases, is far above the values expected for such a replacement. Moreover, for compounds holding more than one such gem&#8208;difunctional moiety, the effect is nearly additive, so one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one in a limited number of H/F exchanges. DFT studies of some of these systems revealed that polarity, conformational preference as well as charge distributions are strongly affected by such hydrogen to fluorine atom substitution. The pronounced effects described, are a result of the interplay between changes in polarity, H&#8208;bond basicity and molecular volume, which were obtained with a very low &#8216;cost&#8217; in terms of molecular weight or steric effects and may have a great potential for implementation in various fields of chemical sciences.

Luminescent Crystalline Carbon&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Triphenylamine Hybrids (Han et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Developing luminescent radicals with tunable emission is a challenging task due to the limitation of alternative skeletons. Herein, a series of carbene&#8208;triphenylamine hybrids were prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline. These hybrids showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to carbon&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with blue&#8208;to&#8208;cyan emissions (&#955;max: 436&#8211;486&#8197;nm) or nitrogen&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with orange emissions (&#955;max: 590&#8211;623&#8197;nm) through chemical reduction or oxidation, respectively. The radical species were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry analysis. Notably, the corresponding nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals exhibited good stability in atmospheric air, and their thermal decomposition temperatures were determined to be above 200&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, spectral and theoretical calculations indicate that all radicals exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha emissions.

         <title>Theoretical Exploration on the Role of Magnetic States to the N2 Fixation behaviors of 2D Transition Metal Tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic states affect the adsorption of intermediates. A key discovery is TMB3s, which are highly intrinsic active, stable, and have a large number of active sites for intrinsic electrocatalysis. More importantly, the role of TMBs in NRR with rich magnetic states is investigated. Among them, different magnetic states have different adsorption strengths for NRR intermediates, while there is no effect on the activation of nitrogen, making TMB3 a catalyst for NRR that is magnetically stable.







Abstract
Fixing nitrogen (N2) by electrosynthesis method has become a promising way to ammonia (NH3) production, nevertheless, developing electrocatalysts combining long&#8208;term stable and low&#8208;cost feathers are still a great challenge to date. Using comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations, we herein investigate the potential of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s) as nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts, and explore the effect of magnetic orders on the NRR. Our results show that the TMB3s can sufficiently activate N2 and convert it to NH3. Particularly, TiB3 is identified as a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for NRR because of its low limiting potential (&#8722;0.24&#8197;V) and good suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, we present that these TMB3s with various magnetic states exhibit different performances in the adsorption of N2 and NRR intermediates, and minor effect on activation of N2. Besides, VB3, CrB3, MnB3, and FeB3 monolayers possess the superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation via the self&#8208;activating process, which reduces *O/*OH into *H2O under NRR electrochemical conditions, thus favoring the N2 electroreduction. This work paves the way for finding high&#8208;performance NRR catalysts for transition metal borides and pioneering the research of magnetic states effects in NRR.

         <title>Phosphorescent Metal Halide Nanoclusters for Tunable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorescent metal halide nanoclusters have been described for tunable photodynamic therapy. Modulating the short chain fatty acid length on the apical halide ligand of phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum&#8208;based nanoclusters facilitates cellular uptake and improves phototoxicity in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Following photoexcitation, the nanoclusters produce singlet oxygen to cause cancer cell death. Image created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently limited by the inability of photosensitizers (PSs) to enter cancer cells and generate sufficient reactive oxygen species. Utilizing phosphorescent triplet states of novel PSs to generate singlet oxygen offers exciting possibilities for PDT. Here, we report phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters (NC) with tunable toxicity for PDT of cancer cells without use of rare or toxic elements. Upon irradiation with blue light, these molecules are excited to their singlet state and then undergo intersystem crossing to their triplet state. These NCs display surprising tunability between their cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity by modulating the apical halide ligand with a series of short chain fatty acids from trifluoroacetate to heptafluorobutyrate. The NCs are effective in PDT against breast, skin, pancreas, and colon cancer cells as well as their highly metastatic derivatives, demonstrating the robustness of these NCs in treating a wide variety of aggressive cancer cells. Furthermore, these NCs are internalized by cancer cells, remain in the lysosome, and can be modulated by the apical ligand to produce singlet oxygen. Thus, (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters are an excellent platform for optimizing PSs. Our results highlight the profound impact of molecular nanocluster chemistry in PDT applications.
