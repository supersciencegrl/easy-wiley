      <title>Electrochemical and Solvent&#8208;Mediated Visible&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopic Switching of Benzoselenadiazole Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>
Color chart: A fluorophore whose emission spans the visible to the NIR regions depending on solvent has been prepared. Its visible color reversibly bleached upon electrochemical oxidation with the concomitant formation of a new absorption peak in the NIR. Its fluorescence could also be quenched by applying a potential.







Abstract
A series of electronic push&#8211;pull, pull&#8211;pull, and push fluorophores has been prepared from a benzoselenadiazole core so that their spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectro&#8208;electrochemical, and spectro&#8208;electrofluorescence properties could be examined. The emission wavelengths and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;fl) of the N,N&#8208;dimethyl fluorophores were contingent on the solvent polarity and they ranged from 615 to 850&#8197;nm in aprotic solvents. The positive solvatochromism and the quenched &#934;fl in polar solvents were consistent with an intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state (ICT). Meanwhile, a locally excited state (LE) was assigned in nonpolar solvents from the blue&#8208;shifted emission and high &#934;fl. The N,N&#8208;dimethylamine fluorophores examined could be both electrochemically oxidized and reduced, whereas the symmetric dinitro pull&#8211;pull derivative could be only reversibly reduced. Courtesy of their electrochemical reversibility, the fluorophores could reversibly change color from yellow to blue with an applied potential in addition to switching off their emission. The absorption of the electrochemically generated intermediates of the N,N&#8208;dimethyl derivatives spanned 500&#8197;nm over the visible and the NIR regions. The colors could be switched for upwards of two hours with applied potential, illustrating their potential use as electroactive materials in electrochromic devices.

      <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: the Subtle Equilibrium Between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control</title>
      <dc:description>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying donor and acceptor moieties, to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly due to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, we systematically explore the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties, finding significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization and relative stability of the open form. Especially, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to red&#8208;shift the absorption while preserving cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.</dc:description>

      <title>Terpyridine based 3D Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Frameworks: A Structure&#8208;Property Correlation</title>
      <dc:description>Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system always gets importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8722;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, we intend to discuss the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines. These ligands could be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#697;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system always gets importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8722;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, we intend to discuss the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines. These ligands could be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#697;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two&#8208;pronged approach: A facile method to tether two different bioactive molecules to the [PtCl2] fragment through modified bipyridine&#8208;type ligands is described.

Abstract
A facile route to PtII complexes doubly functionalized with bioactive molecules through a bipyridine&#8208;type ligand is described. Initially, ligands LEE (containing two ethacrynic acid units), LEF (ethacrynic acid+flurbiprofen) and LEB (ethacrynic acid+biotin) were obtained in moderate to good yields from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. Subsequent reaction of the ligands with [PtCl2(DMSO)2] afforded complexes [PtCl2(LEE)] (2), [PtCl2(LEF)] (3) and [PtCl2(LEB)] (4) in high yields. All compounds were fully characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods. Complexes&#8197;2&#8211;4 are highly stable in water/DMSO solution at 37&#8201;&#176;C after 72&#8197;h, whereas progressive release of the bioactive fragments was detected in a cell culture medium. The compounds were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative activity towards tumorigenic A2780, A2780cisR and Y79 cells and non&#8208;tumourigenic HEK293 cells. In particular, the combination of ethacrynic acid and flurbiprofen in 3 overcomes cisplatin&#8208;based resistance and provides strong cancer cell selectivity. Enzyme inhibition assays on human GST P1 and human COX&#8208;2 and cross&#8208;experiments with complex&#8197;1, analogous to 2&#8211;4 but lacking bio&#8208;groups, revealed a clear synergy between the PtII frame and the bioactive organic components.

      <dc:description>
A hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronen based diaza[7]helicene was synthesized featuring a wide lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of the inner helix. This was guaranteed by hybridization with two naphthaleneimide moieties. The helical superstructure was formed as the only isomer during final Scholl oxidation with remarkable selectivity. Successful separation of the enantiomers allowed for the detailed analysis of the chemical, optical and chiroptical properties, which were supported by quantum mechanical calculations.

Dumbbell&#8208;shaped bipyridines, featuring distal steric effects of bipyridine C5&#8208; and C5&#8217;&#8208;triarylmethyl substituents, allowed controlled monochelation to transition metals. These newly synthesized ligands showed improved ligand performance compared to conventional bipyridine ligands in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and the Ni/photoredox&#8208;synergistically catalyzed decarboxylative coupling.

      <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium&#8208;Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics Using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>
      <dc:description>Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;dependent FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram&#8208;positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogs. In order to mimic the Ca2+&#8208;binding effect we uses a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp&#8208;modified DAP analogs. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several&#8208;folds active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium(III) Sensitizers and Energy Upconversion: The Influence of Ligand Structure Upon TTA&#8208;UC Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Six substituted ligands based upon 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate have been synthesized in two steps from a range of commercially available isatin derivatives. These species are demonstrated to be effective cyclometalating ligands for Ir(III) yielding complexes of the form [Ir(C^N)2(bipy)]PF6 (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; bipy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples demonstrate that the complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry wherein a cis&#8208;C,C and trans&#8208;N,N coordination mode is observed. Intra&#8208;ligand torsional distortions are evident in all cases. The Ir(III) complexes display photoluminescence in the red part of the visible region (668&#8208;693 nm) which is modestly tuneable via the ligand structure. The triplet lifetimes of the complexes are clearly influenced by the precise structure of the ligand in each case. Supporting computational (DFT) studies suggest that the differences in observed triplet lifetime are likely due to differing admixtures of ligand&#8208;centred versus MLCT character instilled by the facets of the ligand structure. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) measurements demonstrate that the complexes based upon the 1&#8208;naphthyl derived ligands are viable photosensitizers with upconversion quantum efficiencies of 1.6&#8208;6.7%.</dc:description>

      <title>A high&#8208;efficiency hematite photoanode with enhanced bonding energy around Fe atoms</title>
      <dc:description>Hematite nanoarray is an important photoanode materials. However, it suffers from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states, especially the surface states hinder the increase of photocurrent. Previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, we discover that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the keypoint to suppress the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH  4  , the Fe  2  O  3  transfers to be a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8208;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8208;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase of the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment construct a nanoscale p&#8208;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25 V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8 times). This work pinpoints the keypoint to suppress the surface states and prepare high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of the hematite photoanode.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Trifluoromethylation of Alcohols Using a Hypervalent Iodosulfoximine Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>The direct trifluoromethylation of a variety of aliphatic alcohols using a hypervalent iodosulfoximine reagent affords the corresponding ethers in moderate to good yields (14&#8208;72%). Primary, secondary and even tertiary alcohols, including examples derived from natural products, undergo this transformation in the presence of catalytic amounts of zinc bis(triflimide). Typical reaction conditions involve a neat mixture of 6.0 equivalents of the alcohol with 1.0 equivalent of the reagent, with the majority of reactions complete within 2 h with 2.5 mol&#8208;% of the Lewis acid catalyst. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that the C&#8211;O bond&#8208;forming process occurs&#160; via &#160;the coordination of the alcohol to the iodine atom and subsequent reductive elimination.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) provide opportunities for the sustainable conversion of energy from biological metabolism. Biological photovoltaics (BPVs) and microbial fuel cells (MFCs) respectively realize the conversion of renewable solar energy and bioenergy into electrical energy by utilizing electroactive biological extracellular electron transfer, however, along with this energy conversion progress, relatively poor durability and low output performance are challenges as well as opportunities. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with specific optical and electrical properties afforded by &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones are conducive to enhancing the electron generation and output capacity of electroactive organisms. In this minireview, the prominent contributions of CPs in the aspect of augmenting the photovoltaic response of BPVs and power supply of MFCs are summarized to provide inspirations for the design of bioelectronic devices in the future. For more information, see the Minireview by F. Lv and S. Wang et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15065&#8197;ff.

      <title>Isomers of B&#8592;N&#8208;Fused Dibenzo&#8208;azaacenes: How B&#8592;N Affects Opto&#8208;electronic Properties and Device Behaviors?</title>
      <dc:description>B&#8592;N unit has a large dipole and is isoelectronic to C&#8210;C moiety with no dipole. Incorporating B&#8592;N units to &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is a powerful strategy to design organic small molecules and polymers with intriguing opto&#8208;electronic properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance. However, it is unclear how B&#8592;N unit affects electronic structures and opto&#8208;electronic properties of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. In this work, to address this question, we develop three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules incorporated with two B&#8592;N units at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings. As a result, the three molecules with isomerized B&#8592;N incorporation patterns possess different electronic structures and exhibit tunable opto&#8208;electronic properties. Among the three molecules, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits higher LUMO/HOMO energy levels than those of the two axisymmetrical molecules. When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior. This work not only deepens our understanding on organoboron &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, but also indicates a new strategy to tune opto&#8208;electronic properties of organic semiconductors for excellent device performance.</dc:description>

      <title>A Calix[4]arene&#8208;Based Cyclic Dinuclear Ruthenium Complex for Light&#8208;Driven Catalytic Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Making water run up a thermodynamic hill: The thermodynamically demanding oxidation of water to molecular oxygen is a critical bottleneck for the generation of carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Homogenous light&#8208;driven water oxidation by a newly designed cyclic dinuclear Ru(bda) catalyst equipped with axial calix[4]arene ligands revealed an outstanding catalytic activity and is thus of potential interest for artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
A cyclic dinuclear ruthenium(bda) (bda: 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate) complex equipped with oligo(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized axial calix[4]arene ligands has been synthesized for homogenous catalytic water oxidation. This novel Ru(bda) macrocycle showed significantly increased catalytic activity in chemical and photocatalytic water oxidation compared to the archetype mononuclear reference [Ru(bda)(pic)2]. Kinetic investigations, including kinetic isotope effect studies, disclosed a unimolecular water nucleophilic attack mechanism of this novel dinuclear water oxidation catalyst (WOC) under the involvement of the second coordination sphere. Photocatalytic water oxidation with this cyclic dinuclear Ru complex using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as a standard photosensitizer revealed a turnover frequency of 15.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a turnover number of 460. This so far highest photocatalytic performance reported for a Ru(bda) complex underlines the potential of this water&#8208;soluble WOC for artificial photosynthesis.

      <title>Modulating the electron&#8208;donating ability of acridine donor units for orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
      <dc:description>The development of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with orange&#8208;red emission is still lagged behind their blue, green and yellow counterparts. Recent researches to address this problem mainly focused on developing new acceptor units. There were few donor units designed especially for orange&#8208;red emitters. Herein, with the benzothiophene fused to the diphenyl acridine donor unit, a new donor moiety, namely BTDPAc, was designed and synthesized. Benefited from the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of the new donor moiety, a new TADF emitter, BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI, shows an orange&#8208;red emission with its peak at 610 nm in dilute toluene solution. Also, with the help of the diphenyl rings of the donor unit, high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) were achieved for BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI at a wide concentration range. Consequently, the orange&#8208;red OLED based on BTDPAc&#8208;PhNAI achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of nearly 20%, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art device performances with similar emission spectra.</dc:description>

      <title>1,7,9,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted PMIs accessible via decarboxylative bromination: Synthesis, Characterization, Photophysical Studies and Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we present a new synthetic strategy for fourfold substituted perylene monoimides via tetrabrominated perylene monoanhydrides. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis unveiled intramolecular stacking orientation between the substituents and semicircular packing behavior. We observed remarkable influence of the substituent to the longevity and nature of the excited state upon visible light excitation. In the presence of poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymers as solubilizing template, the chromophores are capable of sensitizing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  clusters in aqueous solution for stable visible light driven hydrogen evolution over three days.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we present a new synthetic strategy for fourfold substituted perylene monoimides via tetrabrominated perylene monoanhydrides. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis unveiled intramolecular stacking orientation between the substituents and semicircular packing behavior. We observed remarkable influence of the substituent to the longevity and nature of the excited state upon visible light excitation. In the presence of poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymers as solubilizing template, the chromophores are capable of sensitizing [Mo  3  S  13  ]  2&#8208;  clusters in aqueous solution for stable visible light driven hydrogen evolution over three days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Domino Fusion of an Organic ligand Depended on Metal&#8208;Induced and Oxygen Insertion, Unraveled by Crystallography, Mass Spectrometry and DFT Calculation</title>
      <dc:description>Here, we report the reaction, CH  3  CN at 120 &#176;C, of (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanamine (  L1  ) with Co(H  2  O)  6  Cl  2  leading to the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazine (  3  ), isolated as a dimeric cluster {[Co  II  2  (  3  )Cl  4  ]&#8729;2CH  3  CN} (  2  ). When O  2  and H  2  O are present, (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)amide (  HL1'  ) is first formed and crystallized as [Co  III  (  L1  )  2  (  L1'  )]Cl  2  &#8729;2H  2  O (  4  ) before fusion of H  L1'  with  L1  giving 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (  HL2''  ) forming one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of [Co  II  3  (  L2''  )  2  Cl  4  ]  n  (  5  ). The combination of crystallography and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) of isolated crystals and the solutions taken from the reaction as a function time reveal seven intermediate steps leading to  2  , but six steps for  5  which a different sequence takes place. Control and isotope labeling experiments confirm the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in  5  originate from both air and water. The dependence on the metals, compared to FeCl  3  &#183;6H  2  O leading to a stable triheteroarylmethyl radical, is quite astounding, which could be attributed to the different oxidation states of the metals and coordination modes confirmed by DFT calculations. This metal and valence dependent process is a very useful way for selectively obtaining these large molecules which are unachievable by common organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The combination of 2D materials opens a wide range of possibilities to create new generation structures with multiple applications. Covalently cross&#8208;linked approaches are a ground&#8208;breaking strategy for the formation of homo or heterostructures made by design.

      <title>Understanding the C&#8211;F Bond Activation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Crucial Role of Noncovalent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>The activation of a single C&#8211;F bond in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has been computationally explored by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. It is found that in this activation reaction the FLP partners exhibit a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where noncovalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role. In addition, the process proceeds through the intermediacy of a hypervalent species featuring a pentacoordinate carbon atom, which is rare in the chemistry of FLPs. The physical factors controlling this process as well as the bonding situation of these hypervalent intermediates have been quantitatively analyzed in detail using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods to not only rationalize the mechanism of the transformation but also to guide experimentalists towards the realization of these so far elusive hypervalent systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic ion speciation during hydrolysis of aryltrifluoroborates</title>
      <dc:description>Organotrifluoroborates serve as a coupling partner during transmetallation in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction but require hydrolysis prior to the coupling reaction. Their anionic nature allows study of their hydrolysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) by real&#8208;time monitoring, complemented by pH analysis. Induction periods varied according to the borates employed, and a dynamic series of equilibria for numerous ions was observed during hydrolysis.

      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging present a promising avenue to image hypoxia. Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents have a unique biologically relevant redox couple, Eu  II/III  , that distinguishes this metal for use in hypoxia imaging. To that end, we investigated a strategy to enhance the contrast&#8208;enhancing capabilities of Eu  II  &#8208;based cryptates in magnetic resonance imaging by controlling rotational dynamics. Two dimetallic, Eu  II  &#8208;containing cryptates were synthesized to test the efficacy of rigid versus flexible coupling strategies. A flexible strategy to dimerization led to a modest (114%) increase in contrast enhancement per Eu ion (60 MHz, 298 K), but a rigid linking strategy led to an excellent (186%) increase in contrast enhancement despite having the smaller molecular mass of the two dimetallic complexes. We envision the rigid linking strategy to be useful in the future design of potent Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>An Anthracene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Photo&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formic Acid Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broadband visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. We have obtained formic acid as the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a TOF of 0.69 h  &#8208;1  and oxygen with a TOF of 0.54 h  &#8208;1  . No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. So, here we have illustrated efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr&#8208;based MOF as catalyst.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broadband visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. We have obtained formic acid as the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a TOF of 0.69 h  &#8208;1  and oxygen with a TOF of 0.54 h  &#8208;1  . No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. So, here we have illustrated efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr&#8208;based MOF as catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Effect of Stereochemistry on the Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Chirality and Gelation Property</title>
      <dc:description>Although chiral nanostructures have been fabricated at various structural levels, the transfer and amplification of chirality from molecules to supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are still puzzling, especially for heterochiral molecules. Herein, four series of C2&#8208;symmetrical dipeptide&#8208;based derivatives bearing various amino acid sequences and different chiralities are designed and synthesized.  The transcription and amplification of molecular chirality to supramolecular assemblies are achieved. The results show that the supramolecular chirality is only determined by the amino acid adjacent to the benzene core and irrespective of the absolute configuration of C&#8208;terminal amino acid.  In addition, the molecular chirality also has a significant influence on their gelation behaviors. For the diphenylalanine&#8208;based gelators, the homochiral gelators can be gelled through conventional heating&#8208;cooling process, while heterochiral gelators form translucent stable gels under sonication. And the racemic gels possess higher mechanical properties than that of pure enantiomers. All these results contribute to an increasing knowledge over control the generation of specific chiral supramolecular structures and the development of new optimized strategies to achieve functional supramolecular organogel through heterochiral and racemic systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical properties of aromatic hydrocarbons having one and two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  . The mono&#8208; (  1  ) and di&#8208;boryl compounds (  2  ) readily prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction are fairly stable to air and moisture in the solid&#8208;state. The inserted ethynediyl (C &#8801;C) spacer cancels steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective&#160; &#960; &#8208;conjugation over the B &#8208; C &#8801; C &#8208;Ar linkages as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. Despite the small structural differences, photophysical properties of the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives were different. Virtually no emission was observed for the benzene derivatives, whereas the anthracene derivatives emitted with high quantum yields both in solution and solid states. Notably, the naphthalene derivatives showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Unlike common sterically congested triarylborane derivatives reported so far, the anthracene derivatives showed&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; * type absorption and emission bands, which derived from the efficient intramolecular orbital interactions between the boron centers and the anthracene moieties as supported by the density functional calculations. As a result, the dimesitylborylethynyl substituents effectively lowers the LUMO levels of the aromatic hydrocarbon parts while the HOMO levels are almost unaffected, leading to materials with controllable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of a pyrimidine&#8208;dione derivative with potent inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase</title>
      <dc:description>New drugs aimed at novel targets are urgently needed to combat the increasing rate of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). Here, the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI&#8208;DTP) chemical library was screened against a promising new target, ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway. From this library, 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylthiazolo[4,5&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine&#8208;5,7(4  H  ,6  H  )&#8208;dione (NSC116565) was identified as a potent time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (  Mt  ) KARI with a K  i  of 95.4 nM. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies showed that this inhibitor binds to Mt KARI in the presence and absence of the co&#8208;factor, NADPH, which was confirmed by crystal structures of the compound in complex with the closely related Staphylococcus aureus (  Sa  ) KARI. We have also shown that NSC116565 inhibits the growth of H37Ra and H37Rv strains of Mt with MIC  50  values of 2.93 &#181;M and 6.06 &#181;M, respectively. These results further validate KARI as a TB drug target and show that NSC116565 is a promising lead for anti&#8208;TB drug development.</dc:description>

      <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we developed a quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20 &#176;C. Analysis with the linear&#8208;free energy relationship lg  K  B  =  LA  B  +  LB  B  allows to calculate equilibrium constants  K  B  for any type of borane/Lewis base combination by the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (  LA  B  ) and one for Lewis basicity (  LB  B  ). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid toward various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. We demonstrate that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8208;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;  H  BF3  ). Furthermore, we show that this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>How does bridging core modification alter the photovoltaic characteristics of triphenylamine&#8208;based hole transport materials? Theoretical understanding and prediction</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest of researchers owing to their high photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCE), and long length diffusion of hole and electron in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of &#960;&#8208;linkers is proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells. In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of recently synthesized H&#8208;Bi molecule (  R  ) is done with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (  HB1&#8208;HB10  ) having D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D backbone have been obtained. Structural&#8208;property relationship, optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of newly designed hole transport materials are comprehensively examined and compared with reference molecule. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with assist of density functional theory and time dependent&#8208;density functional theory. All designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (E  g  =2.82&#8208;2.99 eV) as compared to R molecule (E  g  =3.05 eV). Designed molecules expressed red&#8208;shifting in absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies.&#160;Results of all analysis advocate that these novel designed HTMs are ideal aspirant for construction of future high performance perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Doubling F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications to Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>Designing potential protein&#8208;ligand pair is pivotal not only to track protein structure, dynamics but also to assist in atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Here we report the potentiality of a small model thioamide probe that can be used to study albumin proteins. Monitoring F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, we observed two&#8208;fold enhancement in the FRET efficiency in the case of 2&#8208;Thiopyridone (2TPY) compared to its amide analog. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation depicts the relative position of the free energy minima to be quite stable in case of 2TPY via non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur which helps for enhancement in the FRET efficiency. Finally, we showed its application by pairing thiouracils with protein. We found that site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency which can be a potential avenue to explore for designing FRET probes to study structure and dynamics of biomolecules.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD) is one of the most common multifactorial diseases characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. Herein, we investigate the effect of Cu(II) ions on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;40, and A&#946;4&#8208;40, representing two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, full length and N&#8208;truncated ones. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains. In either of the studied peptides, substoichiometric Cu(II) concentrations accelerated aggregation, while superstoichiometric Cu(II) inhibited the fibril formation, likely by stabilizing oligomers. The addition of either A&#946;4&#8208;40 or substoichiometric Cu(II) ions affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8208;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase of positive charge at the A&#946; N&#8208;terminus, which is caused either by Cu(II) complexation or N&#8208;truncation at position 4.

      <title>Chemodivergence Between Electrophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Chemodivergent cross&#8208;couplings are those in which either one of two (or more) potentially reactive functional groups can be made to react based on choice of conditions. In particular, this review focuses on cross&#8208;couplings involving two different (pseudo)halides that can compete for the role of the electrophilic coupling partner. The discussion is primarily organized by pairs of electrophiles including chloride vs. triflate, bromide vs. triflate, chloride vs. tosylate, and halide vs. halide. Some common themes emerge regarding the origin of selectivity control. These include catalyst ligation state and solvent polarity or coordinating ability. However, in many cases, further systematic studies will be necessary to deconvolute the influences of metal identity, ligand, solvent, additives, nucleophilic coupling partner, and other factors on chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>In Vitro and In Vivo Sequestration of Phencyclidine by Me4Cucurbit[8]uril</title>
      <dc:description>We report investigations of the use of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) macrocycles as an

antidote to counteract the in vivo biological effects of phencyclidine. We investigate the binding

of CB[8] and its derivative Me4CB[8] toward ten drugs of abuse (3 &#8211; 9, 12 &#8211;14) by a combination

of 1H NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry in phosphate buffered water. We

find that the cavity of CB[8] and Me4CB[8] are able to encapsulate the 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclohexane

ring system of phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine as well as the morphinan skeleton

of morphine and hydromorphone with Kd values &#8804; 50 nM. In vitro cytotoxicity (MTS metabolic

and adenylate kinase cell death assays in HEK293 and HEPG2 cells) and in vivo maximum

tolerated dose studies (Swiss Webster mice) which were performed for Me4CB[8] indicated good

tolerability. The tightest host&#8226;guest pair (Me4CB[8]&#8226;PCP; Kd = 2 nM) was advanced to in vivo

efficacy studies. The results of open field tests demonstrate that pretreatment of mice with

Me4CB[8] prevents subsequent hyperlocomotion induction by PCP and also that treatment of

animals previously dosed with PCP with Me4CB[8] significantly reduces the locomotion levels.</dc:description>

Gradual phase transitions were observed for  1  and  2  by DSC and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) at approximately 225 K.

      <title>(o&#8208;Phenylenediamino)borylstannanes: Efficient Reagents for Borylation of Various Alkyl Radical Precursors</title>
      <dc:description>(o&#8208;Phenylenediamino)borylstannanes were newly synthesized to achieve radical boryl substitutions of a variety of alkyl radical precursors. Dehalogenative, deaminative, decharcogenative, and decarboxylative borylations proceeded in the presence of a radical initiator to give the corresponding organic boron compounds. Radical clock experiments and computational studies have provided insights into the mechanism of the SH2 (homolytic substitution) of the borylstannanes with alkyl radical intermediates. DFT calculation disclosed that the phenylenediamino structure lowered the LUMO level including the vacant p&#8208;orbital on the boron atom to enhance the reactivity to alkyl radicals in SH2. Moreover, C(sp3)&#8208;H borylation of THF was accomplished using the triplet state of xanthone.</dc:description>

Radical clock experiments and computational studies have provided insights into the mechanism of the SH2 (homolytic substitution) of the borylstannanes with alkyl radical intermediates. DFT calculation disclosed that the phenylenediamino structure lowered the LUMO level including the vacant p&#8208;orbital on the boron atom to enhance the reactivity to alkyl radicals in SH2. Moreover, C(sp3)&#8208;H borylation of THF was accomplished using the triplet state of xanthone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Novel Thermocell System Using Large Solvation Entropy of Proton</title>
      <dc:description>The entropy change associated with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient (  S  e  ) of thermocells. A redox pair of [Ru(H  x  im)  6  ]  2+/3+  (Him = imidazole, x = 0~1) releases three protons in their one&#8208;electron redox reactions in thermocells, which gave a remarkably high  S  e  of &#8722;3.7 mV K  &#8722;1  as confirmed by temperature&#8208;dependent square wave voltammetry. The value of  S  e  is proportional to the redox reaction entropy (  &#916;S  rc  ), which increased with the number of dissociating protons. This result demonstrates the utility of PCET reaction toward efficient thermoelectric conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Preparation of a Lanthanide&#8722;Titanium Oxo Cluster&#8722;Polymer Composite via Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed Click Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Incorporating metal clusters within the skeleton of the organic polymers through click reaction can not only effectively prepare cluster&#8722;polymer composites, but also effectively avoid the cluster aggregation. Herein, an azide&#8208;contatining Lanthanide&#8722;Titanium oxo cluster of  Eu  8  Ti  10  &#8208;N  3  (  Eu  8  Ti  10  &#8208;N  3  = [Eu  8  Ti  10  (  &#181;  3  &#8208;O)  14  (H  2  O)  4  (OAc)  2  (tbba)  30  (paza)  4  (THF)  2  ]&#8226;4THF&#8226;8H  2  O (  1  ), Htbba = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzoic acid, Hpaza = 4&#8208;azidobenzoate, HOAc = acetic acid, THF = Tetrahydrofuran) through  in situ  solvothermal reaction of 4&#8208;Azidobenzoic acid and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzoic acid. Reaction of  1  with  PEG  (  PEG  = Methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol)alkyne, 2000 g/mol) through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed click chemistry generates a lanthanide&#8722;polymer composite of  Eu  8  Ti  10  &#8208;N  3  @PEG  (  2  ). Investigation on IR,  1  H NMR ICP&#8208;OES of  2  indicates that the structural integrity of  1  is maintained in  2  . Study on luminescent properties of  1  and  2  reveals that the quantum yield of  1  itself basically keeps unchanged in  2  . Significantly, the formation of  2  can not only effectively prevent the cluster  1  from aggregation, but also greatly enhance its solubility and adhesion to the substrate. Owing to the solubility and adhesion of luminescent materials being the key to their practical application, present work is thus of great significance for the development of metal cluster&#8208;polymer composite luminescent materials.</dc:description>

Herein, an azide&#8208;contatining Lanthanide&#8722;Titanium oxo cluster of  Eu  8  Ti  10  &#8208;N  3  (  Eu  8  Ti  10  &#8208;N  3  = [Eu  8  Ti  10  (  &#181;  3  &#8208;O)  14  (H  2  O)  4  (OAc)  2  (tbba)  30  (paza)  4  (THF)  2  ]&#8226;4THF&#8226;8H  2  O (  1  ), Htbba = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzoic acid, Hpaza = 4&#8208;azidobenzoate, HOAc = acetic acid, THF = Tetrahydrofuran) through  in situ  solvothermal reaction of 4&#8208;Azidobenzoic acid and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzoic acid. Reaction of  1  with  PEG  (  PEG  = Methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol)alkyne, 2000 g/mol) through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed click chemistry generates a lanthanide&#8722;polymer composite of  Eu  8  Ti  10  &#8208;N  3  @PEG  (  2  ). Investigation on IR,  1  H NMR ICP&#8208;OES of  2  indicates that the structural integrity of  1  is maintained in  2  . Study on luminescent properties of  1  and  2  reveals that the quantum yield of  1  itself basically keeps unchanged in  2  . Significantly, the formation of  2  can not only effectively prevent the cluster  1  from aggregation, but also greatly enhance its solubility and adhesion to the substrate. Owing to the solubility and adhesion of luminescent materials being the key to their practical application, present work is thus of great significance for the development of metal cluster&#8208;polymer composite luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
