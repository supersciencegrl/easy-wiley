         <title>Computational Insights on Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Feature of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is currently continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of S protein. The binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes of Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2' were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was significantly higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation on Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth,  d  10  electron configuration, and 6s  2  lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework  from AEB  4  O  6  F  2  (AE = Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, M  II  B  4  O  6  F  2  (M  II  = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (  route&#8208;I  ), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB  4  O  6  F  2  structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146 nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064 nm  ,  and the PbB  4  O  6  F  2  structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194 nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064 nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;Chiral Concave Complexes: Aggregation and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;symmetric complexes bearing triphenyl (1) and trialkyl phosphine ligands (2 and 3) were synthesized and studied. In CHCl3/MeOH mixtures 1 and 2 showed an AIE effect at 540&#8197;nm, probably originating from aurophilic interactions. 3 showed AIE only in nearly pure MeOH and in the solid state. The aggregation of optically pure 1 started at lower MeOH content than (&#177;)&#8208;1, indicating that the latter gave racemates rather than conglomerates.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I) acetylide trinuclear complexes 1&#8211;3 based on the cyclotribenzylene platform and terminal PR3 ligands (R=Ph, Et, and Cy, respectively), were characterized and their light emission studied. They exhibited long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence in CHCl3 and a weak fluorescence in the UV. In MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures of &gt;1:1 volume ratio, 1 and 2 exhibited a new emission band at ca. 540&#8197;nm that developed at the expense of the UV emission. DLS studies demonstrated the presence of molecular aggregates of &#216; 30&#8211;80&#8197;nm. The green emission observed in MeOH&#8208;rich solvent mixtures was therefore induced by aggregation, and could originate from Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The AIE spectrum of 3 was observed only in solutions containing 99&#8201;% of MeOH, and correlated with its solid state emission. The AIE profiles of the enantiomers of 1 differed from that of rac&#8208;1, suggesting that the latter is a true racemate.

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of SAPO&#8208;34 Molecular Sieves</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the conventional: SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves have excellent form selection and controllability in the chemical industry, as well as being one of the best industrial catalysts for converting methanol to olefin. The synthesis methods and applications of conventional, hierarchical, and nanosized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are introduced in this review, and the advantages and shortcomings of each synthesis method are compared, along with their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance.







Abstract
Silicoaluminophosphate zeolite (SAPO&#8208;34) has been attracting increasing attention due to its excellent form selection and controllability in the chemical industry, as well as being one of the best industrial catalysts for methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reaction conversion. However, as a microporous molecular sieve, SAPO&#8208;34 easily generates carbon deposition and rapidly becomes inactivated. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the crystal size of the zeolite or to introduce secondary macropores into the zeolite crystal to form a hierarchical structure in order to improve the catalytic effect. In this review, the synthesis methods of conventional SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves, hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves and nanosized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are introduced, and the properties of the synthesized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves are described, including the phase, morphology, pore structure, acid source, and catalytic performance, in particular with respect to the synthesis of hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves. We hope that the review can provide guidance to the preparation of the SAPO&#8208;34 catalysts, and stimulate the future development of high&#8208;performance hierarchical SAPO&#8208;34 catalysts to meet the growing demands of the material and chemical industries.

&lt;p&gt;Silicoaluminophosphate zeolite (SAPO-34) has been attracting increasing attention due to its excellent form selection and controllability in the chemical industry, as well as being one of the best industrial catalysts for methanol-to-olefin (MTO) reaction conversion. However, as a microporous molecular sieve, SAPO-34 easily generates carbon deposition and rapidly becomes inactivated. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the crystal size of the zeolite or to introduce secondary macropores into the zeolite crystal to form a hierarchical structure in order to improve the catalytic effect. In this review, the synthesis methods of conventional SAPO-34 molecular sieves, hierarchical SAPO-34 molecular sieves and nanosized SAPO-34 molecular sieves are introduced, and the properties of the synthesized SAPO-34 molecular sieves are described, including the phase, morphology, pore structure, acid source, and catalytic performance, in particular with respect to the synthesis of hierarchical SAPO-34 molecular sieves. We hope that the review can provide guidance to the preparation of the SAPO-34 catalysts, and stimulate the future development of high-performance hierarchical SAPO-34 catalysts to meet the growing demands of the material and chemical industries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanostructured Manganese Oxides within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate Exhibiting Unusual Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively, were synthesized inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate cavity, and Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the aerobic oxygenation of alkylarenes through a unique reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nanosized manganese oxides have recently received considerable attention for their synthesis, structures, and potential applications. Although various synthetic methods have been developed, precise synthesis of novel nanostructured manganese oxides are still challenging. In this study, using a structurally defined nanosized cavity inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides, Mn18 and Mn20, respectively. In particular, Mn18 showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the oxygenation of alkylarenes including electron&#8208;deficient ones, and the reaction proceeded through a unique reaction mechanism due to its unusual manganese oxide structure.

         <title>BBr3&#8208;Mediated P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Borylation of Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron Chemistry. An efficient metal&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines directed by P(III) atom just using BBr3. This robust method enables the rapid construction of phosphine boronate esters in selective, practical, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly modes.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation has been widely used in the preparation of organoboron compounds. Here, we developed a general protocol on metal&#8208;free P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines mediated by BBr3, resulting in the formation of products bearing both phosphorus and boron. The development of the metal&#8208;free strategy to mimic previous metallic processes has shown low cost, superior practicality, and environmental friendliness. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the preferred pathway for this metal&#8208;free directed C&#8722;H borylation process.

         <title>Understanding the Influence of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diazo Compounds on the Catalyst Efficiency of B(C6F5)3 Towards Carbene Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Diazo compounds have been largely used for carbene transfer reactions in a variety of functionalization reactions. Recently, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C  6  F  5  )  3  ] has been shown to be an efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst for carbene transfer reactions. Herein, we report a  Density Functional Theory  (DFT) study on the generation of carbene species from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds using catalytic amounts of B(C  6  F  5  )  3  . We observe that the efficiency of the catalyst depends directly on the nature of the substituents on both the aryl ring and the carbonyl group of the substrate. In some cases, we observe that the boron catalyst has negligible effect on the ease of the carbene formation, while in other cases there is a dramatic reduction in the activation energy of the reaction. This direct dependence is not commonly observed in catalysis and our finding opens the way for intelligent design of this and other similar catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>C(spn)&#8211;X (n = 1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X&#160;bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH  3  , Cl) in archetypal model substrates H  3  C&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;X, H  2  C=CH&#8211;X and HC&#8801;C&#8211;X by catalysts PdL  n  &#160;with L  n  &#160;= no ligand, Cl  &#8211;  , and (PH  3  )  2  , using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases&#160;going from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  2  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from&#160;  sp  3  &#160;to&#160;  sp  2  &#160;to&#160;  sp  , originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X, which goes from four, to three, to two&#160;along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X&#160;to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Lewis Acidity of Boronic Acids through Interactions with Arene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids, specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8211;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism&#160;of cyclopentane: an&#160;experimental&#160;and theoretical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by analogy comparison&#160;with non&#8208;cyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and non&#8208;cycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy is not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8208;3 atm&#160;and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 K and 800&#160;K. The low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, highly oxygenated intermediates (e.g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of&#160;the oxidation of CPT, the electronic structure calculations at the&#160;UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p)&#160;level&#160;were carried out to explore the reactivity of O2&#160;molecules adding sequentially&#160;to cyclopentyl radicals.&#160;Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2&#160;is HO2&#160;elimination, yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2&#160;addition, the dissociation of hydroperoxide were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new series of lanthanide (  1&#8208;5  ) and uranyl (  6  ) complexes with a tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand  H  2  L  is described.

Ligand interactions with lanthanide cations (light: La  3+  , Pr  3+  ; intermediate: Eu  3+  and Gd  3+  ; and heavy: Yb  3+  ), as well as the uranyl cation (UO  2  2+  ) is examined in the solution and solid state, respectively with spectrophotometric titration and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The ligand is fully deprotonated in the complexation of trivalent lanthanide ions forming di&#8208;cationic complexes 2:2 M:  L  , [Ln  2  (  L  )  2  (H  2  O)]  2+  (  1  &#8208;  5  ), in solution, whereas uranyl formed a 1:1 M:  L  complex [UO  2  (  L  )(MeOH)]  &#8734;  (  6  ) that demonstrated very limited solubility in 12 organic solvents. Solvent extraction behaviour is examined for cation selectivity and extraction efficiency.  H  2  L  was found to be an effective extracting agent for UO  2  2+  over La  3+  and Yb  3+  cations. The separation factors at pH 6.0 are: [[EQUATION]] = 121.0 and [[EQUATION]] = 70.0.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Channel Engineering for Rapid Ion Transport: From Nature to Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by rapid and selective ion transport behaviours commonly identified in biological systems, ion transport properties in solid and liquid crystals are crucial for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, including electrode materials and electrolytes, which are critically reviewed and summarized. It is expected that this review could provide some new design principles for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries based on this understanding of natural ion transport phenomena.







Abstract
Ion transport behaviours through cell membranes are commonly identified in biological systems, which are crucial for sustaining life for organisms. Similarly, ion transport is significant for electrochemical ion storage in rechargeable batteries, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Rapid ion transport can be well achieved by crystal channels engineering, such as creating pores or tailoring interlayer spacing down to the nanometre or even sub&#8208;nanometre scale. Furthermore, some functional channels, such as ion selective channels and stimulus&#8208;responsive channels, are developed for smart ion storage applications. In this review, the typical ion transport phenomena in the biological systems, including ion channels and pumps, are first introduced, and then ion transport mechanisms in solid and liquid crystals are comprehensively reviewed, particularly for the widely studied porous inorganic/organic hybrid crystals and ultrathin inorganic materials. Subsequently, recent progress on the ion transport properties in electrodes and electrolytes is reviewed for rechargeable batteries. Finally, current challenges in the ion transport behaviours in rechargeable batteries are analysed and some potential research approaches, such as bioinspired ultrafast ion transport structures and membranes, are proposed for future studies. It is expected that this review can give a comprehensive understanding on the ion transport mechanisms within crystals and provide some novel design concepts on promoting electrochemical ion storage capability in rechargeable batteries.

Controlling the hydrogen reduction of molybdenum trioxide to molybdenum dioxide and eventually metallic molybdenum with desirable morphology is a topic of continual scientific interest. Herein, this work presents a method of forming a wide range of grain sizes of the crucial molybdenum dioxide intermediary product by the adjustment of parameters such as temperature, water content and potassium content, further elucidating this first reduction step.







Abstract
During the reduction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) to metallic molybdenum, the first reduction step yielding molybdenum dioxide as an intermediary product is of crucial importance. In this study, we examined the impact of the parameters reduction temperature, water influx, and potassium content on the hydrogen reduction of this first reaction step. Beginning from the same starting material, the chemical vapor transport mechanism was utilized to yield the phase pure MoO2. Analyses including powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and high performance optical microscopy were performed on the product phases. Modulations of the specific surface areas of molybdenum dioxide ranging from 2.28 to 0.41&#8197;m2/g were possible. Furthermore, a distinct shift from small plate&#8208;like grains to cuboid&#8208;like forms was achieved.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Direct Oxidation of Primary Amines to Carboxylic Acids through Tandem ortho&#8208;Naphthoquinone&#8208;Catalyzed and TBHP&#8208;Promoted Oxidation Sequence</title>

         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation sequence of amines to carboxylic acids is developed through the o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation of amines to imines followed by the radical&#8208;initiated TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine intermediates. Mechanistically, the selective imine formation by o&#8208;NQ catalyst system is facilitated by the assistance of TBAI, also critical in the following TBHP&#8208;promoted oxidation of imine derivatives to break down the imines to aldehydes and amines. In turn, the released amines re&#8208;enter into the o&#8208;NQ catalytic cycle to produce the imine intermediates.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidation of primary amines to carboxylic acids has been developed where the copper&#8208;containing amine oxidase (CuAO)&#8208;like o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation was combined with the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)&#8208;like TBHP&#8208;mediated imine oxidation protocol. Notably, the current tandem oxidation strategy provides a new mechanistic insight into the imine intermediate and the seemingly simple TBHP&#8208;mediated oxidation pathways of imines. The developed metal&#8208;free amine oxidation protocol allows the use of molecular oxygen and TBHP, safe forms of oxidant that may appeal to the industrial application.

The reaction of [(NacnacNi)2tol] with white phosphorus, yellow arsenic and the interpnictogen compound AsP3 leads in dependence of the temperature to different complexes ([(NacnacNi)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] and the paramagnetic [(NacnacNi)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P, As)). The reduction was performed with KC8 and leads to similar but also different structured products. Thus, a large variety of different polypnictogen units are formed coordinated by nickel nacnac complexes.







Abstract
The reactivity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic towards two different nickel nacnac complexes is investigated. The nickel complexes [(L1Ni)2tol] (1, L1=[{N(C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6)C(Me)}2CH]&#8722;) and [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;N2)] (6) were reacted with P4, As4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, respectively, yielding the homobimetallic complexes [(L1Ni)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2,&#954;1:&#951;2,&#954;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (2&#8201;a), As (2&#8201;b), AsP3 (2&#8201;c)), [(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (3&#8201;a), As (3&#8201;b)) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)2][L1Ni(&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)), respectively. Heating of 2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b or 2&#8201;c also leads to the formation of 3&#8201;a or 3&#8201;b. Furthermore, the reactivity of these compounds towards reduction agents was investigated, leading to [K2][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P4)] (4) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)3][(L1Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (5&#8201;a), As (5&#8201;b)), respectively. Compound 4 shows an unusual planarization of the initial Ni2P4&#8208;prism. All products were comprehensively characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods.

Simple indole&#8208;based merocyanines have been successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors for organic solar cells by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure that have a facile synthesis, enhanced photostability compared to well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor, and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%.







Abstract
Merocyanine (MC) dyes exhibit facile synthesis and attractive optical properties, making them widely studied as the donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, for the first time, simple indole&#8208;based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to the well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of the dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>

         <dc:description>
The orbital and the density, hand in hand: Three perspectives for conceptualizing chemical bonding are connected here within one framework: experimental quantum chemistry. A new definition for atoms inside molecules leads to quantification of atomic energy, partial charge, and in&#8208;situ electronegativity. Predictions follow, of pKa, of electronegativity inversions in polar bonds, and of hydrogen stabilization&#8208;driven electron&#8208;deficient bonding in diborane.







Abstract
One challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum&#8208;mechanical framework that enables a combination of ideas from three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: energy decomposition analysis (EDA), quantum chemical topology, and molecular orbital (MO) theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one part electrons and one part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. The formation of polar bonds is predicted to cause inversion of electronegativity, and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8722;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. The electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of pKa.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Drug&#8208;Like Benzoic Acids: Access to Anilines and Drug Conjugates through Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

Added at the eleventh hour: A method for the late&#8208;stage directed amination of benzoic acids is presented. It allows rapid access to both small amino&#8208;functionalized analogues and large conjugates, including PROTACs, peptide conjugates and probes for chemical biology. Selection of the right catalyst and reagent enabled the use of high&#8208;throughput experimentation and automation.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with the potential to streamline the drug&#8208;discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond&#8211;forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The method presented herein enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug&#8208;delivery conjugates, PROTACs, and probes for chemical biology. This rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid and considerably accelerate drug discovery.

         <title>Predictive Catalysis in Olefin Metathesis with Ru&#8208;based Catalysts with Annulated C60 Fullerenes in the N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

Annulating C60 fullerenes in NHC ligands enhances the catalysis of Ru&#8208;based olefin metathesis catalysis.







Abstract
Predictive catalysis must be the tool that does not replace experiments, but acts as a selective agent, so that synthetic strategies of maximum profitability are used in the laboratory in a surgical way. Here, nanotechnology has been used in olefin metathesis from homogeneous Ru&#8208;NHC catalysts, specifically annulating a C60 fullerene to the NHC ligand. Based on results with the C60 in the backbone, a sterile change with respect to the catalysis of the metal center, an attempt has been made to bring C60 closer to the metal, by attaching it to one of the two C&#8722;N bonds of the imidazole group of the SIMes (1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) ligand (reference NHC ligand of the 2nd generation Grubbs catalysts) to increase the steric pressure of C60 in the first sphere of reactivity of the metal. The DFT calculated thermodynamics and the kinetics of SIMes&#8208;derived systems show that they are efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis.

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN Peptide Complexes Increases ROS Levels, DNA Cleavage and Antiproliferative Activity**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18093-18102, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of reactive oxygen species was achieved with a redox&#8208;silent Cu(II) ATCUN complex by replacing the &#945;&#8208;amino acid glycine with &#946;&#8208;alanine. Increased ROS production led to higher oxidative DNA cleavage activity. The reasons for this higher activity were elucidated via potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, UV/VIS spectroscopy and DFT. In cytotoxicity assays, &#946;&#8208;alanine peptide complexes showed lower IC50 values in several cancer cell lines compared with the glycine analogs, which could be correlated with the amounts of Cu taken up by cells.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et&#8197;al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore leads to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2&#8594;&#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production (&#8226;OH and H2O2). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.

A series of isostructural actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren) reveal different An&#8722;Nimine vs. An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths and covalent character of the An&#8722;N bonds. Comparison to the [An(salen)2] complexes displays a slightly weaker overall bond strength of pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu), except for PaIV.







Abstract
We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with the N&#8208;donor ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren). Structural data from SC&#8208;XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)2] complexes with different An&#8722;Nimine versus An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths. Quantum chemical calculations elucidated the bonding situation, including differences in the covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous N,N&#8242;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis(salicylideneimine) (H2salen)&#8208;based complexes [An(salen)2] displays, on average, almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the AnIV, pointing to a potential ligand&#8208;cage&#8208;driven complex stabilisation. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective AnIV complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure N&#8208;donor ligand pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker than to salen, with the exception of the PaIV complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with PaIV. Such an altered ligand preference within the early AnIV series points to a specificity of the 5f1 configuration, which can be explained by polarisation effects of the 5&#8201;f electrons, allowing the strongest f electron backbonding from PaIV (5f1) to the N donors of pyren.

         <title>Coordinatively Unsaturated Amidotitanocene Cations with Inverted &#963; and &#960; Bond Strengths: Controlled Release of Aminyl Radicals and Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18175-18187, December 23, 2021. </description>

Amidotitanocene cations serve as versatile, &#8220;bottlable&#8221; precursors for a range of highly reactive species such as aminyl radicals, and active catalysts for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions. Their catalytic performance in amine&#8208;silane dehydrocoupling is the highest recorded so far for an earth&#8208;abundant metal (TON up to 3960). The Ti&#8722;N interaction displays reversed &#963; and &#960; bond strengths, as shown by EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations.







Abstract
Cationic amidotitanocene complexes [Cp2Ti(NPhAr)][B(C6F5)4] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; Ar=phenyl (1&#8201;a), p&#8208;tolyl (1&#8201;b), p&#8208;anisyl (1&#8201;c)) were isolated. The bonding situation was studied by DFT (Density Functional Theory) using EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence). The polar Ti&#8722;N bond in 1&#8201;a&#8211;c features an unusual inversion of &#963; and &#960; bond strengths responsible for the balance between stability and reactivity in these coordinatively unsaturated species. In solution, 1&#8201;a&#8211;c undergo photolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to release Ti(III) species and aminyl radicals &#8901;NPhAr. Reaction of 1&#8201;b with H3BNHMe2 results in fast homolytic Ti&#8722;N cleavage to give [Cp2Ti(H3BNHMe2)][B(C6F5)4] (3). 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are highly active precatalysts in olefin hydrogenation and silanes/amines cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling, whilst 3 efficiently catalyzes amine&#8208;borane dehydrogenation. The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation was studied by DFT and the cooperative H2 activation key step was disclosed using the Activation Strain Model (ASM).

Mediated synthesis: A strategy for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones using visible light and two carboxylic acid&#8208;derived substrates is presented. No expensive iridium catalysts are required, with eco&#8208;friendly Hantzsch ester acting as both the photosensitizer and photoreductant. A broad scope of synthesized ketones is presented along with spectroscopical and computational studies of the role of the different reactants.







Abstract
A simple visible light photochemical, nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acid&#8208;derived precursors is presented. Hantzsch ester (HE) functions as a cheap, green and strong photoreductant to facilitate radical generation and also engages in the Ni&#8208;catalytic cycle to restore the reactive species. With this dual role, HE allows for the coupling of a large variety of radicals (1&#176;,2&#176;, benzylic, &#945;&#8208;oxy &amp; &#945;&#8208;amino) with aroyl and alkanoyl moieties, a new feature in reactions of this type. With both precursors deriving from abundant carboxylic acids, this protocol is a welcome addition to the organic chemistry toolbox. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions without the need for toxic metal reagents or bases and shows a wide scope, including pharmaceuticals and complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large Pore, Large Pore and Medium Pore Zeolites Using a Small Imidazolium Cation as the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18109-18117, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a small&#8208;sized imidazolium cation of facile synthesis as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent, three germanosilicate zeolites with extra&#8208;large, large and medium pores were synthesized. For the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore zeolite &#8208;SYT, the location of the organic cations was studied by molecular simulations, confirmed by Rietveld refinement and compared to that reported for the original, sophisticated and expensive &#8208;SYT cation.







Abstract
One common strategy in the search for new zeolites is the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDA). Typically, one seeks to achieve a high specificity in the structure&#8208;directing effect of the OSDA. This study shows, however, that an OSDA lacking strong specificity towards any particular zeolite may provide opportunities for discovery when other synthesis parameters are systematically screened. Thus, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;n&#8208;propylimidazolium has allowed to crystallize the new large/medium pore zeolite HPM&#8208;16 as well as the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore &#8208;SYT and the medium/small pore and chiral STW. The sophisticated OSDA originally affording &#8208;SYT and the new simple OSDA have very little in common, both in terms of size, shape and flexibility, while both may still direct the synthesis of the same zeolite. In fact, molecular simulations show that the new OSDA is located in three different positions of the &#8208;SYT structure, including the discrete 8MR where the original organic could not fit.

We have isolated and analyzed the reactivity of the key intermediate 1 formed during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates starting from amines, CO2, and Si(OMe)4. The reaction mechanism was analyzed by using DFT. The catalytic system was modified and various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates that could be used as industrially important polyurethane raw materials were synthesized by using atmospheric CO2.







Abstract
We have successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)4. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of 1 with Si(OMe)4 proceeds via a five&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)4 as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the five&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO2 under atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of a Substrate for SNAP&#8208;Tag Expands Its Application for Recognition&#8208;Driven DNA&#8208;Protein Conjugation</title>

Protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they contain both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. We have designed new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking by protein MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag.







Abstract
Recognition&#8208;driven modification has been emerging as a novel approach to modifying biomolecular targets of interest site&#8208;specifically and efficiently. To this end, protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA as they consist of both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain (DBD) and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. Coupling DNA recognition by DBD and the chemoselective reaction of the protein tag could provide a highly efficient sequence&#8208;specific reaction. However, combining an MA consisting of a reactive protein&#8208;tag and its substrate, for example, SNAP&#8208;tag and benzyl guanine (BG), revealed rather nonselective reaction with DNA. Therefore new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag have been designed to realize sequence&#8208;selective rapid crosslinking reactions of MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag. The reactions of substrates with SNAP&#8208;tag were verified by kinetic analyses to enable the sequence&#8208;selective crosslinking reaction of MA. The new substrate enables the distinctive orthogonality of SNAP&#8208;tag against CLIP&#8208;tag to achieve orthogonal DNA&#8208;protein crosslinking by six unique MAs.

         <title>Flexibility Control of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers by Crystal Morphology: Water Adsorption and Thermal Expansion</title>

Preparing nanoplates of flexible two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers provides significant structural changes involving the contraction of undulating layers. Such crystal morphology and size effects on layer structures modulate the dual functions of water adsorption and anisotropic thermal expansion.







Abstract
Layer flexibility in two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D&#8208;CPs) contributes to several functional materials as it results in anisotropic structural response to external stimuli. Chemical modification is a common technique for modifying layer structures. This study demonstrates that crystal morphology of a cyanide&#8208;bridged 2D&#8208;CP of type [Mn(salen)]2[ReN(CN)4] (1) consisting of flexible undulating layers significantly impacts the layer configuration and assembly. Nanoplates of 1 showed an in&#8208;plane contraction of layers with a longer interlayer distance compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rod&#8208;type particles. These effects by crystal morphology on the structure of the 2D&#8208;CP impacted the structural flexibility, resulting in dual&#8208;functional changes: the enhancement of the sensitivity of structural transformation to water adsorption and modification of anisotropic thermal expansion of 1. Moreover, the nanoplates incorporated new adsorption sites within the layers, resulting in the uptake of an additional water molecule compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rods.

A microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozymes cascade platform was constructed for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. Glucose oxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme were brought into close proximity through hybridization with miRNA&#8208;21 in MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells, resulting in efficient production of hydroxyl radicals to kill cancer cells. The system presented enhanced catalytic activity and minimal off&#8208;target toxicity, and provided an effective strategy for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Off&#8208;target toxicity and insufficient hydroxyl radicals (.OH) generation limit the further clinical application of nanozymes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we designed and constructed a microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozyme cascade platform for enhanced tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. The nanozyme&#8208;based cascade reaction could be triggered successfully by the high expression of microRNA in cancer cells to generate more .OH, thus exhibiting excellent tumor&#8208;specific therapeutic performance. Our work provides a new dimension for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Inversion of Selectivity in the Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18084-18092, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base catalyzed acylation of aromatic 1,2&#8208;ethylenediols with anhydrides depends strongly on the size of the reagents and the &#960;&#8208;system of the diol. Steric effects have a larger impact on reactions of primary hydroxyl groups in the 1,2&#8208;diol as well as the monoester than those of secondary hydroxyl groups. For sterically demanding anhydrides this flips the selectivity towards secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Relative rates for the Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover&#8208;limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2&#8208;diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects.

     alt="Size-Induced Inversion of Selectivity in the Acylation of 1,2-Diols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lewis-base&lt;/b&gt; catalyzed acylation of aromatic 1,2-ethylenediols with anhydrides depends strongly on the size of the reagents and the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-system of the diol. Steric effects have a larger impact on reactions of primary hydroxyl groups in the 1,2-diol as well as the monoester than those of secondary hydroxyl groups. For sterically demanding anhydrides this flips the selectivity towards secondary alcohols.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative rates for the Lewis base-catalyzed acylation of aryl-substituted 1,2-diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover-limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2-diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects. In absolute terms the first acylation step is found to be up to 35&#8197;times faster than the second one for the primary alcohols due to neighboring group effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Frontispiece: Photocatalytic Activity of Supported Metal Nanoparticles and Single Atoms</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) demonstrate photocatalytic behavior because of their unique coordination environment and electronic structure. The metallic photocatalysts can be implanted in porous materials such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to enhance the photocatalytic activity by exploiting the merits of both the metal species and the porous catalyst supports.

We have successfully isolated the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), which is an intermediate in the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and Si(OMe)4. By analyzing the reaction mechanism based on the reactivity of 1 and DFT calculations, we improved the catalytic system and synthesized various organic carbamates&#8212;including polyurethane raw materials&#8212;by using CO2 at 1&#8197;atm.

         <dc:description>
The aim of this review is to present precisely defined amphiphilic dendrons (dendritic wedges), generally based on known dendrimers (aryl ether, amidoamine, amide, quaternary carbon, alkyl ether, ester, main group element), their self&#8208;association properties, and their uses, in particular for encapsulation and delivery of bioactive entities. In most cases, the hydrophilic part is constituted by the terminal functions of the dendrons, whereas one or two hydrophobic tails are linked to the core. Read more in the Review article by E. Apartsin and A.&#8208;M. Caminade on page&#8197;17976&#8197;ff.

N versus O donor: Isostructural complexes [An(pyren)2] (An=Th, U&#8211;Pu) with a pyrrole&#8208;based ligand (pyren) were synthesised and compared to the structural relative salen. Solid&#8208;state analysis and quantum chemical calculations reveal an increased bond strength to the imine nitrogen when changing the second donor from the dominant O to the softer N. In the complexes, the overall bond strength of salen exceeds pyren, except for the Pa case. This can be explained by a greater degree of polarizability for the Pa 5&#8201;f1 state. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. M&#228;rz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102849).

         <title>Cover Feature: From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis (Chem. Eur. J. 72/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 17973-17973, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rearrange and aromatise: After a thiourea derivative has been transformed to a benzothiazine heterocycle, thioquinoline heterocycles can be formed by gold catalysis. The stability of the products is represented by the low level in the railway, while the gold catalysis will help to overcome the energetic barrier represented by the mountains. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Salvador and M.&#8197;C. Gimeno (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103439).

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Associations of Amphiphilic Dendrons and Their Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 17976-17998, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrons are molecular trees, constituted of a tail (a trunk) to which several branches are attached. The different types of self&#8208;associations of amphiphilic dendrons at the air&#8208;water interface, as micelles or as vesicles is described. The properties of these associations of dendrons (direct or reverse micelles or vesicles) in particular as carriers of drugs or of DNA or siRNA, or as drugs by themselves is also discussed.







Abstract
This review presents precisely defined amphiphilic dendrons, their self&#8208;association properties, and their different uses. Dendrons, also named dendritic wedges, are composed of a core having two different types of functions, of which one type is used for growing or grafting branched arms, generally multiplied by 2 at each layer by using 1&#8594;2 branching motifs. A large diversity of structures has been already synthesized. In practically all cases, their synthesis is based on the synthesis of known dendrimers, such as poly(aryl ether), poly(amidoamine) (in particular PAMAM), poly(amide) (in particular poly(L&#8208;lysine)), 1&#8594;3 branching motifs (instead of 1&#8594;2), poly(alkyl ether) (poly(glycerol) and poly(ethylene glycol)), poly(ester), and those containing main group elements (poly(carbosilane) and poly(phosphorhydrazone)). In most cases, the hydrophilic functions are on the surface of the dendrons, whereas one or two hydrophobic tails are linked to the core. Depending on the structure of the dendrons, and on the experimental conditions used, the amphiphilic dendrons can self&#8208;associate at the air&#8208;water interface, or form micelles (eventually tubular, but most generally spherical), or form vesicles. These associated dendrons are suitable for the encapsulation of low&#8208;molecular or macromolecular bioactive entities to be delivered in cells. This review is organized depending on the nature of the internal structure of the amphiphilic dendrons (aryl ether, amidoamine, amide, quaternary carbon atom, alkyl ether, ester, main group element). The properties issued from their self&#8208;associations are described all along the review.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization: Recent Progress and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18015-18028, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developments in the area of temperature&#8208;controlled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry are reviewed and compared to other biophysical methods for characterizing folding and interactions. The designs of several TC&#8208;ESI sources are discussed, as well as selected applications.







Abstract
Native electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) allow researchers to analyze intact biomolecules and their complexes by mass spectrometry (MS). The data acquired using these soft ionization techniques provide a snapshot of a given biomolecules structure in solution. Over the last thirty years, several nESI and ESI sources capable of controlling spray solution temperature have been developed. These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques. This review highlights how the field of temperature&#8208;controlled mass spectrometry has developed.

         <title>Photocatalytic Activity of Supported Metal Nanoparticles and Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 17999-18014, December 23, 2021. </description>

Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) can be stabilized on porous supports including metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to enhance photocatalytic activity for environmental remediation and clean energy production.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has been known as one of the promising technologies due to its eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, the potential application of many photocatalysts is limited owing to their large bandgaps and inefficient use of the solar spectrum. One strategy to overcome this problem is to combine the advantages of heteroatom&#8208;containing supports with active metal centers to accurately adjust the structural parameters. Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) are excellent candidates due to their distinctive coordination environment which enhances photocatalytic activity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) have shown great potential as catalyst support for SACs and MNPs. The numerous combinations of organic linkers with various heteroatoms and metal ions provide unique structural characteristics to achieve advanced materials. This review describes the recent advancement of the modified MOFs, COFs and g&#8208;C3N4 with SACs and NPs for enhanced photocatalytic applications with emphasis on environmental remediation.

The direct synthesis of diaryl sulfones from aryl silanes, SO2 surrogate, and aryl iodides is performed thanks to an air&#8208;stable Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies support a Cu(I)/Cu(III)&#8208;based mechanism with fast insertion of the small molecule into the Cu&#8722;C bond of a copper&#8208;aryl intermediate.







Abstract
An air&#8208;tolerant Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling reaction enabling the formation of diaryl sulfones is described. Starting from aryl silanes, DABSO and aryliodides, the reaction tolerates a large variety of polar functional groups (amines, ketones, esters, aldehydes). Control experiments coupled with DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism, characterized by the formation of a Cu(I)&#8208;sulfinate intermediate via fast insertion of a SO2 molecule.

         <title>Parts&#8208;per&#8208;Million&#8208;Level, Catalytic [3+2]&#8208;Annulations for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Methanobenzo[7]annulenes</title>

Methanobenzo[7]annulenes. Parts&#8208;per&#8208;million catalyst loading for [3+2]&#8208;annulations. An unprecedented, ppm&#8208;level, catalytic asymmetric [3+2]&#8208;annulation of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;lawsones with nitroethylenes is reported. It is an efficient, sustainable, catalytic asymmetric annulation reaction for the synthesis of chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes, which are part of many antibiotics.







Abstract
3&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;lawsones selectively reacted with &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;nitroethylenes under 500 parts&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) quinine&#8208;NH&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysis to furnish the chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes in up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and TON up to 1820 through tandem Michael/Henry [3+2]&#8208;annulations. These asymmetric ppm&#8208;level, catalytic tandem [3+2]&#8208;annulations would be highly inspirational for the design of many more ppm&#8208;level organocatalytic reactions, and at the same time these final molecules are basic skeletons of antibiotics.

         <title>Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Provides Alkylated Tryptophans and Tryptophan Regioisomers</title>

Non&#8208;canonical amino acids. The portfolio of possible late&#8208;stage derivatisations of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophan has been expanded by Palladium&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling for a direct alkylation of bromotryptophan and the synthesis of tryptophan regioisomers from bromoindole derivatives.







Abstract
Mild transition&#8208;metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings enable direct functionalisation of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophans with alkyl iodides, representing a new alternative for late&#8208;stage derivatisations of halogenated aromatic amino acids. Moreover, this strategy enables preparation of (homo)tryptophan regioisomers in a simple two&#8208;step synthesis using a Pd&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling. This method provides access to non&#8208;canonical constitutional surrogates of tryptophan, ready for use in peptide synthesis.

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18029-18032, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of benzothiazine heterocycles starting from thioureas has been achieved. With gold catalysis, these organic compounds evolved in basic medium towards the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment.







Abstract
New benzothiazine heterocycles have been formed from thiourea derivatives by using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions were optimised towards the selective synthesis of six&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold&#8208;derived species have a great potential for biological applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aqueous Neptunium(III) Halide Solvates from NpO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 72, Page 18054-18057, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neptunium's fundamental chemistry is understudied when compared to the rest of the periodic table and early actinides like uranium and thorium. Therefore, synthesis of starting materials is of utmost importance for investigation of its chemical properties. NpO2 was dissolved in HCl and converted to two novel neptunium(III) solvated halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4. The reported syntheses are convenient and do not require neptunium metal.







Abstract
Two Np(III) halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4, have been prepared and isolated in high yields as described in this work. Starting with neptunia (NpO2), NpCl4(DME)2 was first generated in an updated, higher yielding synthesis than what was previously reported by using HCl/HF. This material was then reduced with KC8, followed by subsequent ligand exchange, to generate NpBr3(THF)4 and NpI3&#8208;(THF)4. Full characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the molecular formulas and oxidation states. These trivalent materials are straightforward to synthesize and can be used as starting materials for non&#8208;aqueous Np(III) chemistry, obviating the need for rare and restricted Np metal and elemental halogens.

         <dc:description>Bistable spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;  T  1/2  ) spin&#8208;state switching are desirable for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications. In this study, we report on the structural facets governing hysteretic SCO in a set of iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes&#8212;[Fe(bpp&#8208;COOEt)  2  ](X)  2  &#183;CH  3  NO  2  (X = ClO  4  ,  1  ; X = BF  4  ,  2  ). Stable spin&#8208;state switching&#8212;  T  1/2  = 288 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 62 K&#8212;is observed for  1  , whereas  2  underwent above room&#8208;temperature lattice&#8208;solvent content&#8208;dependent SCO&#8212;  T  1/2  = 331 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 43 K. Variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations&#8212;from the Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted HS&#8208;state to less distorted LS&#8208;state&#8212;and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in  1  and  2  . Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule&#8208;based switching and memory elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Light sensitive phenacyl crosslinked dextran hydrogels for controlled delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials enable controlled release of loaded drug molecules and biomolecules. Controlled release of potent chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agent is crucial to reduce unwanted side effects. In an effort to develop controlled release strategies that can be triggered using Cerenkov luminescence, we have developed polymer hydrogels that can release bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G using light (254 nm &#8211; 375 nm) as a trigger. We describe the synthesis and photochemical characterization of two light sensitive phenacyl bis&#8208;azide crosslinkers that are used to prepare transparent self&#8208;supporting hydrogel patches. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (14%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375 nm light. We used the extended phenacyl crosslinker for the preparation of protein&#8208;loaded dextran hydrogel patches, which showed efficient and selective dosed release of bovine serum albumin or immunoglobulin G after irradiation with 375 nm light. Cerenkov&#8208;triggered release is as yet inconclusive due to unexpected side&#8208;reactivity. Based on the high quantum yield, efficient release and large overlap with the Cerenkov window, we envision application of these photosensitive soft materials in radiation targeted drug release.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Alkali&#8208;Metal Effects in the Structures and Reactivity of Mixed&#8208;Ligand Alkyl/Alkoxide Alkali&#8208;Metal Magnesiates</title>

         <dc:description>Advancing understanding of using alkali&#8208;metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8208;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed&#8208;ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates [MMg(CH2SiMe3)2(dmem)]2[dmem= 2&#8208;{[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M= Li,&#160;1; Na,&#160;2; (THF)K,&#160;3] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali&#8208;metal effect with potassium magnesiate&#160;3&#160;being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr2(dmem)]2&#160;(Ar=&#160;o&#8208;OMe&#8208;C6H4)&#160;intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]n&#160;and [MgAr(dmem)]2&#160;(5). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;= 2&#8208;ethylhexyl) which undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Mg(CH2SiMe3) to give [KMg(CH2SiMe3)2(OR&#8217;)]2&#160;(7). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2&#8208;bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr2(OR&#8217;)]2&#160;(9) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali&#8208;metal mediated Mg&#8208;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>

Direct action: A highly stereoselective glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages is disclosed, which employs a combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent and exploits glycosidation via glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. A variety of natural saponins containing (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan motifs are thus synthesized in convergent manner by direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors.







Abstract
Conventional syntheses of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement for a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here, a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG is disclosed; it employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with 12 (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and 13 alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative, naturally occurring triterpene saponins were thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicated that this glycosylation proceeds by SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8722;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species that activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8722; ensures an uninterruptive role for the glycosidation.

         <title>Rhodium and Iridium Complexes of Anionic Thione and Selone Ligands Derived from Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Taken under its wing: Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal, inter alia, their ability to develop secondary arene&#8208;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands.







Abstract
The lithium salts of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones and selones [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}Li(toluene)] (1: E=S; 2: E=Se; WCA=B(C6F5)3, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which contain a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety in the imidazole backbone were reacted with Me3SiCl, to furnish the silylated adducts (WCA&#8208;IDipp)ESiMe3 (3: E=S; 4: E=Se). The reaction of the latter with [(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)MCl2]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the rhodium(III) and iridium(III) half&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}MCl(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5)] (5&#8211;8). The direct reaction of the lithium salts 1 and 2 with a half or a full equivalent of [M(COD)Cl]2 (M=Rh, Ir) afforded the monometallic complexes [{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M(COD)] (9&#8211;12) or the bimetallic complexes [&#956;2&#8208;{(WCA&#8208;IDipp)E}M2(COD)2(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)] (13&#8211;16), respectively. The bonding situation in these complexes has been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing thiolate or selenolate ligand character with negligible metal&#8208;chalcogen &#960;&#8208;interaction.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial proteases able to hydrolyze insoluble proteins in the presence of surfactants remains essential for their structural characterization. Therefore, we report for the first time metal&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate complexes (M&#8208;K 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 where M = Zr(IV) or Hf(IV)) as catalysts for the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein, zein, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) via a competitive binding mechanism, which results in a dependence of the hydrolysis on the surfactant concentration.







Abstract
Despite the enormous importance of insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] (M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in ternary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering measurements.

         <title>Interfacially Super&#8208;Assembled Benzimidazole Derivative&#8208;Based Mesoporous Silica Nanoprobe for Sensitive Copper (II) Detection and Biosensing in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique mesoporous silica nanoprobe (DHBM&#8208;MSN) based on benzimidazole derivative is constructed for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. The designed DHBM&#8208;MSN has obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solution with extremely low detection limit. The detection system is successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice and live cells. The results indicate that DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) functionalized with benzimidazole&#8208;derived fluorescent molecules (DHBM) are fabricated via a feasible interfacial superassembly strategy for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+. DHBM&#8208;MSN exhibits an obvious quenching effect on Cu2+ in aqueous solutions, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;M. The DHBM&#8208;MSN solid&#8208;state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that nanocarriers with different morphologies do not affect the specific detectionability. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental results and density function theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu2+ in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. These results indicate that the DHBM&#8208;MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.

DHBM-MSN exhibits an obvious quenching effect on Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous solutions, and the detection limit can be as low as 7.69&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M. The DHBM-MSN solid-state sensor has good recyclability, and the silica framework can simultaneously improve the photostability of DHBM. Two mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different morphologies were specially designed to verify that nanocarriers with different morphologies do not affect the specific detectionability. The detection mechanism of the fluorescent probe was systematically elucidated by combining experimental results and density function theory calculations. Moreover, the detection system was successfully applied to detect Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in bovine serum, juice, and live cells. These results indicate that the DHBM-MSN fluorescent sensor holds great potential in practical and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Oximes to Hydroxylamines: Current Methods, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to access hydroxylamine derivatives? Likely, one of the most straightforward strategy involves the catalytic reduction of oximes. These substrates are however difficult to reduce selectively as overeduction breaks their weak N&#8722;O bond giving primary amines instead. The few different capable catalytic systems are overviewed in this minireview as well as new opportunities for advancing the research field are suggested.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8722;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the E/Z&#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Photosynthetic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to emulate functions of the native photosynthetic apparatus by artificial systems are introduced. One approach involves the integration of native photosynthetic systems with artificial materials onto electrode surfaces to yield photobioelectrochemical cells. A second approach involves the assembly of supramolecular photosensitizer/electron acceptor assemblies leading to the efficient light&#8208;induced formational of election&#8208;transfer redox products. A third approach addresses the design of dynamic networks stimulating controlled electron&#8208;transfer processes leading to the formation of fuel products under thermodynamically&#8208;guided or out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.







Abstract
Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents recent advances towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid/electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Gold Nanoclusters: Synthesis Strategies, Optical Properties, and Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in water&#8208;dispersible gold nanoclusters in terms of their synthesis strategies, optical properties, and bio&#8208;applications is discussed. Different synthesis strategies for water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs are highlighted. The progress achieved in the optical properties and biological applications of these molecules is also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for their further development of are presented.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. Intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels have endowed them with fascinating electronic and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the fields of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, biochemical sensing, bio&#8208;imaging, and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most AuNCs are synthesized in organic solvents and do not disperse in aqueous solutions; this restricts their biological applications. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs and their biological applications. We first review different methods of synthesis, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic AuNCs. We then discuss their photophysical properties, such as emission enhancement and fluorescence lifetimes. Next, we summarize their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outline the challenges and potential for the future development of these AuNCs.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Cell Adhesions by Using Bipolar Nanoelectrode Array</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method for fast and positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed using oxygen as the electrochemical probe. The successful imaging is achieved by transient generation of difference in oxygen concentration over the nanoelectrodes covered with or without cells. Thus, cell morphology and adhesion strength can be imaged.







Abstract
A label&#8208;free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving voltage of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V is applied to in&#8197;situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1&#8197;V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label&#8208;free imaging of single cells.

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Cu nanosheets array support structure was provided as the substrate of organic photocathode, which provides more reactive sites and increases the effective light absorption area. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu NSA increases the distribution range of the built&#8208;in electric field, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the photocatalytic performance. The proposal of the simple support structure provides a direction for the design and implementation of spatially separated PEC cell.







Abstract
The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carrier separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced a copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly.

     alt="Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A simple Cu nanosheets array support structure&lt;/b&gt; was provided as the substrate of organic photocathode, which provides more reactive sites and increases the effective light absorption area. Furthermore, the introduction of Cu NSA increases the distribution range of the built-in electric field, thus improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the photocatalytic performance. The proposal of the simple support structure provides a direction for the design and implementation of spatially separated PEC cell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Z-scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z-scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carrier separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced a copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built-in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3-hexylthiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;[6,6]-phenyl-C&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;-butyric acid (P3HT&#8201;:&#8201;PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50&#8197;mV to 0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8722;1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and co-catalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14&#8201;% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging of a Perylene Moiety Enables a RuII Photosensitizer with Long&#8208;Lived Excited States and the Efficient Production of Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two are better than one: In a joint study, groups in two laboratories at TU Braunschweig and Ulm University present a novel bichromophoric RuII complex. This unique photosensitizer was obtained by fusing a ruthenium polypyridine chromophore with an additional perylene dye. This photosensitizer exhibits a strong absorptivity in the visible region and an enhanced excited state lifetime of 8&#8197;&#956;s. In addition, this complex enables the efficient production of singlet oxygen. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Rau, S. Tschierlei, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103609).

         <title>Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interdisciplinary character of the Horizon2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;EJD TubInTrain project allowed a challenging study of the peculiarity of maytansinoids as tubulin binders. The enthusiasm of PhD students proved fundamental for productively merging synthesis, biological evaluation, X&#8208;ray crystallography and docking studies. The good agreement of computational and experimental sheds further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and provides a solid foundation for the future design, synthesis and analysis of next&#8208;generation maytansinoids.

         <title>Tunable surface electric field of electrode materials via constructing Schottky heterojunctions for selective conversion of trash ions to treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytically conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reaction. Here, we introduce a concept&#8208;new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and NO  x  &#8208;  reduction reaction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytically conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reaction. Here, we introduce a concept-new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well-designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre-adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and NO  x  -  reduction reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback.

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired transformations to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are reported. An important biosynthetic transformation mediated by &#946;&#8208;glycosidase were replaced with a simple removal of the silyl group from designed strictosidine aglycone silyl ether derivatives. Subsequent bioinspired transformations under substrate control resulted in the concise and divergent total syntheses of heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids.







Abstract
A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8722;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8722;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13&#8197;steps.

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three equivalents of heteroallene can be captured between the Si&#8722;P bonds of Zintl&#8208;derived clusters. Silyl coordination at either the nitrogen or chalcogen of the heteroallene can be controlled by tuning the groups on the silyl moiety or functional groups at the heteroallene. It was also found that one captured small molecule can be exchanged for another, evidencing small molecule catch and release at these clusters.







Abstract
Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P7(SiR3)3) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.

         <title>Utilisation of CO2 as &#8220;Structure Modifier&#8221; of Inorganic Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is abundant and free but environmentally unfriendly. It is also unreactive, hence re&#8208;purposing can be a challenge. This research article describes how CO2 can be used as a useful reagent towards the preparation and/or chemical and structural modification of inorganic solids. This approach is of wide application hence, in the future, it may become part of a toolbox of methods to reduce the environmental impact of CO2.







Abstract
Utilisation of CO2 as a chemical reagent is challenging, due to the molecule's inherent chemical stability. However, CO2 reacts promptly at high temperature (&#8764;1000&#8201;&#176;C) with alkaline&#8208;earth oxides to form carbonates and such reactions are used towards capture and re&#8208;utilisation. In this work, this concept is extended and CO2 is utilised as a reagent to modify the crystal structure of mixed&#8208;metal inorganic solids. Modification of the crystal structure is a &#8220;tool&#8221; used by materials scientists to tailor the physical property of solids. CO2 gas was reacted with several isostructural mixed&#8208;metal oxides Sr2CuO3, Sr1.8Ba0.2CuO3 and Ba2PdO3. These oxides are carefully selected to show anion vacancies in their crystal structure, to act as host sites for CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of carbonate anions, (CO3)2&#8722;. The corresponding oxide carbonates were formed successfully and the favourable formation of SrCO3 as secondary phase was minimised via an innovative, yet simple synthetic procedure involving alternating of CO2 and air. We also derived a simple model to predict the kinetics of the reactions for the cuprates, using first&#8208;principles density functional theory and assimilating the reaction to a gas&#8208;surface process.

         <title>Properties of Single&#8208;Component Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) were produced, where the materials contained a crystalline and glass phase from the same parent zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF): ZIF&#8208;62(Zn). The composites displayed thermal and adsorptive properties present in both the original crystalline and glass materials and interfacial compatibility between the two phases was evident. A mixed&#8208;metal Co/Zn analogue was also produced to further examine phase&#8208;mixing.







Abstract
The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF&#8208;62(Zn) was incorporated within an agZIF&#8208;62(Zn) matrix. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of agZIF&#8208;62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed&#8208;metal (ZIF&#8208;62(Co))0.5(agZIF&#8208;62(Zn))0.5 analogue. CO2 gas adsorption measurements showed that the CO2 uptakes of the MOF&#8208;CGCs were between those of the crystalline and glassy phases.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It depends how you look at it: By exploring randomly formed domains of microcrystalline finasteride dispersed in a KCl pellet with the spatial resolution of 0.1&#8197;mm granted by synchrotron source, we noticed that anisotropic ECDi (ACD) spectra might be very different from the emergent solid&#8208;state ECD spectrum recorded on a commercial instrument, which is similar to the solution ECD. Consequently, we got an exclusive insight into the critical role played by local domains.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ECD (ss&#8208;ECD) spectra of a model microcrystalline solid, finasteride, dispersed into a KCl pellet were recorded by using the synchrotron radiation source at the Diamond B23 beamline. Scanning a surface of 36&#8197;mm2 with a step of 0.5&#8197;mm, we measured a set of ECD imaging (ECDi) spectra very different from each other and from the ss&#8208;ECD recorded with a bench&#8208;top instrument (1&#8197;cm2 area). This is due to the anisotropic part of the ECD (ACD), which averages to zero in solution or on a large number of randomly oriented crystallites, but can otherwise be extremely large. Two&#8208;way singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, through experimental and simulated TDDFT spectra, disclosed that the measured and theoretical principal components are in line with each other. This finding demonstrates that the observed isotropic ss&#8208;ECD spectrum is governed by the anisotropy of locally oriented crystals. It also introduces a new quality for ss&#8208;ECD measurements and opens a new future for probing and mapping chiral materials in the solid state such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

         <title>Increased Photostability of the Integral mRNA Vaccine Component N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Compared to Uridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photodynamics of the methylated isomer, N1&#8208;methylpseudouridine (m1&#968;), which is commonly used in mRNA therapeutics were investigated alongside the canonical base uridine; m1&#968; was found to have a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield than uridine. However, following UVC irradiation m1&#968; is shown to be ca. 6.7&#8197;times more photostable than uridine.







Abstract
N1&#8208;Methylation of pseudouridine (m1&#968;) replaces uridine (Urd) in several therapeutics, including the Moderna and BioNTech&#8208;Pfizer COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. Importantly, however, it is currently unknown if exposure to electromagnetic radiation can affect the chemical integrity and intrinsic stability of m1&#968;. In this study, the photochemistry of m1&#968; is compared to that of uridine by using photoirradiation at 267&#8197;nm, steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Furthermore, femtosecond transient absorption measurements are collected to delineate the electronic relaxation mechanisms for both nucleosides under physiologically relevant conditions. It is shown that m1&#968; exhibits a 12&#8208;fold longer 1&#960;&#960;* decay lifetime than uridine and a 5&#8208;fold higher fluorescence yield. Notably, however, the experimental results also demonstrate that most of the excited state population in both molecules decays back to the ground state in an ultrafast time scale and that m1&#968; is 6.7&#8208;fold more photostable than Urd following irradiation at 267&#8197;nm.

         <title>Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active Photochromic Phenanthrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of photochromic phenanthrene derivatives bearing pyridine or pyridinium units have been synthetized and characterized by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the different substitution positions yield to a drastic difference on the photo and electrochromic properties of these systems. These compounds derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds show good qualities for the applications in optoelectronic devices, as opto&#8208;transistors or in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
A phenanthrene unit has been functionalized by several methylthiophene units in order to bring it a photochromic behavior. These compounds were characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies, theoretical calculations as well as cyclic voltammetry. The association of a phenanthrene group with a photochromic center could open the door to a new generation of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium, the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide, the aluminium bis(hydrogensulfide), the six&#8208; or five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide as well as a rare five&#8208;membered heterocyclic aluminium sulfide were synthesized controllably in mild manners. Reactions of the known dihydridoaluminium and the terphenyl dihydridoaluminium with various thiation reagents formed a series of aluminium&#8208;sulfur species. This provided insights into the influence of the supporting ligands on the reactivity and stability.







Abstract
Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions owing to limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (1) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium 1Tipp, 1 features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide 2, the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 4 and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide 6 to be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8722;S&#8722;P five&#8208;membered ring (7) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

Herein, facile isolation of diverse molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene-stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;Tipp&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, the six-membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and the five-membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; to be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8722;S&#8722;P five-membered ring (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Cage&#8208;Based Emulsifiers: Templated Formation of Metal Oxide Microcapsules Monitored by In Situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>

Self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles captured in action: Non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly of heteroleptic coordination cages results in Gemini amphiphiles, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions. Serving as water&#8208;free medium, the emulsion&#8208;templated synthesis of metal oxide microcapsules from water&#8208;sensitive precursors can be carried out in controlled fashion. The formation of hollow metal oxide microcapsules was visualized by in&#8197;situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping.







Abstract
Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (CGA&#8208;3; CGA=Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques. In situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of p&#8208;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>

         <dc:description>Cu  2  O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, while serious electron&#8208;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement of the PEC activity. In this work, CeO  2  nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the Cu  2  O octahedra surface, successfully constructing Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in which p&#8208;n heterojunction and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) structure work together. The optimum Cu  2  O/CeO  2  composite without the use of any cocatalyst exhibits 5 times higher photocurrent density (4.63 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu  2  O octahedra, which is better than most Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with the advanced Cu  2  O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu  2  O/CeO  2  (Faradaic efficiency of ~100%) is 17.5 times higher than that of pure Cu  2  O octahedra and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12 h stability test. The delicately designed Cu  2  O/CeO  2  structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;  iso  &#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesised and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 3  10  helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1 nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reactions between fluoroalkenes and silyl ketene acetals gave vinylic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;functionalized products under mild and simple conditions. Carboboration reaction of fluoroalkenes generates an oxygen&#8208;stabilized silylium ion to facilitate the C&#8722;F bond cleavage. DFT and IBO studies were performed to clear the reaction mechanism. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes due to the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity.







Abstract
Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8722;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8722;F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8722;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8722;F bond of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8722;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8722;F bond transformation.

Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8722;F bond transformation of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8722;F bond of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon-fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8722;F bond. A broad range of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8722;F bond transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plus side of amyloids? Peptide amyloids have an inherent templating ability that underlies the infectivity and progression of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases as well as guiding the synthesis of melanin. Such amyloid&#8208;based templating has been shown to support the sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective addition of amino acids to a complementary peptide chain. Here we report that the templating nature of amyloids also supports the autocatalytic self&#8208;replication of peptides. The relevance to a prebiotic role for amyloids is discussed.







Abstract
The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable both of self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, no plausible prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids, we present two systems in which the products of a peptide&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with specific response to the unique tumor microenvironment (TME) feature providing 100% metal atoms utilization for high&#8208;efficient enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy and accurate template for the study of therapeutic mechanisms. In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated.

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive  Monobridged Ge(&#181; &#8208;H)GeH Molecule via Non&#8208;Adiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH (X  1  A') molecule was prepared in gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium (Ge) with germane (GeH  4  ). Merged with electronic structure calculations, this reaction was revealed to commence on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond via a submerged barrier forming the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH  3  ); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH  3  predominantly isomerized via two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H  2  GeGe) and di&#8208;bridged (Ge(  &#181;  &#8208;H  2  )Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of&#160;the cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C  2  H  2  surface, deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing non&#8208;classical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8211;stabilized perfluorinated palladium cages catalyze the additive&#8211;free aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8211;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8211;Pd  2+  coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8211;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd  2+  to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O  2  for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H  2  transfer to alkynes, which normally prevents from observing parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP). Nevertheless, specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled detection of important HCAT&#8208;alkyne&#8208;H  2  intermediates via substantial  1  H,  11  B and  15  N signal enhancements and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The one&#8208;electron reduction reactions of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (  IF  ) with various alkali metals bring about the radical anion salts. The different structures and properties are characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and physical property measurement system (PPMS).  IF  &#8226;&#8722;  K  +  (18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is regarded as a one&#8208;dimensional magnetic chain through C&#8208;H&#8208;C&#160;interaction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The one-electron reduction reactions of indeno[2,1-a]fluorene-11,12-dione (  IF  ) with various alkali metals bring about the radical anion salts. The different structures and properties are characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and physical property measurement system (PPMS).  IF  &#8226;&#8722;  K  +  (18-c-6) is regarded as a one-dimensional magnetic chain through C-H-C&#160;interaction.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Mesoporous Carbons from Cyclodextrin Nanosponges Enabling High&#8208;Capacity Silicon Anodes and Sulfur Cathodes for Lithiated Si&#8208;S Batteries</title>

A facile production strategy to synthesize Si and S directly within porous carbon derived from cyclodextrin nanosponges. These materials act as high capacity electrodes in Lithiated Si&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. Their typical structure of truncated cone can host a wide variety of guest molecules to create inclusion complexes; indeed, we daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high&#8208;capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and guarantees stable cycling performance. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. We show that the use of commercial LP30 electrolyte causes a larger capacity fade, and this is associated with different solid electrolyte interface layer formation and it is also demonstrated that fluoroethylene carbonate addition can significantly increase the capacity retention and the overall performance of our nanostructured Si/C composite in both ether&#8208;based and LP30 electrolytes. As a result, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8722;S cell.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Fe/N/C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Containing Fe&#8722;N4 Sites from an Iron Complex Precursor with 5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;Diazatriphenylene Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts are prepared from iron complex precursors containing 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene ligands with two bromo substituents by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. The iron complex precursors were efficiently converted to atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 active sites without generating less active iron aggregates during pyrolysis. The Fe&#8722;N4 active sites were identified by STEM&#8208;EELS observations and in&#8197;situ electrochemical Fe K edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic measurements. The Fe/N/C catalysts show high catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts containing Fe&#8722;Nx sites prepared by pyrolysis are promising cathode materials for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. We have developed iron complexes containing N2&#8208; or N3&#8208;chelating coordination structures with preorganized aromatic rings in a 1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene framework tethering bromo substituents as precursors to precisely construct Fe&#8722;N4 sites in an Fe/N/C catalyst. One&#8208;step pyrolysis of the iron complex with carbon black forms atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N4 sites without iron aggregates. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical measurements revealed that the iron complex with N3&#8208;coordination is more effectively converted to Fe&#8722;N4 sites catalyzing ORR with a TOF value of 0.21&#8197;e&#8201;site&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 0.8&#8197;V vs. RHE. This indicates that the formation of Fe&#8722;N4 sites is controlled by precise tuning of the chemical structure of the iron complex precursor.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competition for the lone pair: Our paper describes efforts to access cationic &#945;&#8208;silylated (and &#945;&#8208;germylated) phosphorus ylides of the general formula [R3PC(R)SiR2]+. One inherent feature of these molecules is that the silyl and phosphonyl entities compete for the lone pair of electrons. The ambivalent nature of the possible resonance structures is reflected in the coloured segmentation of the cover feature. The two &#8220;competitors&#8221; are illustrated as sportspersons, and both resonance structures are represented depending on where the ball of positive change is. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Breher et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103974).

Two positional isomers are presented, p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT, and their structural feature is mainly different in one BT substituent position on HBT fluorophore. Surprisingly, they exhibited totally opposite luminescence behaviour in water/THF cosolvents with different water volume fractions (fw). More importantly, the unique AIE&#8208;ESIPT properties allowed p&#8208;BHBT to construct the chemosensor, Probe&#8208;1, for highly selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.







Abstract
Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to p&#8208;BHBT and ortho position refers to o&#8208;BHBT). Fluorescence emission properties of p&#8208;BHBT and o&#8208;BHBT in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which p&#8208;BHBT showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while o&#8208;BHBT displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, Probe&#8208;1, generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore p&#8208;BHBT, was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22&#8197;&#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.

         <title>Light&#8208;assisted Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides: The synergetic effect between plasmonic copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes from various sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, we loaded plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving the high yield of diaryl ethers. We believe that this study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically&#8208;sustainable process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>"Xenophilic" complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe&#160;two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8211;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8211;Fp (LX&#160;=&#160;b&#8208;aldiminate or&#160;b&#8208;diketim&#173;inate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into the Fe&#8211;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electro&#173;static interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8211;&#160;"metalloligand" as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange&#8208;red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In case of orange&#8208;red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters. And the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange&#8208;red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra, therefore more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange&#8208;red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters based on molecular structures such as cyano benzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron based acceptors. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange&#8208;red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: A Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designer tri&#8208;block copolymer is described to broaden epigenetic combination therapy. Upon intracellular reduction and esterase hydrolysis, it releases nothing but HDACi (histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug, CO2, and PEG. The design is rooted from a thiol&#8208;based HDACi, for which optimization balances requirements of both efficacy and control&#8208;release, highlighting a new paradigm in polyprodrug nanomedicine: taking pharmaceutics guidelines into account at the medicinal chemistry stage.







Abstract
We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end&#8208;to&#8208;end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach, carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work highlights, for the first time, the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.

         <title>Mild Microfluidic Approaches to Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports the preparation of oxide nanoparticles in microreactors under continuous flow conditions. The use of suitable methodologies allows to manage the size and shape of the nanoparticles, through the fast mixing of the reagents and the precise control of the reaction conditions that can be achieved within flow devices, if compared to batch syntheses.







Abstract
Oxide nanoparticles (oxide NPs) are advanced materials with a wide variety of applications in different fields. The use of continuous flow methods is particularly appealing for their synthesis due to the high control achieved over the reaction conditions and the easy process scalability. The present review focuses on the preparation of oxide NPs using microfluidic setups at low temperature (&#8804;80&#8201;&#176;C), since the employment of mild reaction conditions is crucial for developing sustainable and cost&#8208;effective processes. A particular emphasis will be put on the improvement over the final product features (e.&#8201;g., size, shape, and size distribution) given by flow methods with respect to conventional batch procedures. The main issues that arise by treating NPs suspensions in microfluidic systems are product deposition or channel clogging; mitigation strategies to overcome these drawbacks will also be presented and discussed.

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular uptake of high&#8208;density brush polymers with peptide side chains is governed by the net charge of the polymers. Stimuli responsive cleavable linkers are employed to control the charge of the polymers and to trigger cellular uptake of brush polymers possessing a net positive charge.







Abstract
Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids through stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.

         <title>Understanding the Preparation and Reactivity of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The life of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5. Non&#8208;oxidative methane dehydroaromatization is a high&#8208;temperature reaction taking place over zeolite&#8208;based Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst. We used operando spectroscopy to monitor the structural evolution of Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 during its whole lifetime: from catalyst synthesis and activation to reaction, deactivation, and regeneration. We derived spectroscopic descriptors for molybdenum precursor decomposition, reduction of dispersed Mo&#8208;oxo centers to form active sites and, finally, evolution of active sites during reductive and oxidative regeneration.







Abstract
Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts during their whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of similar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincides with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalysts.

         <title>Assessing the Importance of Cation Size in the Tetragonal&#8208;Cubic Phase Transition in Lithium&#8208;Garnet Electrolytes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high temperature tetragonal&#8208;cubic phase in lithium garnet electrolytes (A3B2Li7O12) is not fully understood. Herein, the transition temperature dependence based on site substitution is investigated, surprisingly it was found a direct relationship to cell volume is perhaps too simplistic. We show that the B site plays an important role, whereas A site substitution (which alters the cell volume noticeably) has minimal difference. The octahedral site ionic radius required to stabilise a room temperature A3B2Li7O12 cubic phase is then suggested.







Abstract
Lithium garnets are promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of seven lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g., La3Zr2Li7O12), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8211;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub&#8208;lattice.
The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.
Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed by variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.

However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of seven lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g., La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8211;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub-lattice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed by variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The rapid development of industrialization and population brings water and air pollution and energy crisis. Solar driven catalysis is expected to relieve above issues. However, low efficiency of solar conversion limited by poor light harvesting and serious charge recombination of semiconductors and high surface reaction barriers is far from the satisfactory of industrial request. Ferroelectrics have been considered as promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO  3  , PbTiO  3  and LiNbO  3  , layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like BiFeO  3  , Bi  2  WO  6  , Bi  2  MoO  6  , etc. and other ferroelectrics have been introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method have been highlighted. Then, the research progress of ferroelectrics for photocatalysis has been summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO  2  reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts have been provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present a deep insight and guideline for the future research works of ferroelectrics  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Ferroelectric Metallomesogen Exhibiting Field&#8208;Induced Slow Magnetic Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional Co(II) compound exhibiting liquid crystal, ferroelectricity, and field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior has been synthesized for the first time. The results provide new insights towards the development of a new category of magnetoelectric (ME) materials.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) materials exhibiting coupled electric and magnetic properties are of significant interest because of their potential use in memory storage devices, new sensors, or low&#8208;consumption devices. Herein, we report a new category of ME material that shows liquid crystal (LC), ferroelectric (FE), and field&#8208;induced single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviors. Co(II) complex incorporating alkyl chains of type [Co(3C16&#8208;bzimpy)2](BF4)2 (1; 3C16&#8208;bzimpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;(4&#8208;hexadecyloxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;hexadecyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)) displayed a chiral smectic C mesophase in the temperature range 321&#8197;K&#8211;458&#8197;K, in which distinct FE behavior was observed, with a remnant polarization (88.3&#8197;nC&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Complex 1 also exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation behavior that reflects the large magnetic anisotropy of the Co(II) center. Furthermore, the dielectric property of 1 was able to be tuned by an external magnetic field occurring from both spin&#8208;lattice coupling and molecular orientational variation. Clearly, this multifunctional compound, combining LC, FE, and SMM properties, represents an entry to the development of a range of next&#8208;generation ME materials.

         <title>Spiroconjugated Tetraaminospirenes as Donors in Color&#8208;Tunable Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emitters go spiro: Using spiroconjugated tetraamines as a novel type of donor and a range of different acceptors in three different modes of connection, 12 donor&#8208;acceptor compounds are synthesized. Their twisted structures lead to a spatial separation of the HOMOs and LUMOs. Photophysical measurements show tunable emission colors for these donor&#8208;acceptor compounds, and photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 99&#8201;% in solution are obtained.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer emitters are attractive due to their color tunability and potentially high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). We herein present tetraaminospirenes as donor moieties, which, in combination with a variety of acceptors, furnished 12 charge&#8208;transfer emitters with a range of emission colors and PLQYs of up to 99&#8201;%. The spatial separation of their frontier molecular orbitals was obtained through careful structural design, and two DA structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A range of photophysical measurements supported by DFT calculations shed light on the optoelectronic properties of this new family of spiro&#8208;NN&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor dyes.

         <title>Molecular Modelling and Simulations of Light&#8208;Harvesting Decanuclear Ru&#8208;Based Dendrimers for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molucular simulations on the structure of a decanuclear Ru&#8208;based dendrimer capable to play the role of antenna for artificial photosynthesis is performed. Aggregation of dendrimers is also modelled and compared to experimental results obtained by SAXS, scanning tunneling electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
The structure of a decanuclear photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active dendrimer based on Ru(II) polypyridine subunits, suitable as a light&#8208;harvesting multicomponent species for artificial photosynthesis, has been investigated by means of computer modelling. The compound has the general formula [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru[(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru(bpy)2]2}3](PF6)20 (Ru10; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; dpp=2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazine). The stability of possible isomers of each monomer was investigated by performing classical molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM) simulations on each monomer and comparing the results. The number of stable isomers is reduced to 36 with a prevalence of MER isomerism in the central core, as previously observed by NMR experiments. The simulations on decanuclear dendrimers suggest that the stability of the dendrimer is not linked to the stability of the individual monomers composing the dendrimer but rather governed by the steric constrains originated by the multimetallic assembly. Finally, the self&#8208;aggregation of Ru10 and the distribution of the counterions around the complexes is investigated using Molecular Dynamics both in implicit and explicit acetonitrile solution. In representative examples, with nine and four dendrimers, the calculated pair distribution function for the ruthenium centers suggests a self&#8208;aggregation mechanism in which the dendrimers are approaching in small blocks and then aggregate all together. Scanning transmission electron microscopy complements the investigation, supporting the formation of different aggregates at various concentrations.

         <title>Chiral Ligands in Hypervalent Iodine Compounds: Synthesis and Structures of Binaphthyl&#8208;Based &#955;3&#8208;Iodanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contained chirality: Novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents are presented with the chirality contained only in the ligand. These have been characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, and all derivatives show the prominent reactivities of hypervalent iodine reagents. Due to their limited stability in solution, they are inefficient chiral iodine(III) derivatives.







Abstract
Several novel binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents have been prepared and structurally analysed. Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed; however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. NMR experiments indicated that these reagents are very easily hydrolysed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to the limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contained chirality&lt;/b&gt;: Novel binaphthyl-based chiral hypervalent iodine(III) reagents are presented with the chirality contained only in the ligand. These have been characterized by X-ray analysis, and all derivatives show the prominent reactivities of hypervalent iodine reagents. Due to their limited stability in solution, they are inefficient chiral iodine(III) derivatives.

         <title>Direct Near Infrared Light&#8211;Activatable Phthalocyanine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going in for infra red: The development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules is described. The choice of solvent is important to promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction involves a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.







Abstract
The high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light makes it effective for use in selective reactions under light&#8208;shielded conditions, such as in sealed reactors and deep tissues. Herein, we report the development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules. The desired photocatalytic properties were achieved in the phthalocyanines by introducing the appropriate peripheral substituents and central metal. These phthalocyanine photocatalysts promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling (CDC) under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. The choice of solvent is important, and a mixture of a reaction&#8208;accelerating (pyridine) and &#8208;decelerating (methanol) solvents was particularly effective. Moreover, we demonstrate photoreactions under visible&#8208;light&#8208;shielded conditions through the transmission of NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction does not involve a photoredox&#8208;type mechanism with electron transfer, but instead a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.

Compounds [1]+.[R]&#8722; and [1]2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[R]&#8722; have been prepared from the respective one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron transfer reactions of 1,4&#8208;disilabenzene (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (1) by using the transferable organometallic oxidants and characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;transferable oxidants such as B(C6F5)3/nBuLi, B(C6F5)3/LiB(C6F5)4, B(C6F5)3/LiHBEt3, Al(C6F5)3/(o&#8208;RC6H4)AlH2 (R=N(CMe2CH2)2CH2), B(C6F5)3/AlEt3, Al(C6F5)3, Al(C6F5)3/nBuLi, Al(C6F5)3/AlMe3, (CuC6F5)4, and Ag2SO4, respectively were employed for reactions with (L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2 (L=PhC(NtBu)2, 1). The stable radical cation [1]+. was formed and paired with the anions [nBuB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 2), [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (in 3), [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 4), [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 5), {[(C6F5)3Al]2(&#956;&#8208;F)]&#8722; (in 6), [nBuAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (in 7), and [Cu(C6F5)2]&#8722; (in 8), respectively. The stable dication [1]2+ was also generated with the anions [EtB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (9) and [MeAl(C6F5)3]&#8722; (10), respectively. In addition, the neutral compound [(L)2Si2C4(SiMe3)2(C2SiMe3)2][&#956;&#8208;O2S(O)2] (11) was obtained. Compounds 2&#8211;11 are characterized by UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and elemental analysis. Compounds 2&#8211;8 are analyzed by EPR spectroscopy and compounds 9&#8211;11 by NMR spectroscopy. The structure features are discussed on the central Si2C4&#8208;rings of 1, [1]+., [1]2+, and 11, respectively.

         <title>Ring Opening Reactions of &#946;&#8208;Propiolactam in Superacidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/  M  F  5  (  M  &#160;=&#160;Sb,&#160;As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8209;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]. In presence of water traces, the diprotonated species of  &#946;  &#8208;alanine [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, in case of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  , single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted. By using SO  2  instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NHSO][SbF  6  ]  2  was obtained, and a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from  N  &#8209;protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, and the MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory, respectively, were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated  &#946;  &#8208;propiolactam.</dc:description>

Additionally, in case of [C(O)F(CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][SbF  6  ] and [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NH  3  ][AsF  6  ]  2  , single-crystal X-ray analyses were conducted. By using SO  2  instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)  2  (CH  2  )  2  NHSO][SbF  6  ]  2  was obtained, and a single-crystal X-ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open-chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from  N  &#8209;protonated  &#946;  -propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, and the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, respectively, were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated  &#946;  -propiolactam.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Superacid&#8208;Promoted Difluoroethylation of Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through an original superelectrophile&#8208;promoted difluoroethylation in superacid, CF2&#8208;Me aromatic amines can be synthesized directly and regioselectivity. Applied to simple substrates, natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients, this method offers an alternative for the late&#8208;stage synthesis of aryl methyl ethers bioisosters.







Abstract
Under superacid conditions, aromatic amines are directly and regioselectively 1,1&#8208;difluoroethylated. Low temperature in situ NMR studies confirmed the presence of benzylic &#945;&#8208;fluoronium and &#945;&#8208;chloronium ions as key intermediates in the reaction. This method has a wide substrate scope and can be applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural alkaloids and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

         <title>Rearrangements in Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Uranium(IV) Thio&#8208; and Selenoether Complexes: Syntheses, Structures, and Computational Investigation of U&#8722;ER2 Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranium&#8212;selenoether linkages have been accessed for the first time, enabling the study of U&#8722;SeR2 versus U&#8722;SR2 and U&#8722;OR2 bonding. The shape of the uranium selenoether complex resembles a butterfly, and the cover art depicts a metamorphosis from the protio&#8208;ligand (caterpillar), to the potassium salt of the ligand (chrysalis), to the uranium complex (butterfly).

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes Bearing Axially Chiral Bipyridyls: The Mismatched Diastereomer Showed Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RutheniumII complexes bearing axially chiral bipyridyls were synthesized, and matched (more relaxed) &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and mismatched (more constrained) &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer was nonluminescent. In contrast, the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited vivid red circularly polarized phosphorescence. For the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the cumulative CH/&#960; interactions seem to suppress further distortion in the T1 state.







Abstract
RutheniumII complexes bearing three axially chiral bipyridyl ligands were synthesized as a new family of chiral complex dyes, and &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggested that all the bipyridyls maintained chirality in both the ground and excited states, and the &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomers are the matched (more relaxed) and mismatched (more constrained) pairs, respectively. The mismatched &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited red circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) both in solution and in the solid state. The solution state CPP is the most intense of ruthenium complexes, while the solid state CPP is the first example of them. It is supposed that, for the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the six cumulative CH/&#960; interactions suppress further distortion in the T1 state.

         <title>Two Faces of the Same Coin: Coupling X&#8208;Ray Absorption and NMR Spectroscopies to Investigate the Exchange Reaction Between Prototypical Cu Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed investigation of the reduction of the octahedral Cu(terpyridine)22+ complex to the tetrahedral Cu(neocuproine)2+ complex using the chemical fuel 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as reductant, has been carried out by exploiting an innovative mechanistic tool based on the complementarity of X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies coupled with Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analys.







Abstract
The satisfactory rationalization of complex reactive pathways in solution chemistry may greatly benefit from the combined use of advanced experimental and theoretical complementary methods of analysis. In this work, we combine X&#8208;Ray Absorption and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analyses to gain a comprehensive view on a prototypical reaction involving the variation of the oxidation state and local structure environment of a selected metal ion coordinated by organic ligands. Specifically, we investigate the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid reduction of the octahedral complex established by the Cu2+ ion with terpyridine to the tetrahedral complex formed by Cu+ and neocuproine. Through our interdisciplinary approach we gain insights into the nature, concentration time evolution and structures of the key metal (XAS measurements) and organic (1H NMR measurements) species under reaction. We believe our method may prove to be useful in the toolbox necessary to understand the mechanisms of reactive processes of interest in solution.

         <title>New Palladium &#8211; ZrO2 Nano&#8208;Architectures from Thermal Transformation of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for Carbonylative Suzuki and Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 nanocomposites, obtained by direct pyrolysis of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under nitrogen or air, presented high ability to form benzophenone according to carbonylative Suzuki pathway under 1&#8197;atm of CO with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1. Pd/ZrO2 nanocomposites are superior catalysts of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Its morphology was preserved during the catalytic reaction.







Abstract
The new nanocomposites, Pd/C/ZrO2, PdO/ZrO2, and Pd/PdO/ZrO2, were prepared by thermal conversion of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2 (MOF) in nitrogen or air atmosphere. The presence of Pd nanoparticles, uniformly distributed on the ZrO2 or C/ZrO2 matrix, was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman and X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) methods. All pyrolysed composites retained the shape of the MOF template. They catalyze carbonylative Suzuki coupling under 1&#8197;atm CO with an efficiency significantly higher than the original Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2. The most active PdO/ZrO2 composite, formed benzophenone with TOF up to 1600&#8197;h&#8722;1, while by using Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8722;NH2, much lower TOF values, 51&#8211;95&#8197;h&#8722;1, were achieved. After the reaction, PdO/ZrO2 was recovered with the same composition and catalytic activity. Very good results were also obtained in the transfer hydrogenation of benzophenones to alcohols with Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation.

         <dc:description>A  P  &#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (  R,R  )&#8208; or (  S,S  )&#8208;dpmppm(=O)  4  , was synthesized to prepare  C  2  dinuclear M(hfa)  3  complexes (M = Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with  P  &#8208;chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)  3  complexes (M = Eu, Y) with a  P  &#8208;chiral diphosphine oxide, tpdpb(=O)  2  , were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the Eu(III) complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the  P  &#8208;chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)  3  units through intramolecular &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene:&#160;Photophysical Properties and Solid State Intermolecular Interactions of Radially Arranged, Congested Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Planes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives, containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of a two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited state dynamic behavior occurring between the three radially arranged anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with a ca. 3.0 &#197; distances between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradation of herbicides by a plant nonheme iron dioxygenase: mechanism and selectivity of substrate analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogs by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C  2  &#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the  R  &#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.</dc:description>

In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 10  7  M  &#8208;1  and large exothermicities &#916;  H  &#176; of &#8208;14 kcal/mol in a 120 mM K  +  buffer at 40 &#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted  N  5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8208;H activation for cysteine bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8208;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Bonding Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8208;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy) 3  2+  ) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03 &#956;M to 300 &#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013 &#181;M (3&#963;/ m  ). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.</dc:description>

With perylene we can: The incorporation of an additional perylene dye enables the creation of a novel multichromophoric RuII photosensitizer that exhibits a strong absorptivity in the visible as well as a unique excited&#8208;state behavior. Moreover, this complex was found to efficiently generate singlet oxygen upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Multichromophoric systems based on a RuII polypyridine moiety containing an additional organic chromophore are of increasing interest with respect to different light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel RuII photosensitizer, namely [(tbbpy)2Ru((2&#8208;(perylen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]&#8208;phenanthrolline))](PF6)2 RuipPer, that includes a merged perylene dye in the back of the ip ligand. This complex features two emissive excited states as well as a long&#8208;lived (8&#8197;&#956;s) dark state in acetonitrile solution. Compared to prototype [(bpy)3Ru]2+&#8208;like complexes, a strongly altered absorption (&#1013;=50.3&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 467&#8197;nm) and emission behavior caused by the introduction of the perylene unit is found. A combination of spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy was used to elucidate the nature of the excited states. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully used for the efficient formation of reactive singlet oxygen.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic Stereotriads Featuring Fluorinated Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence of two unprecedented steps is described to build acyclic stereotriads bearing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter. The sequence combines a highly diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction from readily available starting materials with an acylative double organocatalyzed kinetic resolution (DoCKR) providing enantioenriched products. This method is practically simple, general, and flexible affording different diastereomers depending on the initial substrates. A mechanistic study supports the observed stereochemistry of fluorinated products.







Abstract
Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction directly generates a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5).

         <title>Solvothermal Synthesis of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with Magnetically Frustrated [Cr7S8]5+ Double&#8208;Cubes**

Novel compound, [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O was synthesized by using DMSO as a source of sulfur in solvothermal synthesis. Crystal structure is composed of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]3+ units connected into 2D layers by bridging ethylenediamine ligands. Magnetic interactions between Cr3+ centers in [Cr7S8]5+ core units were studied using magnetometry and DFT calculations. Strong antiferromagnetic coupling was observed in the peripheral Cr3 triangles as well as between central and peripheral Cr atoms of the Cr7 cluster leading to high degree of frustration.







Abstract
A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with [Cr7S8]5+ dicubane cationic clusters, has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method, using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (en) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi&#8208; and monodentate coordination modes; in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8&#8197;K, a highly negative Weiss constant, &#952;=&#8722;224(2)&#8197;K, obtained from Curie&#8208;Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility, suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between S=3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2S+1)7=16384 microstates from seven Cr3+ centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be J1=&#8722;21.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;30.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr3+ center and the peripheral Cr3+ ions of the dicubane cluster. The best simulation of the experimental data was obtained with J1=&#8722;20.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and J2=&#8722;21.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1, in agreement with the slightly stronger AFM exchange within the triangles of the peripheral Cr3+ ions as compared to the AFM exchange between the central and peripheral Cr3+ ions. This compound is proposed as a synthon towards magnetically frustrated systems assembled by linking dicubane transition metal&#8208;chalcogenide clusters into polymeric networks.

         <dc:description>
To overcome the limits of the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)(benzene)]+ have been used to prepare sandwich complexes [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+. NMP is used to promote the substitution of naphthalene with simple arenes as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin. This compound can be used to unambiguously confirm the radioactive sandwich complexes [99mTc(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;arene sandwich complexes are generally prepared by the Fischer&#8208;Hafner reaction, which conditions are incompatible with most O&#8208; and N&#8208; functional groups. We report a new way for the synthesis of sandwich type complexes [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+ from [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)2]+ and [Re(&#951;6&#8208;napht)(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)]+, with functionalized arenes and pharmaceuticals. N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine (NMP) facilitates the substitution of naphthalene with the incoming arene. A series of fully characterized rhenium sandwich complexes with simple arenes, such as aniline, as well as with active compounds like lidocaine and melatonin are presented. With these rhenium compounds in hand, the radioactive sandwich complexes [99mTc(&#951;6&#8208;pharm)2]+ (pharm=pharmaceutical) can be unambiguously confirmed. The direct labelling of pharmaceuticals with 99mTc through &#951;6&#8208;coordination to phenyl rings and the confirmation of the structures with the rhenium homologues opens a path into molecular theranostics.

         <title>Photobase&#8208;Driven Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in a Strapped &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>

A pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore acts as a photobase to induce strap&#8208;to&#8208;&#960; excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) from a strapped ammonium moiety. This new design of an ESIPT fluorophore, which is suitable for use in acidic media, produces a significantly red&#8208;shifted orange emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.







Abstract
We report a new design strategy for an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore that can be used in acidic media. A photobasic pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type fluorophore is combined with a basic trialkylamine &#8220;strap&#8221;. In the presence of an acid, protonation occurs predominantly at the amine moiety in the ground state. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a pre&#8208;organized intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure between the resulting ammonium moiety and the pyridine ring. Upon excitation, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transition increases the basicity of the pyridine moiety in the excited state, resulting in proton transfer from the amine to the pyridine moiety. Consequently, the fluorophore takes on a polymethine&#8208;dye character in the ESIPT state, which gives rise to significantly red&#8208;shifted emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Characterising a Weak Halogen Bond in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very weak halogen bonds are excessively difficult to characterise in solution. We present an approach for the detailed NMR spectroscopic description of very weak interactions, providing the solution ensemble of the flexible model compound, the accurate geometry of the binding sites and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters. Here NOE abbreviates nuclear Overhauser effect, RDC corresponds to residual dipolar coupling, and &#916;T indicates variable temperature experiments.







Abstract
Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8208;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE&#8208; and RDC&#8208;based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.

CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ/pp structures of mercury oxides. The Hg&#8722;Hg bond of OHgHgO is shorter than that of HgHgO, similar to the Hg+(CN)2 system. Besides the broad absorption at &#8764;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 of &#8722;(HgO)n&#8722; in reactions of Hg and O2, HgO appeared at 521.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1, compared to 828.0 and 619.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for PtO and AuO. The band at 676&#8197;cm&#8722;1 observed in reactions of Hg and O3 was assiged to HgHgO.







Abstract
An investigation of pulsed&#8208;laser&#8208;ablated Zn, Cd and Hg metal atom reactions with HCN under excess argon during co&#8208;deposition with laser&#8208;ablated Hg atoms from a dental amalgam target also provided Hg emissions capable of photoionization of the CN photo&#8208;dissociation product. A new band at 1933.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in the region of the CN and CN+ gas&#8208;phase fundamental absorptions that appeared upon annealing the matrix to 20&#8197;K after sample deposition, and disappeared upon UV photolysis is assigned to (Ar)nCN+, our key finding. It is not possible to determine the n coefficient exactly, but structure calculations suggest that one, two, three or four argon atoms can solvate the CN+ cation in an argon matrix with C&#8722;N absorptions calculated (B3LYP) to be between 2317.2 and 2319.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Similar bands were observed in solid krypton at 1920.5, in solid xenon at 1935.4 and in solid neon at 1947.8&#8197;cm&#8722;1. H13CN reagent gave an 1892.3 absorption with shift instead, and a 12/13 isotopic frequency ratio&#8211;nearly the same as found for 13CN+ itself in the gas phase and in the argon matrix. The CN+ molecular ion serves as a useful infrared probe to examine Ng clusters. The following ion reactions are believed to occur here: the first step upon sample deposition is assisted by a focused pulsed YAG laser, and the second step occurs on sample annealing: (Ar)2++CN&#8594;Ar+CN+&#8594;(Ar)nCN+.

         <dc:description>
The interaction of a redox&#8208;active trinuclear, self&#8208;assembled Ru metallomacrocycle with oxo&#8208;anions is reported and its affinity for these anions and halides in different oxidation states is calculated, revealing both high affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for some guests) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1). Detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies on the host in each of its oxidation states, revealed that it binds anion guests by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions, including charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The interaction of the self&#8208;assembled trinuclear ruthenium bowl 13+, that displays three other accessible oxidation states, with oxo&#8208;anions is investigated. Using a combination of NMR and electrochemical experimental data, estimates of the binding affinities of 14+, 15+, and 16+ for both halide and oxo&#8208;anions were derived. This analysis revealed that, across the range of oxidation states of the host, both high anion binding affinities (&gt;109&#8197;M&#8722;1 for specific guests bound to 16+) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) were observed. As the crystal structure of binding of the hexafluorophosphate anion revealed that the host has two potential binding sites (named the &#945; and &#946; pockets), the host&#8208;guest properties of both putative binding sites of the bowl, in all of its four oxidation states, were investigated through detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies. These studies revealed that, due to the interplay of ion&#8208;ion interactions, charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, binding to the &#945; pocket is generally preferred, except for the case of the relatively large and lipophilic hexafluorophosphate anionic guest and the host in the highest oxidation states, where the &#946; pocket becomes relatively favourable. This analysis confirms that host&#8208;guest interactions involving structurally complex supramolecular architectures are driven by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions and, even in the case of charged binding pairs, simple ion&#8208;ion interactions alone cannot accurately define these recognition processes.

         <title>Tuning peptide structure and function through fluorobenzene stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides was developed. This enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with  ortho  ,  meta  or  para  relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant difference in potency and efficacy demonstrates how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n = 6, 4, and 2): Focusing on the effect of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C 18  ) precursors, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), are studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It is found that C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8208;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960; out  and &#960; in  ) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C 18  . However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) compared to C 18  . Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960; in  system, and the &#960; out  system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) with larger n  shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960; out  electron delocalization in the C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 6, 4, and 2) and C 18  in terms of gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C 18  &#8208;(CO) n  ( n  = 4 and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120 &#181;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200 &#181;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method for studying enzyme&#8208;ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>An alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;Ru(II) polypyridine complex for targeted antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize clinical application of antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), one of the most arduous challenges is how to render aPDT agents a high selectivity against bacterial pathogens. In light of the fact that amino group&#8208;containing lipids are rich on the outer surfaces of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, we herein constructed an alkynyl&#8208;dangling&#160;ruthenium (II) polypyridine complex (  Ru2  ) to preferentially label  Staphylococcus aureus  and methicillin&#8208;resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) over mammalian cells via the amino&#8208;yne bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. Thanks to the strong singlet oxygen generation ability,  Ru2  could photo&#8208;inactivate  S. aureus  and MRSA effectively and specifically. phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules also exist in mammalian cells but are not accessible for  Ru2  , leading to its poor binding/uptake and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark and upon irradiation towards mammalian cells as well as low hemolysis, all favorable for aPDT application.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 3  10  helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. Yet, the screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus.  1  H and  19  F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their  N  &#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 3  10  &#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle  19  F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@hydrogel system for antibacterial therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Here, we propose an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained&#8208;release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) was loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8211;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Z&#8208;scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction for boosting photo&#8208;oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide under ambient conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In  2  S  3  show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalysis property is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In  2  S  3  /NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalysis reveal that the superoxide radical (&#8226;O  2  &#8208;  ) and singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis, Configurational Assignment and Biological Evaluations of the Lipid Mediator RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  , an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a  Z  &#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  methyl ester in 13% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2  n&#8208;3 DPA  also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of  S. aureus  and zymosan A bioparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Coexistence of Tellurium Cations and Anions in Phosphonium&#8208;based Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental tellurium readily dissolves in ionic liquids based on tetraalkylphosphonium cations even at temperatures below 100 &#176;C. In the case of ILs with acetate, decanoate, or dicyanamide anions, dark red to purple colored solutions form. A study combining NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of tellurium anions (Te  n  )  2&#8211;  with chain lengths up to at least  n  = 5, which are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. Since external influences could be excluded and no evidence of an ionic liquid reaction was found, disproportionation of the tellurium is the only possible dissolution mechanism. Although the spectroscopic detection of tellurium cations in these solutions is difficult, the coexistence of tellurium cations, such as (Te  4  )  2+  and (Te  6  )  4+  , and tellurium anions could be proven by cyclic voltammetry and electrodeposition experiments. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ILs are sufficient to stabilize both types of tellurium ions in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on utilizing two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activity for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. While bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced utilizing dual ligands in the whole   domino  process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ylide&#8208;stabilized phosphenium cations: Impact of the substitution pattern on the coordination chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Here, we report the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]  +  (with Y = Ph  3  PC(Ph), R = Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties. While the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y  2  P]  +  formed the expected LAuCl]  +  complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrodeuteration of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated alkenes is challenging because of the requirement that chemically similar hydrogen and deuterium undergo selective insertion across a &#960;&#8208;bond. We now report a highly regioselective catalytic transfer hydrodeuteration of unactivated terminal alkenes across a variety of heteroatom or heterocycle containing substrates. The base&#8208;metal catalyzed reaction is also demonstrated on two complex natural products. Reaction studies indicate modular conditions that can also be extended to perform either an alkene transfer hydrogenation or transfer deuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation induced emission leading to white light emission in diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8208;A groups or energy transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taking advantages of the impressing behaviors of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), the explorations in RTP materials are not only limited to efficient emission and ultralong lifetime of phosphorescence. The discovery and creation of stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have become the major pursuit, which will lay a solid foundation for future applications in RTP materials. Based on this, a review centered on recent progress of stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials is summarized to show frontier development in polymer systems. Different kinds of stimuli&#8208;responsive factors including light, oxygen, temperature, mechanical force and pH regulations are investigated in this review. Many potential applications and promising strategies are deeply discussed with the hope to assist future studies in this area.</dc:description>
