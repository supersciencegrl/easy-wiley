         <title>Revealing the unique role of water in the formation of benzothiazoles: an experimental and computational study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthus mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80 kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250 kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 0.75 equiv of KOH, gave up to 33% yield of LA in 44% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93% LA with 96% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8208;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving&#160;molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.</dc:description>

         <title>Blatter Diradicals with a Spin Coupler at the N(1) Position</title>

Diradicals: Simple, modular and convergent access to diradicals with controllable S&#8722;T gap demonstrated with two examples.







Abstract
Reactions of a benzo[e][1,2,4]triazine with dilithiobenzenes lead to di&#8208;Blatter diradicals connected at the N(1) positions via a spin coupling unit, 1,4&#8208;phenylene or 1,3&#8208;phenylene. Electrochemical analysis in MeCN revealed four one&#8208;electron redox processes separated by 0.1&#8211;0.3&#8197;V in both diradicals. Variable temperature EPR measurements in polystyrene (PS) solid solutions gave the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps &#916;ES&#8208;T=2&#8197;J of &#8722;3.02(11) and &#8722;0.16(1)&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 1,3&#8208;phenylene derivatives, respectively. The latter negative value was attributed to conformational properties of the diradical in the PS solid solution. Results suggest a simple and efficient access to a family of stable Blatter diradicals with a controllable S&#8722;T gap through a judicious choice of the arylene coupling unit. DFT calculations indicate that the triplet state is stabilized by (het)arylenes with low LUMO.

         <title>Amorphous TiO2 shells: an Essential Elastic Buffer Layer for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Healing Eutectic GaSn Nano&#8208;Droplet Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
The amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eGaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell forms a stable SEI film, alleviates volume expansion, and provides electron/ion transport channels. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibit high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No obvious decay is observed in more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell (~6.5&#8197;nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (in&#8197;situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge. This study elucidates the design of advanced liquid alloy&#8208;based negative electrode materials for high&#8208;performance liquid metal batteries (LMBs).

         <title>Rational design&#160;of a multifunctional benzothiadiazole derivative in organic photonics and electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8208;2 dB &#956;m&#8208;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8208;1 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, e.g. aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl a&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroditopic NHC Ligand Supported Manganese(I)&#8208;Complexes:&#160;Synthesis, Characterization, and Activity as Non&#8208;bifunctional&#160;Phosphine&#8208;Free Catalyst for the &#945;&#8209;Alkylation of Nitriles</title>

         <dc:description>In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8208;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggests that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine free Mn(I)&#8208;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, were designed and synthesized with an acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure by choosing 4,9&#8208;dihydro&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b']dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, F/n&#8208;hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)indan&#8208;1&#8208;one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H or F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT&#8208;BOF and IDT&#8208;BFO show completely planar structure. In comparison to IDT&#8208;BFO, IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits similar LUMO but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption. However, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs) coupled with PBDB&#8208;T, and PCE&#8208;10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO (PBDB&#8208;T: 5.2% vs. 6.1%; PCE&#8208;10: 1.7% vs. 3.2%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT&#8208;BOF:PBDB&#8208;T and IDT&#8208;BFO:PBDB&#8208;T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT&#8208;BOF based OSCs contributed to its lower PCE. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB&#8208;T:Y5 as control devices by adding 10% IDT&#8208;BFO exhibited a 5% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3% vs. 13.6%).</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling N2 to ammonia conversion in Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials: A new avenue in photocatalytic applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of photocatalysis has been evolving since 1972 since Honda and Fujishima&#8217;s initial push for using light as an energy source to accomplish redox reactions. Since then, many photocatalysts have been studied, semiconductors or otherwise. A new photocatalytic application to convert N2 gas to ammonia (N2 fixation or nitrogen reduction reaction; NRR) has emerged. Many researchers have steered their research in this direction due to developments in the ease of ammonia detection through UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This concept will specifically discuss Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials, techniques to enhance their photocatalytic activity (CO2 reduction, H2 production, pollutant removal, etc.), and their current application in photocatalytic NRR. Initially, a brief introduction of Bi2WO6 along with its VB and CB potentials will be compared to various redox potentials. A final topic of interest would be a brief description of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation with additional consideration to Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials in N2 fixation. A major problem with photocatalytic NRR is the false ammonia quantification in Bi&#8208;based materials, which will be discussed in detail and also ways to minimize them.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of substrate conformation by hydrogen bonding in a retaining &#946;&#8208;endoglycosidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial &#946;&#8208;glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides such as &#946;&#8208;cellulose, &#946;&#8208;glucans and &#946;&#8208;xylans from different sources, which are used in a myriad of biomedical and industrial applications. It has been shown that a conformational change of the substrate, from a relaxed 4C1 conformation to a distorted 1S3/1,4B conformation of the reactive sugar, is necessary for catalysis. However, the molecular determinants that stabilize the substrate&#8217;s distortion are poorly understood. Here we use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)&#8208;based molecular dynamics methods to assess the impact of the interaction between the reactive sugar, i.e. the one at subsite &#8208;1, and the catalytic nucleophile (a glutamate) on substrate conformation. We show that the hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in an enzyme mutant) knocks it out. We also show that 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro derivatives, widely used to trap the reaction intermediates by X&#8208;ray crystallography, reproduce the conformation of the hydrolysable substrate at the experimental conditions. These results highlight the importance of the 2&#8208;OH&#183;&#183;&#183;nucleophile interaction in substrate recognition and catalysis in endo&#8208;glycosidases and can inform mutational campaigns aimed to search for more efficient enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron(II) Complexes of P3&#8208;chain Ligands: Structural diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron(II) complexes containing ligands with a R2P&#8211;P&#8211;PR2 unit were synthesized by metathesis reactions. With R&#160;=&#160;tBu, a mixture of two isomers is formed; in one of them, the terminal phosphorus binds to the Fe center (ylidic structure), while in the other one, the central P atom is linked to Fe. Starting from differently functionalized parent triphosphanes and corresponding functionalized Fe complexes, the ratio of isomers does not change. The outcome of the reaction and therefore the binding modes of the triphosphane ligands in the resulting compounds can be influenced by the size of the substituents. In the case of R&#160;=&#160;iPr a chelate complex is formed (both terminal P atoms are linked to the Fe center). Applying the mixed&#8208;substituted triphosphane, the ylidic structure of the resulting complex is preferred. The new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in solution and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in solid&#8208;state. The synthetic work was supported by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Stable Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Bridged Regioisomeric Diradicals and Their Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. Herein, we attach two tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtain two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the enlarged conjugation as well as the electron withdrawing effects from the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes, and the spectroelectrochemistry investigation reveals the generation of organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES&#8208;T) and a pure open&#8208;shell character (with diradical character y0 = 0.966 for 1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 0.967 for 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). This work opens a window to develop very stable diradicals and offers them opportunity of further applications in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework Modified with Thioamide Groups for Selective Extraction of Palladium from Strong Acid Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient adsorption of palladium ions from acid nuclear waste solution is crucial for ensuring the safety of vitrification process for radioactive waste. However, the limited stability and selectivity of most current adsorbents hinder their practical applications under strong acid and intense radiation conditions. Herein, to address these limitations, we designed and synthesized an aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM) grafted dimethylthiocarbamoyl groups on the pore walls. This unique structure endows COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM with high stability and exceptional palladium capture capacity. The robust polyarylether linkage enables COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM to withstand irradiation doses of 200 or 400 kGy of &#946;/&#947; ray. Furthermore, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM demonstrates fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity (147 mg g&#8208;1), and excellent reusability in 4 M nitric acid. Moreover, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Propargylboration of Ketones with Allenyl&#8208;Bpins: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of tert&#8208;Homopropargyl Alcohols Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical and efficient propargylboration of ketones is presented using general allenylboronic acid pinacol esters (allenyl&#8208;Bpins) without a catalyst. This reaction is triggered by in&#8208;situ activation of stable allenyl&#8208;Bpins through the sequential addition of 1.25 equiv. of nBuLi and the prerequisite 2.0 equiv. of TFAA. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the versatile trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins react with various ketones smoothly to afford a wide range of tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins allows for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with a full chirality transfer.</dc:description>

Extractants: The diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole and its dual host systems involving crown ethers enable the extraction of various fluoride and chloride salts from water.







Abstract
The anion binding features of diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole 1 have been investigated by means of 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Receptor 1 bearing an auxiliary pyrrolic NH donor and solubilizing phenyl groups on the strap was found to bind F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and Br&#8722; as their tetrabutylammonium salts with high affinity in DMSO&#8208;d6. In addition, receptor 1 was found to extract the fluoride anion (as both its tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts), as well as the chloride anion into chloroform&#8208;d from an aqueous source phase. Cation metathesis using TBAI or the use of a dual host approach involving crown ethers enabled receptor 1 to extract simple alkali metal fluoride or chloride salts from water. Quantitative binding of NaF by receptor 1 was observed in 20&#8201;% D2O&#8208;DMSO&#8208;d6 allowing for the direct determination of the NaF concentration in an unknown sample.

         <title>2D Non&#8208;van der Waals Nanoplatelets of Hematene and Magnetene: Nonlinear Optical Response and Optical Limiting Performance from UV to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study reports that non&#8208;van der Waals 2D materials, hematene and magnetene, show very efficient optical limiting (OL) from UV to visible, with their optical limiting onset (OLon) values exhibiting a decreasing trend towards UV irradiation wavelengths. The obtained results render these materials very promising candidates for OL&#8208;related applications, such as the protection of human retinal from high&#8208;power laser.







Abstract
Recently, the preparation of some hematene and magnetene ultrathin non van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D nanoplatelets was reported starting from hematite and magnetite natural iron ores. The present work reports on the determination and evaluation of the nonlinear optical response and the optical limiting (OL) action of these 2D nanoplatelets dispersed in water under ns laser excitation. The obtained results show that both hematene and magnetene exhibit strong nonlinear absorption and refraction, comparable and even larger than those of other van der Waals (vdW) 2D counterpart materials. In addition, due to their strong nonlinear absorption, both hematene and magnetene show exceptional OL performance from the UV to visible, attaining very low values of optical limiting onset (OLon), comparable and even lower than that of vdW 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, graphene oxide, other transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2, black phosphorous and antimonene. Moreover, hematene was found to exhibit more efficient OL action than magnetene for all the excitation wavelengths studied, attributed to more efficient ligand to metal charge transfer.

     alt="2D Non-van der Waals Nanoplatelets of Hematene and Magnetene: Nonlinear Optical Response and Optical Limiting Performance from UV to NIR"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study reports that non-van der Waals 2D materials, hematene and magnetene, show very efficient optical limiting (OL) from UV to visible, with their optical limiting onset (OL&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;) values exhibiting a decreasing trend towards UV irradiation wavelengths. The obtained results render these materials very promising candidates for OL-related applications, such as the protection of human retinal from high-power laser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the preparation of some hematene and magnetene ultrathin non van der Waals (non-vdW) 2D nanoplatelets was reported starting from hematite and magnetite natural iron ores. The present work reports on the determination and evaluation of the nonlinear optical response and the optical limiting (OL) action of these 2D nanoplatelets dispersed in water under ns laser excitation. The obtained results show that both hematene and magnetene exhibit strong nonlinear absorption and refraction, comparable and even larger than those of other van der Waals (vdW) 2D counterpart materials. In addition, due to their strong nonlinear absorption, both hematene and magnetene show exceptional OL performance from the UV to visible, attaining very low values of optical limiting onset (OL&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;), comparable and even lower than that of vdW 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, graphene oxide, other transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, black phosphorous and antimonene. Moreover, hematene was found to exhibit more efficient OL action than magnetene for all the excitation wavelengths studied, attributed to more efficient ligand to metal charge transfer. The present findings open new possibilities for the potential use of these non-vdW 2D materials in photonics and optoelectronics, e.&#8201;g., as optical limiters and optical switchers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;Inorganic Ag&#8208;Based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, different dimensions of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) metal halides have been synthesized in different solvents, DMF and DMSO, respectively. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among four solvents (DMF, DMSO, DMAC, DMPU), we find the donor number plays the predominant role in the dimension tuning.







Abstract
Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46&#8201;% and 20.61&#8201;%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, DMAC, 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;Tetrahydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.

Chemical synthesis of two common core human milk oligosaccharides&#8212;para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH)&#8212;using a convergent 3+3 approach has been reported.







Abstract
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) have emerged as a very active area of research in glycoscience and nutrition. HMO are involved in the early development of infants and may help to prevent certain diseases. The development of chemical methods for obtaining individual HMO aids the global effort dedicated to understanding the roles of these biomolecules. Reported herein is the chemical synthesis of two common core hexasaccharides found in human milk, i.&#8201;e. para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH). After screening multiple leaving groups and temporary protecting group combinations, a 3+3 convergent coupling strategy was found to work best for obtaining these linear glycans.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Mono&#8208; and Dinuclear Boron Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If NHC&#8208;stabilized borenium ions [NHC&#8722;BH2]+ and [PF6]&#8722; take the same bus, they will get off neutralized and with a noticeable change, i.&#8201;e., as NHC&#8722;BF3 and PH2F3. However, if tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate is the second passenger, the anion remains untouched and a bis(boronium) or a bis(borenium) ion can enjoy the journey.







Abstract
The dinuclear bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) borane adduct 2 rapidly reacts with tritylium salts at room temperature but the outcome is strongly impacted by the respective counter&#8208;ion. Using tritylium tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate affords &#8211; depending on the solvent &#8211; either the bis(boronium) ion 4 or the hydride&#8208;bridged dication 5. In case of tritylium hexafluorophosphate, however, H/F exchange occurs between boron and phosphorus yielding the dinuclear BF3 adduct 3 along with phosphorus dihydride trifluoride. H/F exchange also takes place when using the mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene BH3 adduct 6 and hence provides a facile route to PH2F3, which is usually synthesized in more complex reaction sequences regularly involving toxic hydrogen fluoride. DFT calculations shed light on the H/F exchange between the borenium ion and the [PF6]&#8722; counter&#8208;ion and the computed mechanism features only small barriers in line with the experimental observations.

         <title>Controlling the Crystallisation and Hydration State of Crystalline Porous Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High throughput screening was used to rapidly identify a new crystalline porous salt (CPOS). Using flow chemistry, the CPOS was scaled, and the material was shown to have permeant porosity with a carbon dioxide uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous and scalable CPOS reported to date.







Abstract
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOS) are a subclass of molecular crystals. The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale&#8208;up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS&#8208;7, formed from tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS&#8208;7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS&#8208;7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS&#8208;7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS&#8208;7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS&#8208;7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date.

         <title>Closed Synthetic Cycle for Nickel&#8208;Based Dihydrogen Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand (TIMENiPr) have been synthesized and characterized. Starting from the Ni0 precursor, a NiII hydride is synthesized that reacts with protons to form a rare Ni&#8722;H2 intermediate, which was studied by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further reduction closes the synthetic cycle.







Abstract
Dihydrogen evolution was observed in a two&#8208;step protonation reaction starting from a Ni0 precursor with a tripodal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. Upon the first protonation, a NiII monohydride complex was formed, which was isolated and fully characterized. Subsequent protonation yields H2 via a transient intermediate (INT) and an isolable NiII acetonitrile complex. The latter can be reduced to regenerate its Ni0 precursor. The mechanism of H2 formation was investigated by using a deuterated acid and scrutinized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Remarkably, the second protonation forms a rare nickel dihydrogen complex, which was detected and identified in solution and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. DFT&#8208;based computational analyses were employed to propose a reaction profile and a molecular structure of the Ni&#8722;H2 complex. Thus, a dihydrogen&#8208;evolving, closed&#8208;synthetic cycle is reported with a rare Ni&#8722;H2 species as a key intermediate.

         <title>Recent Advances in Photo&#8208;Induced C&#8208;H Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H methylation is a highly valuable approach for introducing methyl groups into organic molecules, particularly in pharmaceutical chemistry. Among the various methodologies available, photo&#8208;induced methylation stands out as an exceptional choice due to its mild reaction conditions, energy efficiency, and compatibility with functional groups. This article offers a comprehensive review of photochemical strategies employed for the direct and selective methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;H, C(sp2)&#8208;H, and C(sp)&#8208;H bonds in various organic molecules. The discussed methodologies encompass transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, as well as other metal&#8208;free approaches, including electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;enabled transformations. Importantly, a wide range of easily accessible agents such as tert&#8208;butyl peroxide, methanol, DMSO, acetic acid, methyl halides, and even methane can serve as effective methylating reagents for modifying diverse targets. These advancements in photochemical C&#8208;H methylation are anticipated to drive further progress in the fields of organic synthesis, photocatalysis, and pharmaceutical development, opening up exciting avenues for creating novel organic molecules and discovering new drug compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron paramagnetic resonance, electronic ground state, and electron spin relaxation of seven lanthanide ions bound to lanmodulin and the bioinspired chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd(III), bound to small&#8208;molecule and protein chelators, are uncharacterized. Here, we systematically investigated the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions bound to the natural lanthanide&#8208;binding protein, lanmodulin (LanM), and the synthetic small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO) (&#8220;HOPO&#8221;). Echo&#8208;detected pulsed EPR spectra reveal intense signals from ions for which the normal continuous&#8208;wave first&#8208;derivative spectra are negligibly different from zero. Spectra of Kramers lanthanide ions Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Er3+, and Yb3+, and non&#8208;Kramers Tb3+ and Tm3+, bound to LanM are more similar to the ions in dilute aqueous:ethanol solution than to those coordinated with HOPO. Lanmodulins from two bacteria, with distinct metal&#8208;binding sites, had similar spectra for Tb3+ but different spectra for Nd3+. Spin&#8208;echo dephasing rates (1/Tm) are faster for lanthanides than for most transition metals and limited detection of echoes to temperatures below ~6 to 12 K. Dephasing rates were environment dependent and decreased in the order water:ethanol &gt; LanM &gt; HOPO, which is attributed to decreasing librational motion. Our results demonstrate that the EPR spectra and relaxation times of lanthanide(III) ions are sensitive to coordination environment, motivating wider application of these methods for characterization of both small&#8208;molecule and biomolecule interactions with lanthanides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized via cross&#8208;coupling of two bowl shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The obtained catcher has been unambiguously characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations indicate that the curved shape of the receptor moieties is favourable for binding fullerenes. Effective binding was confirmed for interactions with C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Weakly Self&#8208;Assembled [6]Helicenes: Circularly Polarized Light and Spin Filtering Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbo[6]helicenes decorated with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties at their periphery give access to weak self&#8208;assemblies with circularly polarized luminescence and spin selectivity.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling features, chiroptical activity, and spin filtering properties are reported for 2,15&#8208; and 4,13&#8208;disubstituted [6]helicenes decorated in their periphery with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties. The weak non&#8208;covalent interaction between these units conditions the corresponding circularly polarized luminescence and spin polarization. The self&#8208;assembly is overall weak for these [6]helicene derivatives that, despite the formation of H&#8208;bonding interactions between the amide groups present in the peripheral moieties, shows very similar chiroptical properties both in the monomeric or aggregated states. This effect could be explained by considering the steric effect that these groups could generate in the growing of the corresponding aggregate formed. Importantly, the self&#8208;assembling features also condition chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS effect), with experimental spin polarization (SP) values found between 35&#8211;40&#8201;% for both systems, as measured by magnetic&#8208;conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.

         <title>Amphiphilic Molecules Exhibiting Zwitterionic Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Near&#8208;Infrared Emission for the Detection of Amyloid &#946; Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease
</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer molecular system exhibits high affinity towards amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregates and allows for in&#8197;vivo near&#8208;infrared (NIR) imaging of amyloid plaques in transgenic Alzheimer's vs. wild&#8208;type mice.







Abstract
Chromophores with zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) have been shown to have larger Stock shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission wavelengths compared to the conventional &#960;&#8208;delocalized ESIPT molecules. However, there is still a dearth of design strategies to expand the current library of zwitterionic ESIPT compounds. Herein, a novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer system is reported, enabled by addition of 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) fragments on a dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold. The solvent&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state photophysical studies, pKa measurements, and computational analysis strongly support that the ESIPT process is more efficient with two TACN groups attached to the DCM scaffold and not affected by polar protic solvents. Impressively, compound DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT exhibits a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission at 740&#8197;nm along with an uncommonly large Stokes shift. Moreover, DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT shows high affinity towards soluble amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers in&#8197;vitro and in 5xFAD mouse brain sections, and we have successfully applied DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT for the in&#8197;vivo imaging of A&#946; aggregates and demonstrated its potential use as an early diagnostic agent for AD. Overall, this study can provide a general molecular design strategy for developing new zwitterionic ESIPT compounds with NIR emission in&#8197;vivo imaging applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their outstanding advantages, such as structural designability, good stability, and ordered pore structure. The applications of COFs in the cathode, anode, and electrolyte of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are summarized, and the relationship between the structure and electrochemical performance of COFs is elaborated.







Abstract
The development and utilization of green renewable energy are imperative with the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy crisis. In recent years, the exploration of electrochemical energy storage systems has gradually become a research hotspot in energy. Among them, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have progressively developed into highly competitive and efficient energy storage devices owing to their inherent safety, natural abundance, and higher theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of ZIBs suffers from the limitation of challenges such as the absence of proper cathode materials and the unavoidable zinc dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their inherent advantages, like structural designability, high stability, and ordered&#8208;open channels, bestowing them with great potential to overcome the problems of ZIBs. In this review, we concentrate on the discussion of designed strategies of COFs applied to ZIBs. Furthermore, the methods of using COFs to solve the challenging problems of cathode development, anode modification, and electrolyte optimization for ZIBs are summarized. Finally, the existing difficulties, solution measures, and prospects of COFs for ZIBs applications are discussed. Our commentary hopes to serve as a valuable reference for developing COFs&#8208;based ZIBs.

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of Adamantane&#8208;Modified Dyes in Aqueous Solution via Supramolecular Interaction with Methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and Their Application in Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution with high inclusion equilibrium constant based on host&#8208;guest chemistry was proposed. Fluorescent dyes based on adamantane modification could be complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). Consequently, fluorescent intensity of these dyes was significantly improved in water. And the work was further extended to fluorescent organelle targeting. Fluorescence enhancement was successfully realized in bioimaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.







Abstract
The fluorescence of functional dyes was generally quenched in aqueous solution, which hindered their application in water&#8208;bearing detections. In this work, a novel strategy based on host&#8208;guest interaction was provided for the purpose of fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution and cell imaging. Three adamantane&#8208;modified fluorescent dyes (Coum&#8208;Ad, NP&#8208;Ad, NR&#8208;Ad) with coumarin, 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Nile Red as fluorophores were initially designed and prepared. The ((adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)amino group, as the auxochrome of those dyes, complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) via supramolecular interaction, and then fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) were formed by self&#8208;assembly in water. The inclusion equilibrium constant (K) could be as high as 3.94&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1. With the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes were separately improved to 69.8&#8201;%, 32.9&#8201;% and 41.3&#8201;%. Inspired by the above satisfactory results, six adamantane&#8208;modified probes organelle&#8208;NPAds with organelle&#8208;targeting capability were further obtained. As the formation of hydrogen bonds between organelle&#8208;NPAd2 and M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD verified by theoretical calculation, K of organelle&#8208;NPAd2 (5.13&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1~4.53&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1) with M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD was higher than that of organelle&#8208;NPAd1 (1.15&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1~3.66&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1) and their fluorescence quantum yields increased to 32.8&#8201;%~83.6&#8201;% in aqueous solution. In addition, fluorescence enhancement was realized in cell imaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.

         <title>Photoisomerization of &#8220;Partially Embedded Dihydropyridazine&#8221; with a Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoisomerization of &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDH) with a helical structure inspires the demonstration of intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical and structural flexibility.

Herein, we report the synthesis of two &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDHs) and the demonstration of their intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical structure. Introducing bulky electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups into the aza[5]helicene framework (PDH&#8208;CF3 and &#8722;C2F5) gives PDH axial chirality based on the helicity of the P and M forms, even at room temperature. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation of PDH&#8208;CF3 in a frozen solution, an ESR signal from the triplet biradical with zero&#8208;field splitting values, generated by N&#8722;N bond dissociation, was observed. However, when the irradiation was turned off, the ESR signal became silent, thus indicating the existence of two equilibria: between the biradical and quinoidal forms based on the Kekul&#233; structure, and between N&#8722;N bond cleavage and recombination. The observed photo&#8208; and thermally induced behaviors indicate that T&#8208;type photochromic molecules are involved in the photoisomerization mechanism involving the two equilibria. Inspired by the photoisomerization, chirality control of PDH by photoracemization was achieved. Multiple functionalities, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to the &#8220;partially embedded dihydropyridazine&#8221; structure, are demonstrated.

&#8226; 1st Ge atom side&#8208;on coordination to C=N, &#8226; Novel mode of aromatic C&#8722;C bond activation by NHC, &#8226; Germanium atom transfer







Abstract
The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC=diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R=SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.&#8201;e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge (NHI=N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R=SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8722;Tol)Ge (R=p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge to 70&#8201;&#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8722;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8722;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8722;Tol)NGe]n

         <title>Trichlates, an Unattended Class of Compounds: Characterization of Cl3CSO2Cl, and (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so&#8208;called &#8220;trichlates&#8221; are the heavier but scarcely investigated homologues of the well&#8208;known triflates. Access to the acid (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] is the key step for the synthesis of trichlates. The acid can be prepared by chlorination of CS2, yielding Cl3CSCl, and subsequent oxidation by H2O2 giving Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of the acid.







Abstract
Chlorination of CS2 leads to trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, Cl3CSCl, in moderate yields. The oxidation of Cl3CSCl with H2O2 gives Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of trichloromethanesulfonic acid. Cl3CSO2Cl is the crucial product for the preparation of trichloromethanesulfonates (&#8220;trichlates&#8221;) and has been characterized by IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements (P&#8208;1, a=609.99(5) pm, b=727.45(6) pm, c=782.49(7) pm, &#945;=80.644(3)&#176;, &#946;=85.175(3)&#176;, &#947;=88.311(3)&#176;. The acid Cl3CSO3H can be gained in form of the hydrate (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] in two different modifications (I: monoclinic, P21/n, Z=8, a=1292.47(7) pm, b=605.89(2) pm, c=2661.1(1) pm, &#946;=98.708(4)&#176;, V=1672.8(1) &#197;3; II: monoclinic, Cc, Z=4, a=699.80(5) pm, b=1054.72(8) pm, c=1139.88(8) pm, &#946;=95.303(3)&#176;, V=837.7(1) &#197;3. Both modifications have been investigated by IR spectroscopy, thermal analyses and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Effects of the Magnetic Orientation of M13 Bacteriophage on Phage Display Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In phage display selection using M13 bacteriophage, the M13 main body, which is a huge filament&gt;103&#8197;time larger than the displayed peptide, has been considered to interfere with the result of affinity selection. This interference can be attenuated by magnetically orienting the M13 main body vertical to the target surface, which results in the suppression of nonspecific adhesion and the change in the population of selected M13 clones.







Abstract
Although phage display selection using a library of M13 bacteriophage has become a powerful tool for finding peptides that bind to target materials on demand, a remaining concern of this method is the interference by the M13 main body, which is a huge filament &gt;103&#8197;times larger than the displayed peptide, and therefore would nonspecifically adhere to the target or sterically inhibit the binding of the displayed peptide. Meanwhile, filamentous phages are known to be orientable by an external magnetic field. If M13 filaments are magnetically oriented during the library selection, their angular arrangement relative to the target surface would be changed, being expected to control the interference by the M13 main body. This study reports that the magnetic orientation of M13 filaments vertical to the target surface significantly affects the selection. When the target surface was affinitive to the M13 main body, this orientation notably suppressed the nonspecific adhesion. Furthermore, when the target surface was less affinitive to the M13 main body and intrinsically free from the nonspecific adhesion, this orientation drastically changed the population of M13 clones obtained through library selection. The method of using no chemicals but only a physical stimulus is simple, clean, and expected to expand the scope of phage display selection.

Poyl(glycerol) functionalized detonation nanodiamonds conjugated with boron&#8208;10 cluster and active targeting moiety were designed and synthesized. The nanodrugs were taken up by tumor cells and exhibited boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) efficacy upon thermal neutron irradiation.







Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), advanced cancer treatment utilizing nuclear fission of 10B atom in cancer cells, is attracting increasing attention. As 10B delivery agent, sodium borocaptate (10BSH, 10B12H11SH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2Na), has been used in clinical studies along with L&#8208;boronophenylalanine. Recently, this boron cluster has been conjugated with lipids, polymers or nanoparticles to increase selectivity to and retentivity in tumor. In this work, anticancer nanoformulations for BNCT are designed, consisting of poly(glycerol) functionalized detonation nanodiamonds (DND&#8722;PG) as a hydrophilic nanocarrier, the boron cluster moiety (10B12H112&#8722;) as a dense boron&#8208;10 source, and phenylboronic acid or RGD peptide as an active targeting moiety. Some hydroxy groups in PG were oxidized to carboxy groups (DND&#8722;PG&#8722;COOH) to conjugate the active targeting moiety. Some hydroxy groups in DND&#8722;PG&#8722;COOH were then transformed to azide to conjugate 10B12H112&#8722; through click chemistry. The nanodrugs were evaluated in&#8197;vitro using B16 murine melanoma cells in terms of cell viability, BNCT efficacy and cellular uptake. As a result, the 10B12H112&#8722; moiety is found to facilitate cellular uptake probably due to its negative charge. Upon thermal neutron irradiation, the nanodrugs with 10B12H112&#8722; moiety exhibited good anticancer efficacies with slight differences with and without targeting moiety.

         <title>A Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Silver(II) Antiferromagnet Cu[Ag(SO4)2] and Perspectives for Its Further Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuAg(SO4)2, a novel mixed&#8208;metal sulfate, shows a layered structure, with [Ag(SO4)2]2&#8722; sublattice (shown) hosting strong antiferromagnetic interactions. Calculations suggest that copper site could easily be changed for other small divalent cations, giving rise to a new family of two&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.







Abstract
Copper(II) silver(II) sulfate crystallizes in a monoclinic CuSO4&#8208;related structure with P21/n symmetry. This quasi&#8208;ternary compound features Ag(SO4)22&#8722; layers, while the remaining cationic sites may be occupied either completely or partially by Cu2+ cations, corresponding to the formula of (CuxAg1&#8722;x)[Ag(SO4)2], x=0.6&#8722;1.0. CuAg(SO4)2 is antiferromagnetic with large negative Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature of &#8722;140&#8197;K and shows characteristic ordering phenomenon at 40.4&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strongest superexchange interaction is a two&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling within Ag(SO4)22&#8722; layers, with the superexchange constant J2D of &#8722;11.1&#8197;meV. This renders CuAg(SO4)2 the rare representative of layered Ag2+&#8208;based antiferromagnets. Magnetic coupling is facilitated by the strong mixing of Ag d(x2&#8722;y2) and O 2p states. Calculations show that M2+ sites in MAg(SO4)2 can be occupied with other similar cations such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mg2+.

         <title>Nitrogen Heterocycle Synthesis through Hydride Abstraction of Acyclic Carbamates and Related Species: Scope, Mechanism, Stereoselectivity, and Product Conformation Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation&#8208;based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of sterocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Site Selectivity of Peptoids as Azobenzene Scaffold for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Storing solar energy is a key challenge in modern science. MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (t1/2 &lt; 4 days; DH~270 kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene&#8208;based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3&#8208;unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half&#8208;life of the metastable form up to 14 days at 20 &#176;C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development. We also highlight that liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry does not only enable to monitor the different stereoisomers during the photoisomerization process as traditionnaly done, but also allows to determine the thermal back&#8208;isomerization kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Avenues in Chan&#8208;Lam based Etherification Reaction: A Computational Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ongoing advances in CuII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling reactions between arylboronic esters and diverse heteroatom nucleophiles have strengthened the development of the general Chan&#8208;Lam (CL) based reaction protocol, including the C&#8722;O bond formation methodologies. In&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of CL etherification with specific emphasize on different reaction routes and its energetics are still lacking, even though the reaction has been experimentally explored. Here, we present a DFT&#8208;guided computational study to unravel the mechanistic pathways of the CL&#8208;based etherification reaction. The computational findings provide some interesting insights on the fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle, particularly the rate&#8208;determining transmetalation event. Aryl boronic ester coordinated, methoxide bridged CuII intermediate acts as resting state, which undergoes transmetalation accompanying an activation barrier of 20.4 kcal/mol. The energy spans of the remaining fundamental steps leading to the methoxylated product are relatively low. The minor product requires an additional 14.2 kcal/mol energy span to surmount in comparison to the favored route. Hammett studies for the substituted aryl boronic esters reveal higher reaction turnover for electron&#8208;rich aryl systems. The results agree with the previously reported spectroscopic and kinetic observations. For a series of alcohol substrates, it was observed that except for cyclohexanol, moderate to high etherification turnovers are predicted.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing Heteromerous Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes: Structural Effects on Thermodynamic Stability and Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) have several conformations such as twisted and anti&#8208;folded conformers, and their stereochemistry and chromism have been studied in earnest. In this study, we synthesized boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs having various tricyclic structures and investigated their photophysical properties. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the introduction of a rigid fluorene unit resulted in a twisted conformer, whereas the introduction of flexible units such as thioxanthene and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene units resulted in an anti&#8208;folded conformer. The absorption spectra of the heteromerous BAEs were dependent on the introduced tricyclic structures, suggesting the immense impact of the tricyclic structures on the electronic structures of BAEs. DFT calculations revealed the large effect of the flexibility of the tricyclic structures on the thermodynamic stability of the conformers. In addition, the boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs underwent photocyclization reactions, indicating their potential application as precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and helical aromatic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Group I Alkoxides and Amylates as Highly Efficient Silicon&#8211;Nitrogen Heterodehydrocoupling Precatalysts for the Synthesis of Aminosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Group I alkoxides and amylates efficiently catalyze the heterodehydrocoupling of challenging silane and amine substrates under mild conditions! This represents one of the most straightforward and accessible methods to form aminosilanes through heterodehydrocoupling! This train is now leaving the station &#8211; don't miss it!







Abstract
Group I alkoxides are highly active precatalysts in the heterodehydrocoupling of silanes and amines to afford aminosilane products. The broadly soluble and commercially available KOtAmyl was utilized as the benchmark precatalyst for this transformation. Challenging substrates such as anilines were found to readily couple primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes in high conversions (&gt;90&#8201;%) after only 2&#8197;h at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Traditionally challenging silanes such as Ph3SiH were also easily coupled to simple primary and secondary amines under mild conditions, with reactivity that rivals many rare earth and transition&#8208;metal catalysts for this transformation. Preliminary evidence suggests the formation of hypercoordinated intermediates, but radicals were detected under catalytic conditions, indicating a mechanism that is rare for Si&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation at Room Temperature over Pd&#8722;Zn Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexadecylamine capped Pd&#8208;Zn nanoparticles were realized by a combination of solvated metal atom dispersion and co&#8208;digestive approaches. Acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation was achieved using Pd&#8722;Zn nanoparticles at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with high selectivity towards ethylene.







Abstract
A reaction of fundamental and commercial importance is acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Acetylene impurity in the ethylene feedstock used in the polyethylene industry poisons the Ziegler&#8208;Natta catalyst which adversely affects the polymer quality. Pd based catalysts are most often employed for converting acetylene into the main reactant, ethylene, however, it often involves a tradeoff between the conversion and the selectivity and generally requires high temperatures. In this work, bimetallic Pd&#8722;Zn nanoparticles capped by hexadecylamine (HDA) have been synthesized by co&#8208;digestive ripening of Pd and Zn nanoparticles and studied for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The catalyst showed a high selectivity of ~85&#8201;% towards ethylene with a high ethylene productivity to the tune of ~4341&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It also exhibited excellent stability with ethylene selectivity remaining greater than 85&#8201;% even after 70&#8197;h on stream. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first report of room temperature acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, with the catalyst effecting high amount of acetylene conversion to ethylene retaining excellent selectivity and stability among all the reported catalysts thus far. DFT calculations show that the disordered Pd&#8722;Zn nanocatalyst prepared by a low temperature route exhibits a change in the d&#8208;band center of Pd and Zn which in turn enhances the selectivity towards ethylene. TPD, XPS and a range of catalysis experiments provided in&#8208;depth insights into the reaction mechanism, indicating the key role of particle size, surface area, Pd&#8722;Zn interactions, and the capping agent.

         <title>Atomistic&#8208;Level Effects of Noncovalent Interactions and Crystalline Packing for Organic Material Structural Integrity upon Exposure to Gamma Radiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First atomistic&#8208;level study of organic single component and cocrystalline materials upon exposure to gamma radiation. EPR and periodic DFT calculations delineated how noncovalent interactions provide a crucial role in the structural stability of these materials upon exposure to radiation.







Abstract
Developing an atomistic understanding of ionizing radiation induced changes to organic materials is necessary for intentional design of greener and more sustainable materials for radiation shielding and detection. Cocrystals are promising for these purposes, but a detailed understanding of how the specific intermolecular interactions within the lattice upon exposure to radiation affect the structural stability of the organic crystalline material is unknown. This study evaluates atomistic&#8208;level effects of &#947; radiation on both single&#8208; and multicomponent organic crystalline materials and how specific noncovalent interactions and packing within the crystalline lattice enhance structural stability. Dose studies were performed on all crystalline systems and evaluated via experimental and computational methods. Changes in crystallinity were evaluated by p&#8208;XRD and free radical formation was analyzed via EPR spectroscopy. Type of intermolecular interactions and packing within the crystal lattice was delineated and related to the specific free radical species formed and the structural integrity of each material. Periodic DFT and HOMO&#8208;LUMO surface mapping calculations provided atomistic&#8208;level identifications of the most probable sites for the radicals formed upon exposure to &#947; radiation and relate intermolecular interactions and molecular packing within the crystalline lattice to experimental results.

         <title>Valence Delocalization and Metal&#8211;Metal Bonding in Carbon&#8208;Bridged Mixed&#8208;Valence Iron Complexes
</title>

Two mixed&#8208;valence diiron complexes with carbon bridges are reported. The mixed&#8208;valence [2Fe&#8722;2C] complex 4 possesses a low&#8208;spin ground state yet displays strong valence delocalization as evident by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduced [2Fe&#8722;C] complex 5 displays a class&#8208;III valence&#8208;delocalized ground state that is supported by magnetometry, vis&#8208;NIR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
The carbide ligand in the iron&#8211;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) in nitrogenase bridges iron atoms in different oxidation states, yet it is difficult to discern its ability to mediate magnetic exchange interactions due to the structural complexity of the cofactor. Here, we describe two mixed&#8208;valent diiron complexes with C&#8208;based ketenylidene bridging ligands, and compare the carbon bridges with the more familiar sulfur bridges. The ground state of the [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)2]+ complex with two carbon bridges (4) is S=
, and it is valence delocalized on the M&#246;ssbauer timescale with a small thermal barrier for electron hopping that stems from the low Fe&#8722;C force constant. In contrast, one&#8208;electron reduction of the [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)] complex with one carbon bridge (2) affords a mixed&#8208;valence species with a high&#8208;spin ground state (S=
), and the Fe&#8722;Fe distance contracts by 1&#8197;&#197;. Spectroscopic, magnetic, and computational studies of the latter reveal an Fe&#8722;Fe bonding interaction that leads to complete valence delocalization. Analysis of near&#8208;IR intervalence charge transfer transitions in 5 indicates a very large double exchange constant (B) in the range of 780&#8211;965&#8197;cm&#8722;1. These results show that carbon bridges are extremely effective at stabilizing valence delocalized ground states in mixed&#8208;valent iron dimers.

         <title>Highly Scalable and Inherently Safer Preparation of Di, Tri and Tetra Nitrate Esters Using Continuous Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient continuous flow O&#8208;nitration of aliphatic polyols was developed. Industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups were synthesized. Examples include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propanediol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt;90&#8201;% in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL reactor volume.







Abstract
Nitrate esters are important organic compounds having wide application in energetic materials, medicines and fuel additives. They are synthesized through nitration of aliphatic polyols. But the process safety challenges associated with nitration reaction makes the production process complicated and economically unviable. Herein, we have developed a continuous flow process wherein polyol and nitric acid are reacted in a microreactor to produce nitrate ester continuously. Our developed process is inherently safer and efficient. The process was optimized for industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups. Substrates include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt;90&#8201;% in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL of reactor volume.

         <title>Photoreduction of Anthracenes Catalyzed by peri&#8208;Xanthenoxanthene: a Scalable and Sustainable Birch&#8208;Type Alternative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclability with efficiency: Photocatalyzed &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction of acenes by using peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX). We present a novel method for reducing various full&#8208;carbon acenes using visible blue light and PXX as a photocatalyst. By attaching PXX to PDMS beads, we achieve catalyst recyclability without compromising efficiency. We also demonstrate continuous&#8208;flow reduction in a microreactor, which enhances the sustainability and scalability of this heterogenous phase strategy.







Abstract
The typical Birch reduction transforms arenes into cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes by using alkali metals, an alcohol as a proton source, and an amine as solvent. Capitalizing on the strong photoreductive properties of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX), herein we report the photocatalyzed &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction of acenes by employing visible blue light irradiation at room temperature in the presence of air. Upon excitation at 405 or 460&#8197;nm in the presence of a mixture of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and trifluoromethanesulfonimide (HNTf2) in DMSO, PXX photocatalyzes the selective reduction of full&#8208;carbon acene derivatives (24&#8211;75&#8201;%). Immobilization of PXX onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) beads (PXX&#8208;PDMS) allowed the use of the catalyst in heterogeneous batch reactions, giving 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene in high yield (68&#8201;%). The catalyst could easily be recovered and reused, with no notable drop in performance observed after five reaction cycles. Integration of the PXX&#8208;PDMS beads into a microreactor enabled the reduction of acenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, thereby validating the sustainability and scalability of this heterogeneous&#8208;phase approach.

         <title>Achieving the Reverse Intersystem Crossing in Chalcone Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor System through Down&#8208;Conversion of Triplet Exciton</title>

The graphical abstract depicts two reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) pathways through the Jablonski diagram: the traditional thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) channel on the left with yellow sunny background and a new, cold rISC pathway on the right in blue.







Abstract
In recent years, understanding the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has become the primary choice for designing high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;cost, metal&#8208;free organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we propose a strategically designed chalcone based donor&#8208;acceptor system, where intensification of delayed fluorescence with decrease in temperature (300&#8197;K to 100&#8197;K) is observed; the theoretical investigations of electronic states and orbital characters uncovered a new cold rISC pathway in donor&#8208;acceptor system, where rISC occurs through the down&#8208;conversation of higher triplet exciton (from T3) to lowest singlet state (S1), having negative energy splitting, thus no thermal energy is required. The comprehensive research described herein might open&#8208;up new avenues in donor&#8208;acceptor system over the conventional up&#8208;convention of triplet exciton and demonstrates that not necessarily all delayed fluorescence are thermally activated (TADF).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Access to Boron&#8208;Doped Fused Heterocycles via Domino Cyclization of Bis&#8208;Diazidoboranes with Isonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room temperature domino cyclization reaction of bis&#8208;diazidoboranes with isonitriles was reported for the first time. This one&#8208;step reaction leads to complex boron&#8208;doped fused heterocycles and provides a new strategy for the construction of boron&#8208;doped heterocyclic systems.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped fused heterocycles have shown great potential in the field of functional materials. This study reports on the synthesis of a new class of bis&#8208;diazidoboranes and the discovery of their cycloaddition reaction with isonitriles.

     alt="One-Pot Access to Boron-Doped Fused Heterocycles via Domino Cyclization of Bis-Diazidoboranes with Isonitrile"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The room temperature domino cyclization&lt;/b&gt; reaction of bis-diazidoboranes with isonitriles was reported for the first time. This one-step reaction leads to complex boron-doped fused heterocycles and provides a new strategy for the construction of boron-doped heterocyclic systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boron-doped fused heterocycles have shown great potential in the field of functional materials. This study reports on the synthesis of a new class of bis-diazidoboranes and the discovery of their cycloaddition reaction with isonitriles. Triply fused boron-doped heterocyclic compounds were constructed in a one-pot process through a domino cycloaddition, providing an effective route for constructing complex boron-doped heterocyclic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Determination of the Handedness of Urea Inclusion Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea inclusion compounds (UICs) are chiral. Sectored chiral domains of UICs, as depicted here, were used to finally establish the correlation between the absolute structures of the UICs and the optical rotation, showcasing the absolute structure determination capability of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction with light atoms only containing samples. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Wang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302217).

         <title>Generation and Application of Homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diboryl Radicals via Diboron&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Vinyl Cyclopropanes: cis&#8208;Diastereoselective Borylative Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;centered radicals stabilized by adjacent boron atoms are underexplored reaction intermediates in organic synthesis. We report the development of vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs) as a versatile source of previously unknown homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals via thiyl radical catalyzed diboron&#8208;directed ring opening. These diboryl stabilized radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. In contrast to the trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of cis&#8208;cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The cis&#8208;stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid framework containing the diboron group. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one&#8208;pot VCP ring&#8208;opening, cycloaddition&#8208;oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mechanism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity. To our knowledge, these are the first examples of the use of geminal diboryl group as an activator of VCP ring opening and cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Dodecaborates by Mild and Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of B&#8208;C Bonds with Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic molecules have recently received great interest due to their unique properties, which give access to their implementation in biological and material sciences. Herein, a new synthetic approach for the direct&#8208;linkage of the purely inorganic dodecaborate cluster to organic building blocks through B&#8208;C bond is established, using boronic acids as functional groups on the organic moiety, reacting under Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling conditions with iodo&#8208;undecahydridododecaborate. The choices of ligand (DavePhos) and solvent (N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for electron&#8208;poor, CD3CN for electron&#8208;rich groups) are essential for the successful coupling. Ultimately, the newly described methodology is found to be functional&#8208;group tolerant covering a wide spectrum of substrates including electron&#8208;poor arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with Carborane&#8208;integrated Immunoliposomes Prepared via an Exchanging Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising modality for cancer treatment because of its minimal invasiveness. To maximize the therapeutic benefits of BNCT, the development of efficient platforms for the delivery of boron agents is indispensable. Here, we prepared carborane&#8208;integrated immunoliposomes via an exchanging reaction to achieve HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted BNCT. The conjugation of an anti&#8208;HER&#8208;2 antibody to carborane&#8208;integrated liposomes successfully endowed these liposome with targeting properties toward HER&#8208;2&#8208;overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells (SK&#8208;OV3); the resulting BNCT activity toward SK&#8208;OV3 cells obtained using the current immunoliposomal system was 14&#8208;fold that of the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex, which is a clinically available boron agent. Moreover, the growth of spheroids treated with our system followed by thermal neutron irradiation was significantly suppressed compared with treatment with the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual strategies with anion/cation co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) are widely used as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high specific capacity, high operating voltage and low cost. However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3 mAh g&#8211;1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 C, and 87.23% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32&#8208;, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co&#8208;doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and no electron spin barrier leap effect at the Fermi level. In addition, the lithium carbonate coating significantly inhibits the occurrence of interfacial side reactions of LLOs. This work provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of LLOs with higher electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Lysine Crotonyl&#8208;Mimic Probe to Covalently Identify H3K27Cr Interacting Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancement of cysteine reactivity of crotonylated lysine (Kcr) in thiol&#8208;Michael addition by replacing the amide bond with an ester bond is reported. The H3g27Cr probe identified the known H3K27Cr&#8208;binding protein HDAC1, as well as the unknown protein STAT3, as potential binders of H3K27Cr in a possibly complex manner. A specific crotonyl group aimed at identifying newer Kcr&#8208;binding interactomes is reported.







Abstract
Histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is one newly discovered acylation modification and regulates numerous pathophysiological processes. The binding affinity between Kcr and its interacting proteins is generally weak, which makes it difficult to effectively identify Kcr&#8208;interacting partners. Changing the amide of crotonyl to an ester increased reactivity with proximal cysteines and retained specificity for Kcr antibody. The probe &#8220;H3g27Cr&#8221; was designed by incorporating the ester functionality into a H3K27 peptide. Using this probe, multiple Kcr&#8208;interacting partners including STAT3 were successfully identified, and this has not been reported previously. Further experiments suggested that STAT3 possibly could form complexes with Histone deacetylase HDACs to downregulate the acetylation and crotonylation of Histone H3K27. Our unique design provided intriguing tools to further explore Kcr&#8208;interacting proteins and elucidate their working mechanisms.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals at Chiral&#8208;Encoded Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys are used as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, illustrated by the enantioselective hydrogenation adrenalone, leading to the desired epinephrine stereoisomer as a model compound with up to 95&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. Although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts to obtain highly pure chiral compounds, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which were applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8722;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine&#8208;tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials were also successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces for the first time.

         <title>Behavior of a Dynamic Covalent Library Driven by Combined Pd(II) and Biphasic Effectors for Metal Transport between Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(II) acts as a chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in a biphasic system. The introduction of Pd(II) leads to a significant increase in the constituent that is best suited for a transfer of Pd(II) into the organic phase. This study introduces a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by utilizing extractant species generated in&#8197;situ by the DCL.







Abstract
This work reports the effect of Pd(II) as chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in biphasic systems (water/chloroform). The constituents of the DCL are self&#8208;built and distributed in the two phases, two of them are lipophilic enough to play the role of a carrier agent that may transfer Pd(II) from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Upon addition of Pd(II), the DCL of components exhibits a strong amplification of the constituent that is the most adapted to stabilize Pd(II) in chloroform as well as its agonist in water. This evolution is driven by the combination of the interaction of the DCL with Pd(II) and the presence of the two phases. This study paves the way to a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by means of adaptive extractant species generated in&#8197;situ by a DCL.

         <title>Photoisomerisation of Exo&#8208;Imine Complexes and the Role of MECP in the Reverse Thermal Equilibrium: An Experimental and DFT Computational Investigation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exo&#8208;imine complexes have been synthesised and shown to behave as molecular switches. Irradiation with visible light converts the more stable to the less stable form (usually trans to cis). The reverse process is thermally activated. DFT calculations show the important role of a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) in the thermal isomerisation.







Abstract
Complexes [MCl2Cp*]2 (M=Ir, Rh), [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and [Ir(C^N)2Cl]2 (HC^N=a, phenylpyridine ; b, phenylpyrazole,) react with imine ligands derived from &#959;&#8208;aminophenol to yield complexes with an exocyclic C=N bond which has a cis or trans configuration. The trans isomer is favoured except for sterically crowded complexes Cp*M (M=Ir, Rh) when the imine has a mesityl substituent, for which the cis isomer is favoured. The complexes undergo photoisomerisation in visible light but revert back to the original isomer over time or when heated. The rate of the thermal reverse isomerisation depends on the imine substituent and the metal fragment. DFT calculations correctly reproduce the favoured isomer and suggest that the reverse isomerisation occurs by a rehybridisation at the N atom as found in organic imines. In addition, a triplet state, thermally accessible by a Minimum Energy Crossing Point (MECP) provides a low energy pathway for reverse isomerisation in the case of the half&#8208;sandwich complexes.

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 by a Bifunctional PC(sp3)P Iridium(III) Pincer Complex Equipped with Tertiary Amine as a Functional Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of CO2 under molecular hydrogen by a fully characterized Ir(III) pincer complex is described. The unique biomimetic second coordination sphere functionality is investigated both empirically and computationally shows the hydrogen activation step to proceed in room temperature.







Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage in the form of stable and mostly harmless chemical substances such as formic acid (FA) is a cornerstone of a fossil fuels&#8208;free economy. In the past, we have reported a primary amine&#8208;functionalized bifunctional iridium(III)&#8208;PC(sp3)P pincer complex as a mild and chemoselective catalyst for the additive&#8208;free decomposition of neat formic acid. In this manuscript, we report on the successful application of a redesigned complex bearing tertiary amine functionality as a catalyst for mild hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid. The catalyst demonstrates TON up to 6&#215;104 and TOF up to 1.7&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1. In addition to the practical value of the catalyst, experimental and computational mechanistic studies provide the rationale for the design of improved next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries by Coating the Separator with a Cation&#8208;Selective Polymer Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer is synthesized and then coated on one side of the polypropylene separator in a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, which can effectively obstruct the shuttling of negatively charged soluble polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsion of fixed anions on the backbone of the polymer with no influence on the passage of lithium&#8208;ion, thus remarkably elevating the battery's cycle performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are believed to possess the feasibility to power electric vehicles in the future ascribed to the competitive energy density. However, soluble polysulfides continuously shuttle between the sulfur electrode and lithium anode across the separator, which dramatically impairs the battery's capacity. Herein, the surface of a polypropylene separator (PP film) is successfully modified with a delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer layer to suppress the transport of polysulfides. In principle, since bis&#8208;sulfonimide anions groups on the backbone of the polymer are immobilized, only cations can pass through the polymer layer. Furthermore, plenty of ethoxy chains in the polymer can facilitate lithium&#8208;ion mobility. Consequently, in addition to obstructing the movement of negatively charged polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsive force of fixed anions, the coated multi&#8208;functional layer on the PP film also guarantees the smooth conduction of lithium ions. The investigations demonstrate that the battery with the pristine PP film only delivers 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C with a high capacity fading rate of 60.9&#8201;%. By contrast, the polymer&#8208;coated sample can release 409.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the identical test condition and the capacity fading rate sharply declines to 43.2&#8201;%, illustrating superior cycle performance.

         <dc:description>Studies of the supramolecular chemistry of iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides have been confined to non&#8208;polar media until now. To overcome that limitation, an iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide was derivatized with a primary alcohol group; the compound is soluble in polar solvents and stable in acidic to neutral aqueous media. Nickel (II) and iron (II) form macrocyclic complexes with six molecules of that isotellurazole N&#8208;oxide in a hitherto not&#8208;observed macrocyclic arrangement defined by CTe&#8230;O chalcogen bonds and &#954;6&#8208;O bound to the metal ion. This behaviour is in sharp contrast with the &#954;n&#8208;Te (n = 1,2,4) complexes formed by soft metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Dialanes(4) of Al2Mes4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized dialanes Al2Mes4 as well as first investigations concerning the reactivity of these compounds are reported. The synthesis of these compounds proceeds via the Mesityl&#8208;substituted alanes (NHC)&#183;AlHMes2 (NHC = IMeMe3, IiPrMe4) and iodo&#8208;alanes (NHC)&#183;AlIMes2 (NHC = IMeMe5, IiPrMe6). Metallic reduction of 5 and 6 afforded the new NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes (NHC)2&#183;Al2Mes4 (NHC = IMeMe7, IiPrMe8). The NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane Al2Mes4. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#183;Al2Mes47 towards small molecules confirm this, as 7 shows controlled and selective reactions with several substrates. Reaction with CuCl leads to oxidation of the dialane and formation of (IMeMe)&#183;AlClMes210, reactions with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and tBu&#8208;N=C=S, respectively, gave the chalcogenide&#8208;bridged dimers ((IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2)2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;E (E= O 11, S 12), and reaction with acetylene afforded the dimetallaacetylide ((IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2)2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C) 13.</dc:description>

         <title>Capture&#8208;SELEX of DNA Aptamers for Sulforhodamine B and Fluorescein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While many dye binding aptamers have been reported, most of them were for light&#8208;up aptamers that can significantly enhance the quantum yield of fluorophores. Sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was used as a target previously to select both DNA and RNA aptamers, and the DNA aptamer was a G&#8208;quadruplex that can bind to a number of rhodamine analogs. In addition, the previous selections were performed by immobilizing the target molecules. In this work, we used the library immobilization method to respectively select aptamers for SRhB and fluorescein. The SRhB aptamer has a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex structure with a Kd of 1.0 &#181;M measured from isothermal titration calorimetry. Upon titration of the aptamer, the fluorescence of SRhB increased 2.5&#8208;fold, and this aptamer does not require Mg2+ for binding. Rhodamine B has even tighter binding suggesting binding through the xanthene moiety of the dyes. No binding was detected for fluorescein. For the fluorescein selection, a dominant aptamer sequence with a Kd of 147 &#181;M was obtained. This study provides two new aptamers for two important fluorophores that can be used to study aptamer&#8208;based separation, dye detection and catalysis. Comparison of these aptamers also provide insights into the effect of functional groups on aptamer binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Stepwise Functionalization of the Pyridazine Scaffold by Using Thio&#8208;Substituted Pyridazine Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a regioselective tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalization of the pyridazine scaffold using two readily available building blocks: 3&#8208;(butylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine and 3,4&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine by performing selective metalations with TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and catalyst&#8208;tuned cross&#8208;coupling reactions with arylzinc halides. Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N&#8208;heterocycles such as thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridazines and 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazines.

Geometry of the first excited S1 state has been obtained for the bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes that possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core. The elongated N&#8722;N bond in the S1 state and thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation free energies hold great promise for N2 &#960;&#8208;photoactivation and protonation.







Abstract
Bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes have served as the platform for photochemical N2 activation, mainly for the N&#8722;N cleavage. However, the alternate N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation route has remained largely unexplored. This study strengthens the notion of weakening the N&#8722;N bond through the population of &#960;* orbital upon electronic excitation from the ground to the first excited state using four prototypical complexes based on Fe (1), Mo (2), and Ru (3,4). The complexes 1&#8211;4 possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core, which was earlier postulated to play a central role in the N2 photoactivation. Vertical electronic excitation of the highest oscillator strength involves transitions to the N&#8722;N &#960;*&#8208;based acceptor orbital (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) in complexes 1&#8211;4. This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (1MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full&#8208;sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation with &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8722;N bond and bent &#8736;MNN angle in the photoexcited S1 state of 1&#8211;4 resemble their radical&#8208; and di&#8208;anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation in the S1 excited state.

         <title>Synthesis and VCD Spectroscopic Characterization of a Series of Azacryptands from a Chiral Valine&#8208;Based Derivative of Tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce three C3&#8208;symmetric azacryptands with chiral valine&#8208;based TREN headgroups. Their VCD spectroscopic characterization reveals that the computed lowest energy conformers of all three azacryptands are not favored in solution phase and that they prefer a collapsed conformation.







Abstract
Utilizing experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, we explored the conformational preferences of a series of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric octaazacryptands with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;amine head groups derived from valine. While the spectra of the smallest azacryptand with p&#8208;phenyl linkers and its elongated derivative with p&#8208;biphenyls linker were found to match well with the computed spectra, the computed conformational preferences of the m&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;based azacryptand did not seem to reflect the conformations dominating in chloroform solution. A detailed analysis revealed that structural changes resulting in a collapsed cage structure gave a notably better match with the experiment. It could subsequently be concluded from the VCD analysis, that the octaazacryptands prefer a collapsed structure, which is not predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the global minimum structures. These findings are expected to have consequences also for future studies on inclusion complexes of such azacryptands.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Dimer of an Alcohol with the Derived Carboxylic Acid Triggering their Sorption by Nanoporous&#8208;crystalline PPO Films</title>

Poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO) films do not absorb benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA) separately from dilute aqueous solutions while exhibiting selective uptake of a BAL/BA equimolar compound, if BA is obtained by oxidizing BAL. Quantitative FTIR evaluations and structural information indicate uptake of a BAL/BA hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer in PPO intrahelical crystalline channels.







Abstract
Films exhibiting nanoporous&#8208;crystalline (NC) phases of poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO), which are highly effective to absorb apolar organic guest molecules, are also able to absorb polar molecules (like alcohols and carboxylic acids) but only from concentrated organic solutions. NC PPO films, which do not absorb alcohols and carboxylic acids from diluted aqueous solutions, exhibits a huge uptake (even above 30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA), if BA is obtained by spontaneous room temperature oxidation of BAL in aqueous solution. This phenomenon is rationalized by an easy uptake, mainly by the PPO intrahelical crystalline empty channels, of a BAL/BA 1/1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer. This huge uptake of BAL/BA dimer by NC PPO films, which is also fast for films exhibiting the orientation of the crystalline helices perpendicular to the film plane (c&#8869; orientation), can be exploited for purification of water from BAL, when present in traces. High and fast sorption of a hydrogen bonded dimer and negligible sorption of the two separate compounds is possibly unprecedented for absorbent materials.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Crabtree&#8208;Pfaltz Hydrogenation of Olefins &#8208; An Interplay of Experimentation and Quantum Chemical Computation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic hydrogenation of unfunctionalized, highly substituted olefins once was a difficult task that was solved by Crabtree with his iridium catalyst that was further improved by Pfaltz and others. Mechanistic aspects of this type of reactions have been elucidated by an interplay of experiment and quantum chemical calculations; nevertheless, open questions exist, which require further effort particularly by theoretical chemists.







Abstract
Introduction of Crabtree's iridium&#8208;based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hydrogenation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&#8722; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to numerous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic details posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et&#8197;al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed IrI/IrIII catalytic cycle by a novel IrIII/IrV cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to describe a fascinating interplay of experiments and quantum chemical calculations for an important synthetic method.

&lt;p&gt;Introduction of Crabtree's iridium-based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hydrogenation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to numerous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic details posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et&#8197;al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed Ir&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle by a novel Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/Ir&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to describe a fascinating interplay of experiments and quantum chemical calculations for an important synthetic method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interaction Between the Transferrin Protein and Plutonium (and Thorium), What's New?</title>

Metalloprotein: With a toolbox of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, this work sheds light on the binding interaction of plutonium and thorium (early actinides at oxidation state +IV) with iron transport transferrin protein and its tertiary structure.







Abstract
Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with metals other than Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics. We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV&#8208;Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M=Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M&#8722;O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of Deferoxamine&#8208;B (DFOB) in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf. Data suggest that the structure of the protein is more ellipsoidal than spherical, with a flattened oblate form. From this data, the following order of conformation size might be considered:holoTf&lt;M2Tf (M=Th, Pu)&lt;apoTf&lt;M2Tf&#8208;DFOB (M=Fe, Th, Pu).

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>

In silico designed N&#8208;modified tripeptide PEP1 (yellow) imitating TIN2 peptide (green) can modulate interaction of TIN2 with TRF1 telomeric shelterin protein (gray) as shown in the figure and in consequence cause biological effects in cancer cells leading to senescence.







Abstract
In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed &#8220;peptidomimetic&#8221; molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in&#8197;vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminium Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New cationic aluminium complexes with terminal alkoxy substituents (&#8722;OMe and &#8722;OtBu) are reported; these showed markedly higher Lewis acidity than the known hydride and methyl analogues, as evident from their Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test, NBO analysis and hydride ion affinity calculations. These complexes activate triethylsilane and are good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and alkene.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;supported aluminium complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L=[HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further used as synthons to generate the fascinating cationic aluminium alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#956;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron&#8208;demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminium halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.

         <title>Synthesis of Black Phosphorene Quantum Dots from Red Phosphorus
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorene quantum dots can now be made at remarkably low cost in a simple two step process. Ball milling cheap abundant red phosphorus creates quantu dots trapped in bulk, which can then be freed by etching the surrounding amorphous phosphorus with lithium electride solution.







Abstract
Black phosphorene quantum dots (BPQDs) are most commonly derived from high&#8208;cost black phosphorus, while previous syntheses from the low&#8208;cost red phosphorus (Pred) allotrope are highly oxidised. Herein, we present an intrinsically scalable method to produce high quality BPQDs, by first ball&#8208;milling Pred to create nanocrystalline Pblack and subsequent reductive etching using lithium electride solvated in liquid ammonia. The resultant ~25&#8197;nm BPQDs are crystalline with low oxygen content, and spontaneously soluble as individualized monolayers in tertiary amide solvents, as directly imaged by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. This new method presents a scalable route to producing quantities of high quality BPQDs for academic and industrial applications.

         <title>5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as a Functional Platform for Peptide Stapling and Multicyclisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>

We introduce 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as a widely applicable scaffold for the stapling and multicyclisation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides. A robust and peptide&#8208;compatible Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution between aromatic fluorides and cysteine thiols was performed with a library of peptides, leading to different cyclic species &#8211; one of which was biologically tested &#8211; and offering relevant synthetic insights.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated aromatic reagents readily react with thiolates via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and provide excellent scaffolds for peptide cyclisation. Here we report a robust and versatile platform for peptide stapling and multicyclisation templated by 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin, opening the door to the next generation of functional scaffolds for 3D peptide architectures. We demonstrate that stapling and multicyclisation occurs with a range of non&#8208;protected peptides under peptide&#8208;compatible conditions, exhibiting chemoselectivity and wide&#8208;applicability. Peptides containing two cysteine residues are readily stapled, and the remaining perfluoroaryl groups permit the introduction of a second peptide in a modular fashion to access bicyclic peptides. Similarly, peptides with more than two cysteine residues can afford multicyclic products containing up to three peptide &#8216;loops&#8217;. Finally, we demonstrate that a porphyrin&#8208;templated stapled peptide containing the Skin Penetrating and Cell Entering (SPACE) peptide affords a skin cell penetrating conjugate with intrinsic fluorescence.

         <title>EPR Sensing of a Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the use of aza&#8208;crown ethers containing a stable nitroxide acting as selective sensor of inorganic and organic cations is described. The radical is deeply involved in the coordination complex generating peculiar EPR spectral pattern also depending on non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of the metal cation. The wheel was employed also in the preparation of a rotaxane structure.







Abstract
New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8211;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to the non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8901; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.

         <title>Unravelling the Mystery of COVID&#8208;19 Pathogenesis: Spike Protein and Cu Can Synergize to Trigger ROS Production</title>

How COVID&#8208;19 damage DNA: Severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules in COVID&#8208;19&#8208;infected lungs has been reported. Our study shows that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein fragments coordinate Cu(II) ions, forming three&#8208;nitrogen complexes in the lung environment. Using various methods, we demonstrated that these complexes generate ROS, leading to single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand DNA breaks.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, highlighting the need to understand how the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus damages the lungs in order to develop effective treatments. Recent research has shown that patients with COVID&#8208;19 experience severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules. We propose that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection involves an interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein. We tested two peptide fragments, Ac&#8208;ELDKYFKNH&#8208;NH2 (L1) and Ac&#8208;WSHPQFEK&#8208;NH2 (L2), derived from the spike protein of the Wuhan strain and the &#946; variant, respectively, and found that they bind Cu(II) ions and form a three&#8208;nitrogen complexes at lung pH. Our research demonstrates that these complexes trigger the overproduction of ROS, which can break both DNA strands and transform DNA into its linear form. Using A549&#8197;cells, we demonstrated that ROS overproduction occurs in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein in the development of lung damage and may aid in the development of therapeutic procedures.

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal conjugation has the potential to improve the speciation and cellular distribution of quinolines and subsequently broadening their spectrum of action as antimalarial drugs for multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Here, we provide an in&#8208;depth investigation of the chemistry and pharmacology of metal&#8208;quinoline complexes.







Abstract
Malaria is the one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Chemically, quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II)&#8208; and gold(I)&#8208;containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized, and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline&#8208;metal bond. RuII&#8208; and AuI&#8208;AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle as assayed in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal&#8208;AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle; this can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. Altogether, these findings indicate that metal coordination with antimalarial quinolines is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metal conjugation&lt;/b&gt; has the potential to improve the speciation and cellular distribution of quinolines and subsequently broadening their spectrum of action as antimalarial drugs for multiple stages of the &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; life cycle. Here, we provide an in-depth investigation of the chemistry and pharmacology of metal-quinoline complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria is the one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Chemically, quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II)- and gold(I)-containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized, and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline-metal bond. Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;- and Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; life cycle as assayed in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal-AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle; this can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. Altogether, these findings indicate that metal coordination with antimalarial quinolines is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Straightforward Synthesis of Halopyridine Aldehydes via Diaminomethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridines featuring two or more halogen atoms react with silylformamidine via insertion into the most acidic C&#8722;H bond either at the &#947; or &#946;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. Their hydrolysis gave aldehydes. The reaction proceeds via H&#8208;abstraction from pyridines by the strong base&#8208;carbenic form of silylformamidine followed by formation of C&#8722;C bond between the formamidinium cation and the pyridine anion.







Abstract
A novel two&#8208;step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine Me3SiC(=NMe)NMe2 (1) under catalyst&#8208;free conditions was developed. A series of all possible 18&#8197;fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with 1 existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form Me2NC(:)N(Me)SiMe3 (1&#8242;). Among them, 12&#8197;fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8722;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5&#8208;Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by 1&#8242; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of 1&#8242; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three&#8208;membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>

A robust sensor: A robust methodology for the fabrication of electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor biosensors is presented. Single walled carbon nanotubes are hybridized with bovine serum albumin allowing the transistor fabrication from aqueous solution. The sensor functionality is demonstrated for the detection of cortisol in solution after immobilization of antibodies on the gate surface. Analysis of the signal allows the extraction of binding parameters.







Abstract
Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of N,N&#8208;difunctionalized anilines into formamides derivatives (up to 89&#8201;% yield) under mild operative conditions is described herein. In this reaction, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) acts as a robust and fully recyclable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst that was easily recovered and reused up to five times without any significant drop in yield.







Abstract
The use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches, is reported herein. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as an oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption, which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2 via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield).

         <title>The Structure of Maneb, An Important Manganese&#8208;Containing Bis(dithiocarbamate) Fungicide</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular structure of Maneb determined: Over 70&#8197;years after patent publication, the mystery of the structure of the surprisingly stable manganese(II)&#8208;containing ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide, which is extensively used in agriculture, has finally been solved.







Abstract
Maneb is a manganese(II)&#8208;containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is, however, mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial, and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.

         <title>Acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Amide Supramolecular Synthon for Tuning Amino Acid&#8208;Based Hydrogels&#8217; Properties</title>

The self&#8208;assembly of the well&#8208;known efficient gelator N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine, in the presence of a strong hydrogen bond&#8208;forming non&#8208;gelator, like benzamide, is driven by the same supramolecular interactions both in the crystal and hydrogel phase. This matching could open the way to a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach for the design of multicomponent amino acid hydrogels with tunable strength and properties.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives are gaining relevance for several applications in the materials and biomedical fields. In the challenging attempt to predict or tune their properties, we selected Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine (1) as a model efficient gelator, and studied its self&#8208;assembly in the presence of benzamide (2), a non&#8208;gelator able to form strong hydrogen bonds with the amino acid carboxylic group. Equimolar mixtures of 1 and 2 in organic solvents afforded a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;crystal thanks to the formation of an acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amide heterodimeric supramolecular synthon. The same synthon occurred in the transparent gels formed by mixing the two components in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in aqueous media, as revealed by structural, spectroscopic, and thermal characterizations performed on both the co&#8208;crystal powder and the lyophilized hydrogel. These findings revealed the possibility of modulating the properties of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogels by involving the gelator in the formation of a co&#8208;crystal. Such a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach is shown also to be useful for the time&#8208;delayed release of suitable bioactive molecules, when involved as hydrogel coformers.

A novel route using Schreiner thiourea mediated organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with diverse azides is devised to furnish high yield of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl glycoconjugates. The method has some notable features including metal&#8208;free, straightforward, acid&#8208;free, excellent regioselectivity operationally simple, wide substrate scope and high yielding. The Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea organocatalyst, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of diverse 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields with excellent regioselectivity.

         <title>Sheltering Mono&#8208;P&#8208;Ligated Metal Complexes in Porous Polystyrene Monolith: Effect of Aryl Pendant Stabilizers on Catalytic Durability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208;ligated phosphine&#8208;metal complexes on porous polystyrene monoliths exhibited high catalytic durabilities by screening the electronic properties of aryl pendant groups. The quantitative analyses of interactions between aryl pendant groups and metal center revealed the importance of moderate stabilization for long&#8208;term catalysis in continuous&#8208;flow cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Metal centers that can generate coordinatively unsaturated metals in accessible and stable states have been developed using synthetic polymers with sophisticated ligand and scaffold designs, which required synthetic efforts. Herein, we report a simple and direct strategy for producing polymer&#8208;supported phosphine&#8208;metal complexes, which stabilizes mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated metals by modulating the electronic properties of the aryl pendant groups in the polymer platform. A three&#8208;fold vinylated PPh3 was copolymerized with a styrene derivative and a cross&#8208;linker to produce a porous polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid monolith. Based on the Hammett substituent constants, the electronic properties of styrene derivatives were modulated and incorporated into the polystyrene backbone to stabilize the mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated Pd complex via Pd&#8208;arene interactions. Through NMR, TEM, and comparative catalytic studies, the polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid, which induces selective mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligation and moderate Pd&#8208;arene interactions, demonstrated high catalytic durability for the cross&#8208;coupling of chloroarenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions.

         <title>Heterocyclic Merging of Stereochemically Diverse Chiral Piperazines and Morpholines with Indazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study accomplishes the heterocyclic merging of piperazines and morpholines with indazoles, successfully produced 20 distinct regio and stereochemically diverse indazolo&#8208;piperazine and indazolo&#8208;morpholine derivatives. This process could possibly be expanded to provide an efficient synthetic route that allows stereochemical and regiochemical variation in the assembly. We hypothesize that merging will afford compounds with biological activities that are unique from those of the simpler scaffolds that make up their merged structure.&gt;







Abstract
We report a heterocyclic merging approach to construct novel indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines. Starting from chiral diamines and amino alcohols, novel regiochemically (1,3 and 1,4) and stereochemically diverse (relative and absolute) cohorts of indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines were obtained within six or seven steps. The key transformations involved are a Smiles rearrangement to generate the indazole core structure and a late&#8208;stage Michael addition to build the piperazine and morpholine heterocycles. We further explored additional vector diversity by incorporating substitutions on the indazole aromatic ring, generating a total of 20 unique, enantiomerically pure heterocyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imidazole&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters have been synthesized and characterized. The electrochemiluminescence efficiency of such compounds is dictated by the presence of electrochemical reversible redox processes rather than by their photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state lifetimes. Moreover, the imidazole moiety can be alkylated enabling the insertion of a derivatizable group.







Abstract
A family of novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has been synthesized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we kept the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, fixed and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as co&#8208;reactant and co&#8208;reactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceeded the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 by up to 28&#8197;times with benzoyl peroxide and 38&#8197;times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of the redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields or excited&#8208;state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depends on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated, thus allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, and enabling practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A family of novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has been synthesized by a straightforward and metal-free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we kept the acceptor moiety, 4-(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazol-1-yl)benzonitrile, fixed and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as co-reactant and co-reactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceeded the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by up to 28&#8197;times with benzoyl peroxide and 38&#8197;times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of the redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields or excited-state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depends on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated, thus allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, and enabling practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a lithium oxonitridophosphate double salt synthesized from P3N5 and Li2O in ampoule synthesis. The structure consists of phosphate and diphosphate motifs and exhibits a severe disorder in the diphosphate unit. NMR and vibrational spectroscopy methods give additional information concerning the composition of oxygen and nitrogen. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x, was obtained in an ampoule synthesis from P3N5 and Li2O. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P
 with a=5.125(2), b=9.888(5), c=10.217(5) &#197;, &#945;=70.30(2), &#946;=76.65(2), &#947;=77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Decoupled Water Electrolyzer Operating at Simulated Fluctuating Renewables with Tri&#8208;Functional NiCo&#8208;P Electrode</title>

A membrane&#8208;free decoupled alkaline water electrolyzer was constructed using a graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate material as the tri&#8208;functional electrode, which significantly improves the flexibility of water splitting.







Abstract
Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we designed a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system by using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by a one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.

         <title>In silico Investigation of the Thermochemistry and Photoactivity of Pyruvic Acid in an Aqueous Solution of NaCl</title>

Ab&#8197;initio study of the hydrated and non&#8208;hydrated forms of pyruvate in NaCl aqueous solution emphasizes the influence of sodium on the chemical equilibrium of hydration and photoactivity of the anion.







Abstract
The photochemistry of oxocarboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions, influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab&#8197;initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2&#8197;kJ/mol at 300&#8197;K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+ coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.

         <title>Regiocontrol via Electronics: Insights into a Ru&#8208;Catalyzed, Cu&#8208;Mediated Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Isoquinolones via a C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Cyclopropanols</title>

A Ru&#8208;catalyzed, Cu&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective, C3/C4&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved. The reaction pathway is characterized by open&#8208;shell singlet and triplet energy pathways arising from the bimetallic complex. Regioselectivity arises from the energies of the two states. While the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily afford the unprecedented C(4)&#8208;isomer, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups show an inclination towards the C(3)&#8208;product.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective C(3)/C(4)&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed/Cu(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)&#8208;alkylated products, whereas the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily generate the C(4)&#8208;alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet pathways for the C(3)&#8208; and C(4)&#8208;product formation. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.

&lt;p&gt;A site-selective C(3)/C(4)-alkylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under Ru(II)-catalyzed/Cu(II)-mediated conditions. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron-withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)-alkylated products, whereas the electron-donating groups primarily generate the C(4)-alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet pathways for the C(3)- and C(4)-product formation. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cover Feature: Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminium Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications (Chem. Eur. J. 55/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;stabilized highly electrophilic monomeric aluminium cations with alkoxy substituents have been introduced. The Guttman&#8211;Beckett method and hydride ion affinity calculations affirm that alkoxy groups enhance the electrophilicity of these cations. We also illustrate their catalytic application for reactions such as ether activation, hydrosilylation of alkene and carbonyls. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Singh and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301229). Manu Adhikari&#8216;s background image is gratefully acknowledged.

Meet to defeat: A strategic round&#8208;table meeting has been convened between inorganic chemistry and pharmacology to tackle malaria, one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. As a result, metals have been deliberately conjugated with the antimalarial quinoline Amodiaquine. These metal&#8211;amodiaquine complexes have overcome the limitations of metal&#8208;free quinolines, and light has been shed on their potential as a chemical tool for designing new drugs against malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Colina&#8208;Vegas, D.&#8197;R.&#8197;M. Moreira and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301642).

         <dc:description>
Urea synthesis via an electrocatalytic technique from CO2 and N&#8208;containing feedstocks is a clean and sustainable approach to replace the Haber&#8208;Meiser process, in which the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts is vital to improve the activity and selectivity of urea production.







Abstract
Urea synthesis from abundant CO2 and N&#8208;feedstocks via renewable electricity has attracted increasing interests, offering a promising alternative to the industrial&#8208;applied Haber&#8208;Meiser process. However, the studies toward electrochemical urea production remain scarce and appeal for more research. Herein, in this perspective, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview on the urea electrosynthesis is highlighted and summarized. Firstly, the reaction pathways of urea formation through various feedstocks are comprehensively discussed. Then, we focus on the strategies of materials design to improve C&#8722;N coupling efficiency by identifying the descriptor and understanding the reaction mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and disadvantages in this field are reviewed and some future development directions of electrocatalytic urea synthesis are also prospected. This Minireview aims to promote future investigations of the electrochemical urea synthesis.

         <title>Pinacol Cross&#8208;Coupling Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple sequential addition protocol for the reductive coupling of ketones and aldehydes by a potassium aluminyl grants access to unsymmetrical pinacolate derivatives. Isolation of an aluminium ketyl complex presents evidence for the accessibility of radical species. Product release from the aluminium centre was achieved using an iodosilane, forming the disilylated 1,2&#8208;diol and a neutral aluminium iodide, thereby demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle for pinacol (cross) coupling at an aluminyl anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Coupling of a Diazoalkane Derivative Promoted by a Potassium Aluminyl and Elimination of Dinitrogen to Generate a Reactive Aluminium Ketimide</title>

         <dc:description>The reaction of 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) with the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) affords K[Al(NON)(&#954;N1,N3&#8208;{(fluN2)2})] (1). Structural
analysis shows a near planar 1,4&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9ylidene)tetraazadiide ligand that chelates to the aluminium. The thermally induced elimination of dinitrogen from 1 affords the neutral aluminium ketimide complex, Al(NON)(N=flu)(THF) (2) and the 1,2di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene dianion as the potassium salt, [K2(THF)3][fluN=Nflu] (3). The reaction of 2 with N,N'diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrN=C=NiPr) affords the aluminium guanidinate complex, Al(NON){N(iPr)C(N=CMe2)N(CHflu)} (4), showing a rare example of reactivity at a metal ketimide ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to examine the bonding in the newly formed [(fluN2)2]2&#8211; ligand in 1 and the ketimide bonding in 2. The mechanism leading to the formation of 4 has also been studied using this technique.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes has been instrumental in broadening its application field, allowing especially its use in biological studies. Although numerous covalent and non&#8208;covalent functionalisation methods have been described, the characterisation of the final materials has always been an added challenge. Among the various techniques available, Raman spectroscopy is one of the most widely used to determine the covalent functionalisation of these species. However, Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative technique, and no studies are reported comparing its performance when the same number of functional groups are added but using completely different reactions. In this work, we have experimentally and theoretically studied the functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using two of the most commonly used reactions: 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethylene ylides and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition. The number of groups introduced onto the tubes by these reactions has been determined by different characterisation techniques. The results of this study support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectra are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing functionalisations produced using different reaction types.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the optical properties through hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation: The ODIN case</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN&#8208;EtPh and ODIN&#8208;But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules. By employing a combination of X&#8208;ray and electron crystallography, Absorption and Emission spectroscopy, time resolved fluorescence and ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy (visible and infrared) we unravel the correlation between the structure and light&#8208;matter response, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the polarity of the surrounding environment. Our experimental results and simulations confirm that in polar and good hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor solvents (DMSO), the formation of dimers for ODIN derivatives is strongly inhibited. The presence of a phenyl group linked to the ureidic unit favors the folding of ODIN derivatives (forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond) leading to the stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer excited state which almost completely quenches its fluorescence emission. In solvents with a poor aptitude for forming hydrogen bonds, the formation of dimers is favored which give rise to H aggregates, with a consequent considerable reduction in the fluorescence emission. The urea&#8208;bound phenyl group furtherly stabilize the dimers in chloroform.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibactericidal Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Alkaloid Conjugate and Their Interactions with Biomolecules: A Case of N&#8208;Methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphine derived from natural alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine was used to synthesize half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes. It turned out that they are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whereas the Ir(III) complex was more bactericidal. The potential action mode was proposed, based on the interactions with various biomolecules (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine, and 9&#8208;methyladenine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, glutathione, and ascorbic acid).







Abstract
The phosphine ligand (Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, PNMPEA) obtained by the reaction of the (hydroxymethyl)diphenylphosphine with naturally occurring alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine, was used to synthesize the half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) (Ir(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, IrPNMPEA) and ruthenium(II) (Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, RuPNMPEA) complexes. They were characterized using a vast array of methods, including 1D and 2D NMR, ESI(+)MS spectrometry, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spectroscopy in the UV&#8208;Vis range (absorption, fluorescence) and density functional theory (DFT). The initial antimicrobial activity in&#8197;vitro toward Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains was examined, indicating that both complexes are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, e.&#8201;g., Staphylococcus aureus, where the IrPNMPEA has been more bactericidal compared to RuPNMPEA. Additionally, the interactions of these compounds with various biomolecules, such as DNA (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine (9&#8208;EtG), and 9&#8208;methyladenine (9&#8208;MeA)), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid (Asc) were described. The results showed that both Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes accelerate the oxidation process of NADH, GSH and Asc that appeared to occur by an electron transfer mechanism. Interestingly, only IrPNMPEA leads to the formation of various biomolecule adducts, which can explain its higher activity. Furthermore, RuPNMPEA and IrPNMPEA have been interacting with the DNA through weak noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Hollow Hierarchical FER Zeolite with Improved Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow hierarchical FER zeolite is synthesized through an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted approach without the use of mesoporogens, and exhibits improved catalytic performance in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites are highly&#8208;desired catalysts in the petrochemical industry due to their shorter diffusion length, faster diffusion rate, and better accessibility to active acid sites compared with conventional zeolites. Herein, we report a simple amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted method to synthesize urchin&#8208;like hollow hierarchical FER zeolites with abundant mesopores and macroporous inner cavities. An amino acid (i.&#8201;e. L&#8208;lysine) is used to facilitate the agglomeration of primary gel nanoparticles. The preferential nucleation and crystal growth at the external surfaces together with the lagged crystallization of the inner core of the agglomerates results in the formation of hollow inner cavities after the exhaustion of interior materials. Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure and more accessible acid sites, the hollow hierarchical FER zeolite exhibits improved catalytic performance over the conventional one in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.

         <title>Chiral Dual Core Chromophores Based on Binaphthyl Acrylonitrile Motif with Tunable Dual Emission Bands and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prepared chiral dual core chromophores based on binaphthyl acrylonitrile were shown to have the excellent dual state emissions and tunable dual wavelength emissions. A range of colors could be observed by solvatochromic and mechanochromic effects, and the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application with small color migration was also achieved.







Abstract
Small organic molecules which can emit fluorescence with tunable dual emission bands are significant for fundamental research and broad applications. In this work, two binaphthyl based arylacrylonitrile derivatives with pyrene and triphenylamine unit (BiNp&#8208;Py and BiNp&#8208;TPA) were designed and synthesized, respectively, featuring chiral backbone and dual AIE&#8208;active cyanostyrene&#8208;linked chromophores. Excellent fluorescence emissions in a range of solution and solid states were observed with high quantum yields, indicative of the solvatochromism and mechanochromism. More interestingly, dual emission bands were found and tunable by the water fraction in THF, and speculatively attributed to the balancing of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and locally excited (LE) emission in solution and aggregate states. Furthermore, the potential application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink was also explored, indicating the very low concentration (5&#8197;ppm) for sufficient distinguishable vision and small colour migration (28&#8197;nm) for printing on the filter. The present work provides a new strategy to design organic luminescent structure having widely fluorescent emissions in dual states and a valuable reference for the study of chiral optical materials.

         <title>Switchable Selectivity in the Annulation of o&#8208;Trifluoroacetylanilines and Activated Terminal Alkynes Based on Transition Metal and Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Cu ang Ag catalysis as well as phosphine catalysis, we have developed efficient methods for the synthesis of three different types of CF3&#8208;substituted compounds (quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, and indolines) from the same starting materials such as o&#8208;trifluoroacetylanilines and propiolates.







Abstract
In this work, we have developed selective methods for the synthesis of quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates and quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as well as (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates through copper&#8208;, silver&#8208;, or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of propiolates with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones. The approaches proposed ensure synthesis of substituted quinoline carboxylates and (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates in good yields. Introduction of alkynones into the reaction with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones gives acyl substituted derivatives in good yields.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Nucleobase Modification of Oligodeoxynucleotides by Sonogashira Coupling and Influence of Alkynyl Modifications on the Duplex&#8208;Forming Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification method for oligonucleotides via Sonogashira coupling is developed. This method enables efficient synthesis of various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides and evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. Interestingly, alkynyl&#8208;modification on pyrimidine is less tolerated than on purine in duplex stability.







Abstract
Recently, it was reported that the alkynyl modification of nucleobases mitigates the toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) while maintaining the efficacy. However, the general effect of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability of oligonucleotides (ONs) is unclear. In this study, post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification by Sonogashira coupling in aqueous medium was carried out to efficiently evaluate the physiological properties of various ONs with alkynyl&#8208;modified nucleobases. Although several undesired reactions, including nucleobase cyclization, were observed, various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs were successfully obtained via Sonogashira coupling of ONs containing iodinated nucleobases. Evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs showed that the alkynyl modification of pyrimidine was less tolerated than that of purine, although both the modifications occurred in the major groove of the duplex. These results can be attributed to the bond angle of the alkyne on the pyrimidine and the close proximity of the alkynyl substituents to the phosphodiester backbone. The synthetic method developed in this study may contribute to the screening of the optimal chemical modification of ASO because various alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs that are effective in reducing the toxicity of ASO can be easily synthesized by this method.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of Collinodiene Synthase, a Diterpene Synthase from Streptomyces collinus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 for cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol from Streptomyces collinus and S. iakyrus were investigated. The enzyme from S. collinus produces the new compound collinodiene besides cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and other side products. Isotopic labelling experiments were performed to enlighten the cyclisation mechanism.







Abstract
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 from Streptomyces collinus (ScCotB2) and Streptomyces iakyrus (SiCotB2) were investigated for their products by in&#8197;vitro incubations of the recombinant enzymes with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, followed by compound isolation and structure elucidation by NMR. ScCotB2 produced the new compound collinodiene, besides the canonical CotB2 product cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol, dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene and dolabella&#8208;3,7,12&#8208;triene, while SiCotB2 gave mainly cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and only traces of dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene. The cyclisation mechanism towards the ScCotB2 products and their absolute configurations were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments.

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two covalent organic frameworks with double&#8208;walled linkages were successfully synthesized and exhibited excellent stability when treated with boiling water and basic solutions. Moreover, these double&#8208;walled COFs exhibited remarkable IAST selectivity for favored adsorption of CO2 over N2.







Abstract
Double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, consisting of two same building blocks parallel to each other forming ladder&#8208;shape linkers, could enhance the stability of the frameworks and increase the density of functional sites, thus making them suitable for various applications. In this study, two double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, namely DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2, were successfully synthesized via imine condensation. The resulting DW&#8208;COFs exhibited a honeycomb topology, high crystallinity and stability. Particularly, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 showed excellent resistance toward boiling water, strong acid, and strong base, due to its double&#8208;walled structure, which limits the exposure of labile imine bonds to external chemical environments. The DW&#8208;COFs showed high porosity near 900&#8197;m2/g, making them suitable for gas storage/separation. The selective gas adsorption experiments showed that at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;atm pressure, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 exhibited a good IAST selectivity towards CO2/N2 (15/85) adsorption, with selectivity values of 121.3 and 56.4 for CO2 over N2, respectively.

         <title>Improved Triplex&#8208;Forming Isoorotamide PNA Nucleobases for A&#8722;U Recognition of RNA Duplexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isoorotamide nucleobases (Io5&#8722;Io8) are reported for incorporation into peptide nucleic acids aimed at RNA triple&#8208;helix formation. These extended nucleobases require only two hydrogen bonds across the Hoogsteen face of the A&#8722;U base pair for strong and selective binding, unlike previously reported extended nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provide further insight into triple helical binding affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
Four new isoorotamide (Io)&#8208;containing PNA nucleobases have been designed for A&#8722;U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA nonamers for binding A&#8722;U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly modified PNA compared to known A&#8208;binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, the data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A&#8208;binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.

         <title>Structural Variations in Carboxylated Bispidine Ligands: Influence of Positional Isomerism and Rigidity on the Conformation, Stability, Inertness and Relaxivity of their Mn2+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(II) complexes with acetate&#8208;substituted bispidine ligands can adopt different conformations depending on the N3 substituent. Complexes in chair&#8208;chair conformation display high relaxivity and strong kinetic inertness, both very important for their potential use as MRI contrast agents. In contrast, the boat&#8208;chair conformers undergo fast dissociation and do no retain good relaxivity.







Abstract
Mn2+ complexes of 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidine ligands have emerged as more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI probes. They display relaxivities comparable to that of commercial contrast agents and high kinetic inertness, unprecedented for Mn2+ complexes. The chemical structure, in particular the substituents on the two macrocyclic nitrogens N3 and N7, are decisive for the conformation of the Mn2+ complexes, and this will in turn determine their thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties. We describe the synthesis of four ligands with acetate substituents in positions N3, N7 or both. We evidence that the bispidine conformation is dependent on N3 substitution, with direct impact on the thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, hydration state and relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. These results unambiguously show that (i) solely a chair&#8208;chair conformation allows for favorable inertness and relaxivity, and (ii) in this family such chair&#8208;chair conformation is accessible only for ligands without N3&#8208;appended carboxylates.

         <title>Redox Activity of IrIII Complexes with Multidentate Ligands Based on Dipyrido&#8208;Annulated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Access to High Valent and High Spin State with Carbon Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetradentate carbon&#8208;based ligand allowed isolation and characterization of a formally +V tricationic iridium complex with a triplet ground state. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the figure &#8220;8&#8221; bis(dpaAr2&#8208;NHC) ligand are redox active, stabilizing the triplet state through one &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework. The similar electronegativities between Ir and C atoms allows a highly effective metal&#8208;ligand conjugation.







Abstract
Synthetic strategies to access high&#8208;valent iridium complexes usually require use of &#960; donating ligands bearing electronegative atoms (e.&#8201;g. amide or oxide) or &#963; donating electropositive atoms (e.&#8201;g. boryl or hydride). Besides the &#951;5&#8208;(methyl)cyclopentadienyl derivatives, high&#8208;valent &#951;1 carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes are challenging to synthesize. To meet this challenge, this work reports the oxidation behavior of an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;ligated anionic bis(CCC&#8208;pincer) IrIII complex. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the diaryl dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (dpa&#8208;NHC) IrIII complex allowed a stepwise 4e&#8722; oxidation sequence. The first 2e&#8722; oxidation led to an oxidative coupling of two adjacent aryl groups, resulting in formation of a cationic chiral IrIII complex bearing a CCCC&#8208;tetradentate ligand. A further 2e&#8722; oxidation allowed isolation of a high&#8208;valent tricationic complex with a triplet ground state. These results close a synthetic gap for carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes and demonstrate the electronic tuning potential of organic &#960; ligands for unusual electronic properties.

         <title>Thermally Activated Geometrical Regioselective E&#8594;Z Isomerization&#8208;Enabled Cascade Sequences of Conjugated Dienals: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal isomerization&#8208;enabled cascade: Conjugated dienals undergo regioselective 2E,4E&#8594;2Z,4E alkene isomerization in a mixture of toluene&#8208;alcohol (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) or only with alcohol at 60&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, which enables subsequent cascade sequences to furnish &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and alcohol&#8208;assisted relay proton transfer mechanism for forming a hemiacetal intermediate prior to lactonization.







Abstract
The geometrical regioselective E&#8594;Z isomerization of a conjugated alkene under thermal activation pose a challenge due to microscopic reversibility. Herein we report that such reversibility issues can be circumvented by integrating E&#8594;Z isomerization with subsequent cyclization cascade, particularly in the absence of commonly employed light, acids, or metal&#8208;catalysts. Thus, linearly conjugated dienals in a mixture of toluene&#8208;alcohol (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvents or only with alcohol at 60&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C can be converted to &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides in moderate to good yields. The intermediary 2Z,4E&#8208;isomer can be isolated, which includes the first example of isolating the regioselective isomerization product under thermal conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and ensuing cascade sequences. It has been observed that the regioselective 2E,4E&#8594;2Z,4E isomerization of dienal is a thermodynamically facile (&#916;G &lt;0) process. Structural elucidation further reveals that the presence of a certain charge transfer and a non&#8208;covalent interaction may be the primary reasons for the enhanced stability of the 2Z,4E&#8208;isomer. The thermodynamic plausibility of the subsequent cascade reaction from the Z&#8208;isomer to the anticipated product in the presence of a polar protic solvent (here MeOH) is also explicated. Out of the two probable pathways, the &#8220;hemiacetal pathway&#8221; involving a relay proton transfer is kinetically more feasible due to the diminished activation barrier than the &#8220;conjugate addition pathway&#8221;.

         <title>Multi&#8208;responsive Electropolymer Surface Coatings Based on Azo Molecular Switches and Carbazoles: Light, pH, and Electrochemical Control of Z&#8594;E Isomerization in Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative electropolymerization of bis&#8208;carbazole containing azo monomers is a facile approach for preparing light&#8208;responsive azo&#8208;based surface coatings. The formed stable films retain the photochemical properties and pH sensitivity of the azo molecular switches and demonstrate electrocatalytic control over Z&#8594;E azo bond isomerization.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive surfaces are attracting increasing interest, not least because their physicochemical properties can be selectively and temporally controlled by a non&#8208;invasive stimulus. Most existing immobilization strategies involve the chemical attachment of light&#8208;responsive moieties to the surface, although this approach often suffers from a low surface concentration of active species or a high inhomogeneity of applied coatings. Herein, electropolymerization of carbazoles as a facile and rapid approach for preparing light&#8208;responsive azo&#8208;based surface coatings is presented. The electrochemical oxidative polymerization of bis&#8208;carbazole containing azo&#8208;monomers yields stable films, in which the photochemical properties and specific pH sensitivity of azo molecular switches are retained. Moreover, the molecular design enables electrocatalytic control over Z&#8594;E azo double bond isomerization facilitated by the conductive polycarbazole backbone. Ultimately, the high degree of control over macromolecular properties yields conductive surface coatings responsive to a range of stimuli, showing great promise as a strategy for versatile application in organic electronics.

         <title>A Thiol&#8208;Michael Approach Towards Versatile Functionalized Cyclic Titanium&#8208;Oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster: We report an efficient thiol&#8208;Michael addition approach for the precise modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster (CTOC). This approach can afford high yields of fully functionalized CTOCs, which provides a powerful platform for achieving versatile functionalization of precise transition metal clusters and further applications.







Abstract
In expanding our research activities of superlattice engineering, designing new giant molecules is the necessary first step. One attempt is to use inorganic transition metal clusters as building blocks. Efficient functionalization of chemically precise transition metal clusters, however, remains a great challenge to material scientists. Herein, we report an efficient thiol&#8208;Michael addition approach for the modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster (CTOC). Several advantages, including high efficiency, mild reaction condition, capability of complete addition, high atom economy, as well as high functional group tolerance were demonstrated. This approach can afford high yields of fully functionalized CTOCs, which provides a powerful platform for achieving versatile functionalization of precise transition metal clusters and further applications.

         <title>A multi&#8208;pyridine&#8208;anchored and &#8208;linked bilayer photocathode for water reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photoelectrochemical cells. Most known dye&#8208;sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and requires the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts, suffering from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Herein, a compact bilayer photocathode is prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on NiO through the metal&#8208;pyridine coordination. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption stability in aqueous media. A stable cathodic photocurrent of 70 &#956;A/cm2 has been achieved with H2 being generated at the photocathode under the visible&#8208;light irradiation. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was estimated to be 9.1%. Transient absorption spectral studies suggest that the interfacial hole transfer occurs within a few of picoseconds. The integration of the organic photosensitizer with pyridine anchoring and linking groups is expected to provide a simple method for the fabrication of stable and efficient photocathodes</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91:9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8208;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8208;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Vinyl Carbohydrates by Tin&#8208;Free Radical Reactions of Xanthates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates have been synthesized from glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses. Key step is the radical reaction of xanthates in the presence of triethylborane, a nontoxic reagent. The mechanism has been investigated by isolation of various side products, which speak for a reversibility of the cyclopropylmethyl radical ring&#8208;opening. Compared to reactions with tributyltin hydride, higher regioselectivities in favor of the 2&#8208;vinylsubstituted sugars have been obtained. Yields are slightly lower with triethylborane, but all products have been isolated in analytically pure form. The new reaction is applicable to benzyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates, which makes free sugars accessible as well. Overall, more than 15 1,2&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;vinyl carbohydrates have been synthesized from simple precursors in only few steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 10&#8208;Membered Azecines through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [6+4] Cycloaddition and Their Transannular Reaction to Polycyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azecine fragments are frequently presented in natural products and bioactive compounds. However, minor efforts have been devoted to these 10&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycless, and their synthesis is still challenging. We report herein the first catalytic formal [6+4] cycloaddition for the synthesis of 10&#8208;membered azecines. Under palladium catalysis, the reaction of &#948;&#8208;vinylvalerolactones and benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes proceeds smoothly to afford benzofuran&#8208;fused azecines with high diastereoselectivity in moderate to good yields. A unique transannular reaction of these 10&#8208;membered azecines for the construction of polycyclic compounds is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been prepared via a general and concise synthetic pathway directly from the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling reaction precursors. For the cross&#8208;coupling key step, a new Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction, employing a Ni/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst providing the natural products in good yields and high enantiomeric purities, has been developed. Furthermore, we also report on a new approach to the northern 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene building blocks found in the naphthylisoquinoline natural products, utilizing Hartwig's borylation/methylation strategy that allows for the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
A general and concise synthetic pathway for the preparation of four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids, employing a specially developed nickel/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi coupling is reported. In the first reported direct atroposelective coupling of the fully substituted precursors, the naturally occurring cross&#8208;coupled products were generally obtained directly in reasonable yields and high enantiomeric purities. For the synthesis of the cross&#8208;coupling precursors, we employed a modification of Bringmann's known approach to the dihydroisoquinoline compounds and a newly developed route for the naphthalene building blocks. For the latter 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene precursors, our strategy utilized Hartwig's borylation/methylation approach and included the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.

         <title>Function&#8208;Led Design of Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with their customizable architectures and tunable pore functionalities present a significant potential to revolutionize membrane&#8208;based ion&#8208;separation processes. The focus of this Review is to offer a succinct, yet comprehensive discussion of how the unique features of COF membranes can be exploited in a range of ion&#8208;separation applications.







Abstract
Insufficient access to clean water and resources has emerged as one of the most pressing issues affecting people globally. Membrane&#8208;based ion separation has become a focal point of research for the generation of fresh water and the extraction of energy elements. This Review encapsulates recent advancements in the selective ion transport of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes, accomplished by strategically pairing diverse monomers to create membranes with various pore sizes and environments for specific purposes. We first discuss the merits of using COF materials as a basis for fabricating membranes for ion separation. We then explore the development of COF membranes in areas such as desalination, acid recovery, and energy element extraction, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental principles of membrane design. Lastly, we address both theoretical and practical challenges, as well as potential opportunities in the targeted design of ion&#8208;selective membranes. The goal of this Review is to stimulate future investigative efforts in this field, which is of significant scientific and strategic importance.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic PtII complex molecules were electrostatically loaded onto cationic nanosheets of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Although the PtII complexes were loaded discretely onto the nanoparticles in the dry state, when water vapor was adsorbed, the PtII complexes assembled on the nanoparticles owing to the increased mobility the adsorption of water caused in the interstitial space of the LDH aggregates.







Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;assembly of PtII complexes is key to the development of optical and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, but designing and precisely controlling them is still difficult owing to weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we report the successful water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced assembly of an anionic PtII complex [Pt(CN)2(ppy)]&#8722; (Hppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) electrostatically loaded onto cationically charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles consisting of Mg2+ and Al3+ ions. When the PtII complexes were densely loaded onto the LDH nanoparticles, the assembly was maintained, even in dilute aqueous media. In the case of sparse loading, the PtII complexes were loaded discretely in the dry state; however, when water vapor was adsorbed, the increased mobility of the PtII complexes led to their assembly on the LDH nanoparticles. The presence of water vapor led to a drastic change in luminescence from green to orange.

         <title>Catalytic Inhibition of Base&#8208;Mediated Reactivity by a Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Ligand Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic Fe4L6 tetrahedral cages with suitably sized cavities can bind the conjugate acids of basic catalysts, favoring their protonation by exogenous water in the system. This allows the catalytic inhibition of base&#8208;mediated reactions in the presence of as little as 5&#8201;% added cage, such as conjugate addition and Knoevenagel reactions.







Abstract
Spacious M4L6 tetrahedra can act as catalytic inhibitors for base&#8208;mediated reactions. Upon adding only 5&#8201;% of a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex, the conversion of the conjugate addition between ethylcyanoacetate and &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene catalyzed by proton sponge can be reduced from 83&#8201;% after 75 mins at ambient temperature to &lt;1&#8201;% under identical conditions. The mechanism of the catalytic inhibition is unusual: the octacationic Fe4L6 cage increases the acidity of exogenous water in the acetonitrile reaction solvent by favorably binding the conjugate acid of the basic catalyst. The inhibition only occurs for Fe4L6 hosts with spacious internal cavities: minimal inhibition is seen with smaller tetrahedra or Fe2L3 helicates. The surprising tendency of the cationic cage to preferentially bind protonated, cationic ammonium guests is quantified via the comprehensive modeling of spectrophotometric titration datasets.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Polarity Switching in Ethylene&#8208;bridged Urea Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible coordination of various anions to a binding site at one terminus of a urea oligomer leads to a global switch in polarity of a linear chain of hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas. The fluorescence response of a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;responsive dithiomaleimide fluorophore at the opposite terminus reveals a relayed change in local hydrogen bonding directionality.







Abstract
The reversible coordination of anions to an N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylurea located at a terminus of a linear chain of ethylene&#8208;bridged hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas triggers a cascade of conformational changes. A series of hydrogen&#8208;bond polarity reversals propagates along the oligomer, leading to a global switch of its hydrogen&#8208;bond directionality. The induced polarity switch, transmitted through four reversible urea groups, results in a change in emission and excitation wavelengths of a fluorophore located at the opposite terminus of the oligomer. The molecule thus behaves as a chemical sensor with a relayed remote spectroscopic response to variations in anion concentration. The polarity switch induced by anion concentration constitutes an artificial communication mechanism for conveying information through oligomeric structures.

         <title>Isonitrile&#8208;Proline &#8208; A Versatile Handle for the Chemoselective Derivatization of Collagen Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isonitrileproline (Inp) is introduced as the first isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acid for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The conformation directing properties of the isonitrile group and its effect on the collagen triple helix were elucidated. The value of Inp for peptide derivatization was showcased by a chemoselective ligation with a functional chlorooxime.







Abstract
Functional groups that allow for chemoselective and bioorthogonal derivatization are valuable tools for the labelling of peptides and proteins. The isonitrile is such a group but synthetic methods for its incorporation into peptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis are not known. Here, we introduce (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;isonitrileproline (Inp) as building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Conformational studies of (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;Inp and thermal stability analysis of Inp&#8208;containing collagen triple helices revealed that the isonitrile group exerts a stereoelectronic gauche effect. We showcase the value of Inp for bioorthogonal labelling by derivatization of Inp&#8208;containing collagen model peptides (CMPs). Dual labelling with a pair of bioorthogonal reactions of a CMP containing Inp and azidoproline residues further highlights the versatility of the new isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acids.

         <title>Green and Facile Preparation of Covalent Organic Frameworks Based on Reaction Medium for Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green way towards COF: In this review, we highlight the research advances in the preparation of COFs based on facile, less dangerous, and greener methods like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a new class of crystalline, well&#8208;ordered, and porous materials with intermittent constructions, are formed via organic structural parts connected through covalent bonds. These materials have been employed in several fields comprising pollutant adsorption and separation, catalysis, electrical conductivity, gas storage, etc. The preparation of COFs is mainly applied in tubes with high temperatures and degassing treatment. Furthermore, the reaction medium is involved in toxic organic solvents like toluene, dioxane, mesitylene, acetonitrile, and so on. Hence, discovering clean medium and green approaches has attracted wide attention. Recently, facile, less dangerous, and greener methods have been developed for COFs synthesis in diverse applications like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water. This review article summarizes the eco&#8208;friendly production approaches of COFs for diverse applications.

A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Influences the Bioisostery of Myo&#8208;Inositol Pyrophosphate Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;IPs) are densely phosphorylated messenger molecules involved in numerous biological processes. PP&#8208;IPs contain one or two pyrophosphate group(s) attached to a phosphorylated myo&#8208;inositol ring. 5PP&#8208;IP5 is the most abundant PP&#8208;IP in human cells. To investigate the function and regulation by PP&#8208;IPs in biological contexts, metabolically stable analogs have been developed. Here, we report the synthesis of a new fluorinated phosphoramidite reagent and its application for the synthesis of a difluoromethylene bisphosphonate analog of 5PP&#8208;IP5. Subsequently, the properties of all currently reported analogs were benchmarked using a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including co&#8208;crystallization, ITC, kinase activity assays and chromatography. Together, the results showcase how small structural alterations of the analogs can have notable effects on their properties in a biochemical setting and will guide in the choice of the most suitable analog(s) for future investigations.</dc:description>

Subsequently, the properties of all currently reported analogs were benchmarked using a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including co-crystallization, ITC, kinase activity assays and chromatography. Together, the results showcase how small structural alterations of the analogs can have notable effects on their properties in a biochemical setting and will guide in the choice of the most suitable analog(s) for future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth computational study revealing the intriguing mechanism of the recently reported isomerization of hydroxamic acids into para&#8208;aminophenols catalyzed by phenylselenyl bromide under mild conditions. Our computations not only align with the reported experimental data, effectively explaining observed phenomena such as para&#8208;selectivity but also shed light on crucial aspects of the reaction mechanism that establish limitations on the scope of the studied rearrangement. Additionally, we performed a joint theoretical/experimental study to examine the potency of the phenylsulfenyl bromide to mediate the reaction under the same conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation, Characterization and Reactivity of Key Intermediates Relevant to Reductive (Electro)catalysis with Cp*Rh Complexes containing Pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC = Mesoionic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands have been reported as excellent homogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. In combination with group 9 metals, such ligands form highly active catalysts for hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation/hydrosilylation catalysis and electrocatalysts for dihydrogen production. Despite such progress, very little is known about the structural/electrochemical/spectroscopic properties of crucial intermediates for such catalytic reactions with these ligands: solvato complexes, reduced complexes and hydridic species. We present here a comprehensive study involving the isolation, crystallographic characterization, electrochemical/spectroelectrochemical/theoretical investigations, and in&#8208;situ reactivity studies of all the aforementioned crucial intermediates involving Cp*Rh and pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands. A detailed mechanistic study of the precatalytic activation of [RhCp*] complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands is presented. Intriguingly, amphiphilicity of the [RhCp*]&#8208;hydride complexes was observed, displaying the substrate dependent transfer of H+, H&#8729; or H&#8722;. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind targeting intermediates and reactive species involving metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands and investigating the interconversion amongst them.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation of Highly Hydrophobic Triarylphosphines into Amphiphiles via Staudinger Reaction with Hydrophilic Trichlorophenyl Azide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its hydrophobic properties and reactivity, triarylphosphines (PAr3) are promising precursors for the development of new amphiphiles. However, an efficient and reliable synthetic method for amphiphiles based on highly hydrophobic PAr3 is still required. Herein, we report a straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic PAr3 into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction. By simply mixing PAr3 and a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide containing two hydrophilic chains, amphiphiles bearing a N=P bond (i.e., an azaylide moiety) were quantitatively formed. The obtained azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2 nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water with a low critical micelle concentration (up to 0.05 mM or less) due to the effective intermolecular interactions among the hydrophobic surfaces. Although the azaylide moiety is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water, the azaylide in the amphiphiles displayed notable stability in water even at 60 h, which stems from the LUMO modulation induced by the presence of three electron&#8208;withdrawing chloro groups and two twisted alkoxycarbonyl groups, according to DFT calculations. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes through efficient intermolecular interactions, resulting in the dyes exhibiting either monomer or excimer emissions in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Yndiamides with Isoxazoles via &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Fischer Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold catalysis is an important method for alkyne functionalization. Here we report the gold&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] aminative cyclization of yndiamides and isoxazoles in a direct synthesis of polysubstituted diaminopyrroles, which are important motifs in drug discovery. Key to this process is the formation, and subsequent cyclization, of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold Fischer carbene, which represents a new type of gold carbene intermediate. The reaction proceeds rapidly under mild conditions, with high regioselectivity being achieved by introducing a subtle steric bias between the nitrogen substituents on the yndiamide. DFT calculations revealed that the key to this regioselectivity was the interconversion of isomeric gold keteniminiun ions via a low&#8208;barrier &#960;&#8208;complex transition state, which establishes a Curtin&#8208;Hammett scenario for isoxazole addition. By using benzisoxazoles as substrates, the reaction outcome could be switched to a formal [5+2] cyclization, leading to 1,4&#8208;oxazepines.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Modulated FeSe/C Anode Materials for High&#8208;Stable and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity.  However, the impact of rGO on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+&#8208;ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+&#8208;ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332 mAh g&#8208;1 at 200 mA g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity.  However, the impact of rGO on the electrode-electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+-ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+-ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332 mAh g-1 at 200 mA g-1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long-term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000 mA g-1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Field Of Main Group Lewis Acids and Lewis Superacids: Important Basics and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New developments in the field of Lewis acidity are highlighted, with the focus of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group 2, 13, 14, and 15 elements. Several important basics, illustrated by modern examples (classification of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) complexes, amphoteric nature of any compound in terms of DA interactions, reorganization energies of main group Lewis acids and the role of the energies of frontier orbitals) are presented and discussed. It is emphasized that the Lewis acidity phenomena are general and play vital role in different areas of chemistry: from weak &#8220;atomophilic&#8221; interactions to the complexes of Lewis superacids.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design strategies that can access natural product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole&#8208;alkaloid inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84 compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that supress in vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Alkali&#8208;Metal Cation Affinities of Stabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of alkali&#8208;metal enolates is dominated by ion pairing. To improve our understanding of the intrinsic interactions between the alkali&#8208;metal cations and the enolate anions, we have applied Cooks&#8217; kinetic method to determine relative M+ (M = Li, Na, K) affinities of the stabilized enolates derived from acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2&#8209;cyanoacetamide, and methyl malonate monoamide in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results and moreover afford insight into the structures of the alkali&#8208;metal enolate complexes. The affinities decrease with increasing size of the alkali&#8208;metal cations, reflecting weaker electrostatic interactions and lower charge densities of the free M+ ions. For the different enolates, a comparison of their coordinating abilities is complicated by the fact that some of the free anions undergo conformational changes resulting in stabilizing intramolecular interactions. If these complicating effects are disregarded, the M+ affinities correlate with the electron density of the chelating functionalities, i.e., the carbonyl and/or the nitrile groups of the enolates. A comparison with the known association constants of the corresponding alkali&#8208;metal enolates in solution points to the importance of solvation effects for these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating between Label and Protein Conformers in Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site&#8208;directed spin labeling is a powerful tool in structural biology. However, the commonly used spin labels are conjugated to biomolecules via&#160;flexible linkers, which hampers the translation of distance distributions into biomolecular conformations. In contrast, the spin label (nitrilotriacetic acid)copper(II) [Cu2+(NTA)] bound to two histidines (dHis) is rigid and can be more easily translated into biomolecular conformations. Here, we use this label on the 71 kDa Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) to decipher whether a previously experimentally observed bimodal distance distribution is due to two conformations of the biomolecule or of the flexible spin labels. Two different PDS experiments, i.e., Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and Relaxation Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif, suggesting that the&#160;&#945;&#8208;helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu2+(NTA)&#8208;label preferentially binds to the target double Histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. This suggests that the generation of a His&#8208;null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction of strong solvatochromism in a molecular photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen generation, i.e., we show that the electronic and optical properties of the photocatalyst strongly depend on the solvent it is dissolved in. Our calculations in particular indicate a solvent dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Ground&#8208;state density functional theory and linear response time dependent density functional theory calculations are applied in order to investigate the influence of implicit solvents on the structural, electronic and optical properties of a molecular photocatalyst. Only at high dielectric constants of the solvent, the HOMO is located at the metal center of the photosensitizer, whereas at low dielectric constants the HOMO is centered at the metal atom of the catalytically active complex. We elucidate the electronic origins of this strong solvatochromic effect and sketch the consequences of these insights for the use of photocatalysts in different environments.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since Cu2+ ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu2+ detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu2+ sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu2+ detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs&#8208;based sensors for Cu2+ detection. Lastly, we present and elucidate pertinent perspectives concerning FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrene C&#8211;H Bond Insertion Approach to Carbazolones and Indolones, and a Reactivity Departure for 7&#8208;Membered Analogues.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular platform for facile access to 1,2,3,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones (H4&#8208;carbazolones) and&#160;3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones (H2&#8208;indolones)&#160;is described. The requisite 6&#8208; and 5&#8208;membered 2&#8208;arylcycloalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione precursors were readily obtained through a Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones or by a ring expansion of aryl succinoin derivatives. Enolization of one carbonyl group in the diones, conversion to a leaving group, and subsequent azidation gave 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot azidation is highly regioselective with unsymmetrically substituted 2&#8208;arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones.&#160;&#160;The regioselectivity, which is important for access to single isomers of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted carbazolones, was analyzed mechanistically and computationally. Finally, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the&#160;ortho&#160;C&#8211;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H&#173;4&#8208;carbazolones and H2&#8208;indolones. One carbazolone was elaborated to an intermediate reported in the total synthesis of&#160;N&#8208;decarbomethoxychanofruticosinate, (&#8211;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, (+)&#8208;kopsihainanine A. With 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cycloheptanedione, prepared from cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the azidation reaction was readily accomplished. However, the Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction unexpectedly led to a labile but characterizable azirine rather than the indole derivative. Computations were performed to understand the differences in reactivities of the 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones in comparison to the 7&#8208;membered analogue, and to support the structural assignment of the azirine.</dc:description>

The requisite 6- and 5-membered 2-arylcycloalkane-1,3-dione precursors were readily obtained through a Cu-catalyzed arylation of 1,3-cyclohexanediones or by a ring expansion of aryl succinoin derivatives. Enolization of one carbonyl group in the diones, conversion to a leaving group, and subsequent azidation gave 2-aryl-3-azidocycloalk-2-en-1-ones. This two-step, one-pot azidation is highly regioselective with unsymmetrically substituted 2-arylcyclohexane-1,3-diones.&#160;&#160;The regioselectivity, which is important for access to single isomers of 3,3-disubstituted carbazolones, was analyzed mechanistically and computationally. Finally, a Rh-catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the&#160;ortho&#160;C&#8211;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H&#173;4-carbazolones and H2-indolones.

         <title>Underwater Adhesives from Redox&#8208;responsive Polyplexes of Thiolated Polyamide Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the fabrication of optically clear underwater adhesives using polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs). The thiol content of the constituent PEs was varied to assess its influence on the adhesive properties of the resulting glues. These catechol&#8208;free, redox&#8208;responsive TPE&#8208;adhesives were formulated in aquo and exhibited high optical transparency and strong adhesion even on submerged or moist surfaces of diverse polar substrates such as glass, aluminium, wood, and bone pieces. The adhesives could be cured under water through oxidative disulphide crosslinking of the constituent TPEs. The polyamide backbone provided multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding interactions with the substrates while the disulphide crosslinking provided the cohesive strength to the glue. Strong adhesion of mammalian bones (load bearing capacity upto 7 kg/cm2) was achieved using the adhesive containing 30 mol% thiol residues. Higher pH and use of oxidants such as povidone&#8208;iodine solution enhanced the curing rate of the adhesives, and so did the use of Tris buffer instead of Phosphate buffer.&#160;The porous architecture of the adhesive and its progressive degradation in aqueous medium over the course of three weeks bode well for diverse biomedical applications where temporary adhesion of tissues is required.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Framework of Freestanding Vanadium Nitride Nanowires&#160;for Dendrite&#8208;Free&#160;and Long Life&#8208;span Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and&#160;low&#160;electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable&#160;dendritic growth, infinite voltage change&#160;and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a&#160;three&#8208;dimensional&#160;(3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer&#160;which&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide&#160;a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation.&#160;Meanwhile, VN NWs can&#160;decrease&#160;local current density, homogenize Li&#8208;ion &#64258;ux&#160;and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode&#160;due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode&#160;delivers&#160;a long&#8208;life span of 500 cycles (1000 hrs) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, and exhibits lower nucleation&#160;over&#8208;potential&#160;and voltage hysteresis&#160;at&#160;different current densities from 0.5~5 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in carbonate electrolyte.&#160;In conclusion, this work provides a new type&#160;of&#160;scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Reductive Species Participating Photodynamic Therapy for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the development of oxidative photodynamic therapy (O&#8208;PDT) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has made great progress for cancer treatment, tumor hypoxia, cellular adaptation and intrinsic antioxidant defenses are still obstacles at this stage. Fortunately, with the discovery and development of reactive reductive species (RRS) in the PDT process, reductive PDT (R&#8208;PDT) receives increasing research interests. The R&#8208;PDT featuring oxygen&#8208;independence is effective by reduction therapy, which promises that it still has excellent therapeutic efficacy in extremely hypoxic or even anaerobic environment. In the concept, we introduce representative strategies to boost the Type I photosensitizing pathway, and then focus on the most recent R&#8208;PDT involving hydrogen radical (H&#8226;) and single electron transfer (SET) process.</dc:description>
