         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization for Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difficulty of finding the optimal glycosylation conditions for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly leads to the use of large temperature ranges and excess reagents. This has negative atom and energy efficiency implications. We demonstrate that mirroring glycosylation temperature from solution to solid phase via an automated acceptor&#8208;adaptive optimization strategy empowers an efficient and sustainable automated glycan assembly (AGA) process.








Abstract
Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency (GE) is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclohexanol&#8208;based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations. The contextual use of both n&#8208;alkyl and glycan&#8208;mimetic acceptors for automated optimization enabled translation of optimized glycosylation temperature to highly efficient solid&#8208;phase synthesis (SPS) of disaccharides.

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed an electrochemical hydroxynitration or chloronitration bifunctionalization reaction of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond by using sodium nitrite as a nitro source, and a series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was produced in good to excellent yields.








Abstract
We herein developed a novel method for generating nitryl free radicals using sodium nitrite for the first time under electrocatalytic conditions. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features a simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes and shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.

         <title>Discrete Heterotrimetallic Assemblies Based on Rod&#8208;Shaped FeII&#8208;Metalloligands and a ZnII&#8208;Porphyrin/RuII&#8208;Metallacycle</title>

Modular self&#8208;assembly of extendable porphyrin&#8208;based heterotrimetallic discrete architectures: a new efficient strategy toward the construction of stable multicomponent functional systems.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for the preparation of heterometallic discrete porphyrin assemblies, tuned both in dimensions and number of metal centers, is described. Five rod&#8208;shaped di&#8208;pyridyl FeII&#8208;metalloligands, with varied length (1.5 &#8211; 3.2&#160;nm), lateral substituents, and number of iron centers, were used to bridge two RuII&#8208;metallacycles, made of two coplanar ZnII&#8208;porphyrin each. The resulting architectures consist of four RuII complexes, four zinc&#8208;porphyrins, and either two or four FeII&#8208;clathrochelate units. Earlier, geometrically similar sandwich&#8208;like architectures were based on purely organic connectors. Among other novel characteristics, the use of metalloligands was found to be beneficial for the overall stability, thus allowing for a solution&#8208;based characterization of the assemblies. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures were determined for the complete collection, highlighting additional key features: the two facing ZnII&#8208;porphyrin platforms are set wide apart according to the span of the two connecting metalloligands, while the latter are parallelly aligned by the anchoring ZnII&#8208;porphyrin/RuII&#8208;metallacycles, at fixed inter Fe&#183;&#183;Fe distance(s). Mutual control over these geometrical parameters is very strict, as evidenced by self&#8208;sorting experiments. Useful implementation of these systems into functional systems may be envisaged by pairing the peripheral metalloporphyrin photosensitizers with photo/redox/catalytically active inner metal cores.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue From Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocatalyst of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanospheres and TiO&#8322; has been developed from waste coffee leaves, achieving 99% MB dye degradation. The carbon reduces the bandgap, boosting UV photocatalysis, and the material shows excellent stability and recyclability, offering a sustainable, scalable solution for wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO&#8322; has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO&#8322; under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting CNPs (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO&#8322;&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO&#8322; from &#8764;3.2&#160;eV to 2.90&#160;eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion (IPD) governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over seven cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst's stability and reusability. These findings suggest that PC@CL&#8208;10 is a highly effective, low&#8208;cost photocatalyst with strong potential for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Mediated Hydroaminoalkylation of Conjugated Dienes Probed by a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth computational mechanistic probe of the zirconium&#8208;mediated hydroaminoalkylation of conjugated dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines complements previous stochiometric and catalytic studies, providing a deeper understanding of intricate mechanistic details.








Abstract
An in&#8208;depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)&#8208;ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of the main product, (E)&#8208;4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two&#8208;step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis&#8208;amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity&#8208;determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis&#8208;amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT&#8208;assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.

&lt;p&gt;An in-depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3-dienes with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)-ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of the main product, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two-step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;-hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis-amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity-determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;-hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis-amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT-assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing the Capacity Benefit of Anionic Redox in Stoichiometric Sodium Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully harnessing the capacity benefit of anionic redox reactions requires Na&#8208;stoichiometric compounds with 3d TMs. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked the first step, which delivers decent capacity with no voltage decay. We provide strategies such as designing chemical composition, multiphase structure, and ordering superstructure to further improve the energy density with anionic redox without sacrificing kinetics and energy efficiency

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries offer a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet their lower energy density remains a challenge. Anionic redox in layered oxide cathodes has the potential to enhance capacity beyond the limits of transition&#8208;metal redox. This potential is maximized in full&#8208;stoichiometric sodium compounds with 3d transition metals, a goal hindered by synthesis challenges. The successful synthesis of O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 marked a breakthrough, offering high capacity, moisture stability, and no voltage decay. Yet, issues such as irreversibility, voltage hysteresis, and slow kinetics remain. In this concept, we review the state of the art of this promising O3 phase with a brief account of other anionic&#8208;redox&#8208;based Na compounds. We then discuss strategies and prospects to address these challenges, including tuning chemical compositions, O/P multiphase structures, and superstructure ordering.

         <title>Sustainable Approaches for the Protection and Deprotection of Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>

Shield: Protection and deprotection are key to selective synthesis, but conventional methods can lack sustainability. This review highlights electrochemical and photochemical strategies as greener alternatives, emphasizing their mechanisms, functional group tolerance, and broad synthetic utility.








Abstract
While functional group tolerance is a critical consideration in synthetic method development, many functional groups often fail to remain intact under diverse reaction conditions. Therefore, the protection of specific functional groups and subsequent deprotection are convenient choices for the efficient and selective synthesis of target compounds, for which the strategies have been securely established. Meanwhile, the development of sustainable synthetic methods, particularly electrochemistry and photochemistry, has recently played a significant role in the field of organic synthesis, and these approaches have proven useful in the methods of functional group protection and deprotection. This review explores electrochemical and photochemical strategies for the protection and deprotection of functional groups, with a focus on their mechanistic diversity, sustainability, and synthetic utility across various functional group classes.

This concept article provides a critical overview on the role of organic cation in defining the physical properties of 3D hybrid perovskites, explores alternative potential cations suitable for perovskite structure formation, and aims to answer the fundamental question if it is still worth looking for new 3D perovskites.








Abstract
Within the last 15 years, 3D hybrid perovskites made a breakthrough in the development of new semiconducting materials for diverse applications. This concept article addresses several critical questions central to the development and understanding of 3D hybrid perovskites. Specifically, it explores: (1) which organic cations are currently known to stabilize 3D perovskite structures; (2) the potential for discovering and utilizing new cations to support these structures; (3) the influence of the organic cation on physical, chemical, and optoelectronic properties of 3D hybrid perovskites; and (4) whether ongoing research should focus on the synthesis of novel 3D perovskites with alternative small organic cations. By examining these questions, this article aims to provide insights into the structural versatility, property optimization, and future directions for this rapidly evolving field, while also critically evaluating the feasibility and value of expanding the library of organic cations for 3D hybrid perovskite materials.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement Mechanisms of Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage in Black Phosphorus@Ti3C2Tx (BP@Ti3C2Tx) Composite Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes</title>

A binder&#8208;free BP@Ti3C2Tx composite film electrode was prepared by vacuum filtration. Ti3C2Tx MXene forms a 3D conductive network and Ti&#9472;O&#9472;P bonds, inhibits the volume expansion of BP, achieves high capacity (685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 a /g) and excellent stability.








Abstract
A binder&#8208;free BP@Ti3C2Tx composite thin&#8208;film electrode was fabricated via a one&#8208;step vacuum filtration method, enabling precise control over morphology and scalability. The Ti3C2Tx MXene framework constructs a 3D conductive network that enhances charge transfer kinetics and mechanically confines black phosphorus (BP) particles through robust Ti&#9472;O&#9472;P bonding, effectively suppressing BP's volume expansion during cycling. Structural characterization (XRD, SEM, EDS, etc.) confirms the homogeneous &#8220;Mosaic&#8221; architecture, with BP particles uniformly embedded in the MXene matrix. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further reveals enhanced Ti&#9472;C bonding and significant Ti&#8208;O&#8208;P interfacial interactions. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance: the composite electrode achieves a discharge capacity of 685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles, near&#8208;100% Coulombic efficiency, and remarkable capacity recovery (783.21 mAh/g) after high&#8208;rate cycling (1.5 A/g). Kinetic analysis via cyclic voltammetry further indicates a reduced polarization (&#916;V&#160;=&#160;0.06&#160;V) and enhanced capacitive contribution (b&#8208;value&#160;=&#160;0.663&#8211;0.799), attributed to MXene's dual role in facilitating ion diffusion and electron transport. This work provides a scalable, binder&#8208;free electrode design strategy, offering fundamental insights into MXene&#8208;phosphorus synergism for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Synthesis, Photophysical, and Chemiexcitation Properties of Luminol&#8208;Fullerene Dyads: Toward Chemiexcitation Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emission properties of fullerene&#8208;luminol dyads, following either irradiation or chemiexcitation, are evaluated. Strong luminol (chemi)luminescence quenching is partially attributed to electron transfer.








Abstract
Fullerene&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads have been extensively studied for their unique electronic properties, with applications in photoinduced energy conversion devices. In these systems, dynamic quenching of the excited donor's emission occurs, via energy or electron transfer to the fullerene acceptor. However, there are no reports on fullerene dyads bearing chemiluminescent donor analogues. In this context, the synthesis of two luminol&#8208;fullerene D&#8208;A dyads, bridged with alkyl chains of different lengths, is reported herein. The electronic communication between the two moieties was thoroughly evaluated, following either the photo&#8208; or chemi&#8208;excitation of the linked units. Steady state and time&#8208;resolved absorption studies, combined with emission techniques, were employed to monitor the deactivation fate of excited species. In general, a significant quenching of the excited luminol&#8208;derived emission signals was observed, revealing detectable intramolecular interactions between the two moieties. Unlike what is usually observed in other luminol&#8208;based D&#8208;A systems, quenching of the excited species generated upon photo&#8208; and chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminol&#8208;fullerene dyads is attributed to electron rather than energy transfer. This was found to be consistent with the estimated Gibbs energy of photoinduced electron transfer and with DFT theoretical calculations.

         <title>A Modular Solid Phase Synthesis Approach for Glycocalix[4]Arene Derivatives and Their Multivalent Presentation on Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a calix[4]arene building block suitable for modular solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis and the preparation of functional glycocalix[4]arene. This allows us to incorporate carbohydrate ligands and further functionalities, such as alkynes at a specific position at the upper or lower rim of the calix[4]arene as demonstrated for the conjugation onto Au nanoparticles.








Abstract
Gold nanoparticles and calix[n]arenes are well&#8208;established platforms for creating multivalent carbohydrate ligands that enhance binding avidity and selectivity toward carbohydrate&#8208;recognizing receptors, such as bacterial lectins. In this study, we present a modular synthesis protocol for tailor&#8208;made and (multi)functional glycocalix[4]arene derivatives using solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis. A calix[4]arene building block with a single carboxyl group on the lower rim and four nitro groups at the upper rim is introduced. This building block is attached to a solid support using standard solid phase peptide coupling conditions, followed by reduction of the upper rim nitro functionalities to yield four amine groups, that are further functionalized through solid&#8208;phase polymer synthesis. Using this modular approach, we access a series of glyco&#8208;calix[4]arene structures that are then further conjugated onto ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. Conjugation is promoted either via one or via four alkyne groups on the glycocalixarene structure, providing a handle to tune the overall valency of the final glyco[4]calixarene&#8208;gold nanoparticle conjugates. Finally, the glycocalix[4]arene derivatives and conjugates are evaluated for their inhibitory potential against bacterial adhesion showing the importance of multivalent carbohydrate presentation to effectively block Escherichia coli (E. coli) adhesion.

         <title>Li Heteroepitaxial Deposition on Single Crystalline Ni Substrates With Enhanced Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteroepitaxial Li deposition occurs on single&#8208;crystalline Ni(110) substrates, exhibiting the same {110}&lt;001&gt;&#160;texture with the substrate and a planar morphology. Using the {110}&#8208;textured epitaxial layer as the Li anode, the Li||LiPeO4 full cell presents improved cycle life, compared with the {111}&#8208;textured Li anode and untextured Li anode.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is recognized as a highly promising anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. Nonetheless, dendrite growth and low coulombic efficiency (CE) significantly impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. The deposition morphology and chemical stability of Li are intricately linked to its crystallographic orientation. This study presents a substrate engineering approach that employs single&#8208;crystalline nickel (Ni) to facilitate epitaxial Li deposition due to their excellent lattice matching. The findings reveal that the Ni(110) substrate exhibits a more pronounced heteroepitaxial effect than Ni(111). A robust {110}&#8208;textured Li deposition was prepared on Ni(110) with a uniform planar morphology due to the lower Li self&#8208;diffusion barrier on the Li(110) plane. The {110}&#8208;textured Li epitaxial deposition improves the cycling stability in Ni&#8208;Li cells and full cells. Notably, the Li||LiFePO4 full cell utilizing the {110}&#8208;textured Li anode exhibits a high capacity retention of 109.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 350 cycles at 1 C under a low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio of 1.26. This investigation highlights the crucial role of substrate&#8208;induced heteroepitaxy in improving Li plating/stripping dynamics and provides insights for the development of stable Li metal anodes by crystallographic orientation modification.

Using the {110}-textured epitaxial layer as the Li anode, the Li||LiPeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cell presents improved cycle life, compared with the {111}-textured Li anode and untextured Li anode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal is recognized as a highly promising anode material for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. Nonetheless, dendrite growth and low coulombic efficiency (CE) significantly impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. The deposition morphology and chemical stability of Li are intricately linked to its crystallographic orientation. This study presents a substrate engineering approach that employs single-crystalline nickel (Ni) to facilitate epitaxial Li deposition due to their excellent lattice matching. The findings reveal that the Ni(110) substrate exhibits a more pronounced heteroepitaxial effect than Ni(111). A robust {110}-textured Li deposition was prepared on Ni(110) with a uniform planar morphology due to the lower Li self-diffusion barrier on the Li(110) plane. The {110}-textured Li epitaxial deposition improves the cycling stability in Ni-Li cells and full cells. Notably, the Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cell utilizing the {110}-textured Li anode exhibits a high capacity retention of 109.6 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 350 cycles at 1 C under a low negative-to-positive capacity ratio of 1.26. This investigation highlights the crucial role of substrate-induced heteroepitaxy in improving Li plating/stripping dynamics and provides insights for the development of stable Li metal anodes by crystallographic orientation modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Grafted Disulfide&#8208;Linked Linear Polymers for Heterogeneous Thiyl Radical Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting a linear disulfide&#8208;bridged polymer to a supporting polymer backbone achieved heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis. The polyvinyl backbone ensures recyclability while enabling thiyl radical generation for organic transformations. Achieving &#8764;99% conversion for diarylalkyne photooxidation, the design strategy combines robustness, solubility, and reusability, advancing thiyl radical catalysis for sustainable applications.








Abstract
Dynamic disulfide bonds offer a promising avenue for developing robust and reversible photocatalysts. This study introduces a novel polymer, Poly&#8208;SS, designed for heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, leveraging the dynamic nature of disulfide linkages. Poly&#8208;SS features linear disulfide&#8208;containing polymers grafted onto a polyvinyl backbone, combining the photoactivity of disulfide with the structural integrity of polyvinyl. This design facilitates efficient thiyl radical generation upon photoirradiation, enabling challenging organic transformations. Poly&#8208;SS demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic efficiency for the aerobic oxidation of diarylalkynes to 1,2&#8208;diketones, achieving&#160;&gt;99% conversion. The polyvinyl backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining polymer recyclability by promoting thiyl radical recombination and preserving disulfide linkages, addressing the inherent lability of molecular thiyl radicals. Furthermore, copolymerization with soluble monomer enhances the solubility of Poly&#8208;SS, enabling facile thin&#8208;film fabrication for diverse photoreactor designs. This work highlights a significant advancement in heterogeneous thiyl radical photocatalysis, showcasing the potential of carefully designed disulfide&#8208;linked polymers to overcome limitations associated with traditional molecular catalysts by integrating dynamic covalent chemistry with a robust polymer architecture.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Hydrogels with Antimicrobial or Cell Adhesive Properties for Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple strategy to generate self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based hydrogels by combining sequences that include a SaU and a bioactive motif &#8208;either cell&#8208;adhesive (RGD) or antimicrobial (LF)&#8208; with HA. The resulting systems form 3D fibrillar networks that are physicochemically characterized and exhibit selective biological functions, supporting their application in tissue engineering and the prevention of biomaterial&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Bacterial colonization on biomaterials is a major issue, leading to approximately 20% of implant failures due to infection and biofilm formation. To address this, peptide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating tailored bioactive peptides have emerged as promising candidates for applications in tissue engineering and infection control. Here, we have designed peptide sequences that incorporate i) a self&#8208;assembling unit (SaU) and ii) bioactive motifs, including the well&#8208;known arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartate (RGD) sequence to promote cell adhesion or an antimicrobial peptide derived from lactoferrin (LF) to exhibit antibacterial properties. To aid in the gelation, these peptides were combined with hyaluronic acid (HA), rendering peptide&#8208;based hydrogels without the need for additional external assembly triggers, simplifying their application in biomedical contexts. This protocol allowed for a spontaneous formation of a 3D fibrillar network, with structural and physicochemical properties suitable for tissue engineering. The biological evaluation revealed the ability of RGD&#8208;based hydrogels to increase the adhesion and spreading of osteoblastic cells compared to controls, while the LF&#8208;based hydrogels significantly reduced the viability and attachment of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains, clearly affecting bacterial morphology. This report demonstrates the feasibility of this technology to produce hydrogels incorporating distinct biological cues, highlighting their potential as versatile biomaterials to address diverse biomedical challenges.

         <title>Dextran&#8208;Assisted Biomimetic Fabrication of CdSe:Eu QDs With Enhanced Biocompatibility and Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Dextran&#8208;templated CdSe:Eu quantum dots were synthesized and coated with citrate or APTES to enhance stability and reduce cytotoxicity. Structural, optical, and biological evaluations demonstrated their potential for cellular imaging and theragnostic applications.








Abstract
A dextran templated biomimetic synthetic approach was applied for the preparation of Cadmium Selinium:Europium Quantum Dots (CdSe:Eu QDs). The present work examines synthetic variables including the effect of increasing Europium concentration during QDs&#8217; synthesis and the use of different coating agents (citrate versus APTES) to improve the QDs' colloidal stability and ameliorate their cytotoxic behavior. All samples were subjected to structural and morphological characterizations via Fourier Transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, UV&#8211;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Subsequently, biological evaluation of all the synthesized samples of bare and APTES coated CdSe:Eu QDs was conducted on epithelial HaCaT and breast cancer MCF&#8208;7. Wound healing assays were conducted to assess cytotoxicity and cell migration under QD treatment. Results showed that both coated and uncoated QDs influenced wound closure rates in a concentration&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Finally, fluorescence microscopy revealed significant green luminescence of CdSe:Eu quantum dots (QDs) in both HaCaT and MCF&#8208;7 cell lines, indicating efficient cellular uptake. The internalization of QDs was influenced by their surface properties and charge, suggesting an endocytic uptake pathway.

         <title>Coverage&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Rates of Metalation, Ring Fusion, and Polymerization of Benzoporphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, supported by scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density&#8208;functional theory, we have investigated metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins on Cu(111). We furthermore compare our results with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin on Cu(111).








Abstract
Using scanning&#8208;tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), we have investigated metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins, tetraphenyltransdisbenzoporphyrin (2&#8208;Benzo), copper&#8208;tetraphenyltransdibenzoporphyrin (Cu 2&#8208;Benzo), and tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (4&#8208;Benzo), from 280 to 1000&#160;K on Cu(111), and compare with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin (0&#8208;Benzo) on Cu(111). Using STM, we observe 2&#8208;Benzo to adsorb as individual, rather&#8208;immobile molecules at room temperature, which coalesce into elongated islands of metalated molecules at 373&#160;K. N&#160;1&#160;s XPS spectra confirm the metalation, and DFT&#8208;calculated structures and simulated STM images confirm the appearance in STM. Upon further heating to 398&#160;K, the islands become rough and irregularly shaped, before completely breaking up at 423&#160;K, most likely related to intramolecular ring fusion. Heating to 950&#160;K leads to complete polymerization and a rough structure on the surface. Using H2 TPD, we follow the coverage&#8208;dependent rates of metalation, ring fusion, and polymerization for all four molecules. The metalation rate is found to correlate with, sometimes abrupt, changes in the adsorption structures, whereas the rates of ring fusion and polymerization decrease gradually with increasing coverage, for all molecules.

         <title>The Role of Ion Size and &#960;&#8208;Interaction in Stabilizing Calix[4]arene Crown Ether Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates MAXCalix's ability to coordinate alkali and alkaline earth metal ions, showing a preference for larger ions like Cs&#8314;. Structural analysis confirms that &#960;&#8208;interactions with benzene rings enhance stability, particularly for large cations that engage both rings. Competitive NMR experiments validate that stability increases with ionic radius, demonstrating MAXCalix's strong affinity for cesium.








Abstract
This study systematically investigates the influence of ion size on the structure and stability of complexes formed between the calix[4]arene crown ether 1,3&#8208;alt&#8208;25,27&#8208;bis(3,7&#8208; dimethyloctyl&#8208;1&#8208;oxy)calix[4]arenebenzocrown&#8208;6 (MAXCalix) and mono&#8208; and divalent ions from the alkali and alkaline earth metal series. NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand's versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. In addition, &#960;&#8208;interactions between the cation and the cation&#8208;facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from &#960;&#8208;interactions with both cation&#8208;facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These &#960;&#8208;interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.

         <title>Ring Contraction of Cyclooctatetraenes toward Non&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Au(111)&#8208;Catalysis and Bulk Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au(111)&#8208;catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of tetraphenylated DA&#8208;COT and TA&#8208;COT is compared with bulk pyrolysis. On Au(111), a strain&#8208;induced contraction of the central COT unit toward six&#8208;membered rings occurs. For TA&#8208;COT, a rearrangement toward a non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings is observed as an alternative reaction product. Uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis only gives the ring contraction product for both COT derivatives.








Abstract
The Au(111)&#8208;catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of tetraphenylated diacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (DA&#8208;COT) and tetraacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (TA&#8208;COT) was investigated and compared with their uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis. On Au(111), a strain&#8208;induced contraction of the central COT unit toward six&#8208;membered rings upon extrusion of alkynes occurred. For TA&#8208;COT, an alternative reaction pathway opened up due to the increased ring strain of the eliminated alkyne product. This pathway involved a rearrangement toward a non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing a sesquifulvalene core. Intermediates and (by&#8208;)products were observed by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), verifying the predicted reaction mechanism. Formation of [8]circulene derivatives was not observed. Uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis only gave one ring contraction product, respectively, for both COT derivatives.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Ketones Using Primary Alcohols: Unveiling the Role of Manganese&#8208;Salen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electronically and sterically modulated Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) have been synthesized. Thorough investigation of the catalytic efficiency of the synthesized complexes demonstrates excellent catalytic performance for the selective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols through HA. The results highlight the emergent role of Mn&#8208;salen complexes in &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions.








Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones with primary alcohols has been systematically investigated using two distinct phosphine&#8208;free manganese&#8208;complexes (Mn&#8208;ph and Mn&#8208;en) bearing tetradentate Salen ligands. Remarkably, the complex Mn&#8208;ph with an aromatic imine bridge was found to be efficient in comparison to Mn&#8208;en, leading to an excellent yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketone with good selectivity under operationally convenient conditions. Interestingly, a wide range of aromatic, cyclic, and heterocyclic ketones are effectively alkylated under the optimized reaction conditions. Notably, the transformation proceeds via an environmentally benign and atom&#8208;efficient pathway, generating water as the sole byproduct. The control experiments reveal the involvement of dehydrogenation of alcohols and hydrogen autotransfer (HA) pathway. These findings highlight the potential of Mn(II)&#8208;salen complexes in catalytic HA processes, expanding their applications in sustainable C&#160;&#9472;&#160;C bond formation strategies.

         <title>Effect of Chalcogen Interaction on the Structure of Methine&#8208;Bridged Trichalcogenophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereochemistry of methine&#8208;bridged trichalcogenophenes was elucidated through comprehensive structural analyses. Trithiophene showed a strong preference for the ZZ configuration, whereas its trifuran analog exhibited a near&#8208;statistical distribution of geometric isomers. X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies revealed that intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding stabilizes the ZZ configuration.








Abstract
Polythienylenemethylidenes (PTMs) are promising conjugated polymers for organic electronics owing to their narrow bandgaps and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, their stereochemistry remains unexplored. In this study, methine&#8208;bridged trithiophene and trifuran analogs were synthesized to investigate stereochemistry and chalcogen bonding effects. The compounds were obtained as mixtures of ZZ, EZ(= ZE), and EE geometric isomers, established through detailed NMR analyses. At thermal equilibrium, the ZZ isomer predominated in trithiophene (ZZ:(EZ&#160;+&#160;ZE):EE&#160;=&#160;58:35:6), whereas trifuran showed a near&#8208;statistical distribution. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;S chalcogen bonding in trithiophene with S&#183;&#183;&#183;S distances (&#8776;3.04 &#197;) shorter than van der Waals radii and C&#8211;S&#183;&#183;&#183;S angles of 171&#176;. Comprehensive conformer searches and DFT calculations not only validated the higher stability of the ZZ isomer in trithiophene but also provided calculated isomer distributions that closely matched the experimental values. Multi&#8208;faceted computational analysis (electron localization function (ELF), noncovalent interaction (NCI), quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and natural bond orbital (NBO))&#160;confirmed the presence of these chalcogen&#8208;centered interactions and quantified their strength through lone pair (LP)(S)&#8594;&#963;*(S&#8211;C) donor&#8208;acceptor orbital interactions. Trithiophene exhibited a unique dual&#8208;chalcogen bonding mode in the ZZ configuration. These findings elucidate the role of chalcogen bonding in stabilizing ZZ&#8208;trithiophenes and contribute to designing PTMs with controlled stereochemistry for organic electronics applications.

         <title>Diameter Controllable Separation of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes by Simply Changing the Metal in Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discover a novel approach for diameter&#8208;selective separation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal&#8208;coordinating supramolecular polymers (M&#8208;PNB) consisting of phenanthroline&#8208;based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). Due to notable disparity in the dihedral angle of the metal&#8208;phenanthroline complex (M(phen)2), Pd&#8208; and Co&#8208;PNB preferentially extract smaller (0.90&#8211;0.92 nm) and larger (0.97&#8211;1.10 nm) diameter ranges, respectively. Moreover, the combinations of these separations (Pd&#8208;PNB/Co&#8208;PNB and Pd/Co&#8208;PNB) are found to enhance the selectivity.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic and optical properties that are highly dependent on their structures. Therefore, diameter&#8208;selective synthesis and separation are meaningful for a wide range of their applications. Although various methods have been developed for CNT separations, challenges still remain in more efficient discrimination for diameters and removal of dispersants. Here, we present a novel approach for size&#8208;tunable diameter separation of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using metal&#8208;coordinating supramolecular polymers (M&#8208;PNB) consisting of phenanthroline&#8208;based nanobrackets (PNB) and metal ions (M). The helical wrapping of SWNTs with M&#8208;PNB is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Interestingly, Pd(II) and Co(II) ions with PNB show the large difference in diameter preference to the smaller (0.90 &#8211; 0.92&#160;nm) and the larger (0.97 &#8211; 1.10&#160;nm) diameters, respectively. Moreover, the combination of these two metal ions in M&#8208;PNB is found to enhance the selectivity to the specific (n,m)&#8208;SWNTs. This method offers not only size&#8208;tunable diameter selectivity but also significant improvements in extraction efficiency and the facile and thorough removal of the host molecules as compared to previous techniques.

         <title>Amine&#8208;AlH3 Adducts as Energetic Materials for a New Generation of Solid Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New amine&#8208;AlH&#8323; adducts offer a more environmentally friendly, high&#8208;energy alternative to conventional rocket propellants, and exhibit ultra&#8208;fast ignition. They can be synthesized by mechanochemical method under hydrogen pressure starting from aluminum metal directly or by wet chemical processes with AlH3.








Abstract
Energetic materials, mainly propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics, are crucial in various civilian applications, such as fuels for rockets and spacecraft. Current energetic fuels rely on highly toxic and polluting ammonium perchlorate (AP) or carcinogenic hydrazine derivatives, encouraging the search for greener and safer substitutes. This work demonstrates the first use of amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts as potential solid fuels with promising hypergolic properties, high energy content, and without toxic derivatives. The herein presented four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts, AlH3 coordinated with quinuclidine (Quin), triethylenediamine (TEDA), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), and tetraazatricyclododecane (TATD), illustrate a unique strategy to create new solid fuels by combining AlH3 with an energy&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule. The crystal structures of new compounds ([HMTA&#8208;AlH3]n and [TATD&#8208;AlH3]n) are determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Differential scanning calorimetry&#8208;thermogravimetric analysis (DSC&#8208;TGA) of the samples combined with mass spectrometry (MS) evidence high thermal stability. The ultrashort ignition delays as low as one&#160;ms show an excellent hypergolic response. Four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts have higher combustion heat (&gt;&#160;29&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8722;1) than conventional hydrazine fuels (19.5&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8722;1). Finally, the successful mechanochemical syntheses of Quin2AlH3 and [HMTA&#8208;AlH3]n are introduced, showcasing a green chemistry approach to energetic materials.

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen for Targeted Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ApApt is a light&#8208;up probe designed for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer cells. It combines AIEgen with the aptamer SYL3C to specifically target EpCAM&#8208;positive cancer cells. Upon aptamer&#8208;EpCAM binding, ApApt emits strong fluorescence due to the restricted intramolecular motion of AIEgens. This activation enables efficient ROS generation for targeted PDT under light irradiation, offering a precise approach for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising noninvasive treatment for cancer and other diseases. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers are excellent candidates for enhancing the efficacy of image&#8208;guided PDT due to their unique properties. DNA&#8208;modified AIE luminogens (AIEgens) offer an effective approach for nucleic acid detection and biospecies sensing, but their applications in tumor cell imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT have been rarely reported. Herein, we designed a light&#8208;up probe, named ApApt, for targeted imaging and image&#8208;guided PDT of cancer cells. The probe was prepared by conjugating AIEgen with aptamer and displayed specific targeting ability to EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)&#8208;positive cancer cells. ApApt exhibits good water solubility and shows very low emission in aqueous solution. However, it emits strong fluorescence as a result of the restricted intramolecular motion (RIM) activation of AIEgens, which is triggered by the specific binding between the aptamer SYL3C and EpCAM protein. Upon delivery to cancer cells, ApApt efficiently generates ROS for targeted PDT under light irradiation.

         <title>Reactivity of &#948;&#8208;Functionalized Para&#8208;Quinone Methides in Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivities of &#948;&#8208;functionalized para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) were characterized by kinetic studies of their reactions with carbanions in DMSO. Evaluating the second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation gave the electrophilicities E of pQMs. Reactivities of unseen &#948;&#8208;functionalized pQMs can be predicted by using the linear relationship of E with a combination of quantum chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAA) and buried volumes (%Vbur).








Abstract
The electrophilic reactivities of para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) with functional groups (FG) at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8211;carbon double bond were determined by photometrically monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 &#176;C. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg k2&#160;=&#160;sN(N&#160;+&#160;E), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors E of the pQMs. These electrophilicity parameters E were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the pQM reactions with C&#8208;, H&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters E correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%Vbur). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation, %Vbur values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &#948;&#8208;position of the pQMs. Knowledge of MAA and %Vbur thus enables chemists to tailor novel pQMs with predictable reactivity properties.

&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;N&#160;&lt;/i&gt;+&#160;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; of the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;QMs. These electrophilicity parameters &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;QM reactions with C-, H-, N-, O-, and S-centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum-chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bur&lt;/sub&gt;). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation, %&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bur&lt;/sub&gt; values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-position of the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;QMs. Knowledge of MAA and %&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bur&lt;/sub&gt; thus enables chemists to tailor novel &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;QMs with predictable reactivity properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Removal of Phaeocystis Globosa From Seawater via Polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;Modified Pyrite Activated Persulfate</title>

Abstract
Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa) is a highly motile and toxic harmful algal bloom (HAB) species in marine environments. The outbreak of P. globosa poses severe threats to aquaculture and coastal nuclear power safety and causes economic losses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel algal removal technologies to control P. globosa blooms. Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;modified pyrite (PVP&#8208;FeS2) was synthesized as a catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for removing P. globosa in seawater. The introduction of PVP effectively modulated the morphology, particle size, and catalytic performance of FeS2. The results demonstrated that a system containing 0.3&#160;g/L PVP&#8208;FeS&#8322; and 0.8&#160;mM PS achieved 95.9% removal efficiency of P. globosa within 4&#160;hours. The Fe and S species on the PVP&#8208;FeS2 surface played critical roles in activating PS to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) for algal cell oxidation and produce iron hydroxides to promote the flocculation of algal cells. In addition, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system maintained the integrity of algal cells and avoided the release of large amounts of intracellular organic matter. More importantly, the PVP&#8208;FeS2/PS system can simultaneously remove multiple HABs from seawater, and is expected to be applied in the field of emergency mitigation of red tide events.

         <title>Investigating the Site&#8208;Specific Impact of Fluorine Substitution on Aromatic Interactions in a Tryptophan Zipper Peptide</title>

Constitutional isomers of fluoro&#8208;tryptophan alter the stability of the &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide Trpzip2 by tuning key CH/&#960; and NH/&#960; interactions.








Abstract
The stability of pairwise tryptophan (Trp) edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions has been exploited in the design of small tryptophan zipper (Trpzip) peptides. Herein, we report a systematic study of the regiospecific impact of four constitutional isomers of non&#8208;natural fluoro&#8208;Trp, regarding their incorporation at either edge&#8208; or face&#8208;positions. Single fluorine substituents affect the electron density of the indole moiety and introduce a highly electronegative component while the native geometry of Trp is maintained. We employed a library approach based on the sequence of Trpzip2 and assessed peptide structure and stability using CD, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy. Global hairpin stability was improved or compromised upon site&#8208;specific incorporation of a single monofluoro&#8208;Trp regioisomer. Fluorine substitution revealed key CH/&#960; interactions within the Trp/Trp packing and holds potential for the future optimization of aromatic interactions involving Trp.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis and Isolation of Unimolecular Oligo[n]catenanes Using a One&#8208;Pot CuAAC &#8220;Click&#8221; Reaction Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic approach using copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) ring&#8208;closing strategies in relatively dilute conditions was used to make &#8220;click&#8221; [n]catenanes with open metal&#8208;binding sites at the ends for further growth. First, a [2]catenane was made at 82% yield using a slow&#8208;addition method. Then, a rapid&#8208;addition one&#8208;pot method was used to make a well&#8208;defined dispersity of [2]&#8211;[6]catenanes with an overall yield of 18%.








Abstract
Within the field of mechanically interlocked molecules, catenanes have garnered much interest in the past few decades due to their chain&#8208;like architecture of interlocked molecular rings. This interest stems from their unique properties and degrees of freedom that are distinct in comparison to traditional molecular architectures, a fact that makes catenanes potentially attractive building blocks in the construction of next&#8208;generation polymeric materials. Most approaches to make unimolecular [n]catenanes are either low yielding or are laborious, often relying on multistep pathways for preparation and purification. Therefore, developing efficient syntheses for [n]catenanes remains an important challenge for chemists. Here, we describe a template&#8208;directed one&#8208;pot approach that overcomes the limitations of multistep syntheses by using simple, symmetrical phenanthroline&#8208;based building blocks and CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry to yield a series of unimolecular [n]catenanes. This methodology relies on simultaneous copper(I)&#8208;based templation and click chemistry, ultimately resulting in a one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy to make either a [2]catenane in high yield (82%) or a batch of well&#8208;defined linear [2]&#8211;[5]catenanes (and trace amounts of a [6]catenane) in an 18% overall yield, depending on the rate of addition of the alkyne&#8208; and azide&#8208;functionalized precursors (i.e., slowly or all at once). Such kinetic control represents a potential pathway toward the preparation of higher&#8208;order [n]catenanes capable of further chain extension using very simple precursors.

         <title>Synthesis of Siphonazole B Through Domino Cycloisomerization&#8208;Oxazolonium Ion Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study by Strand and co&#8208;workers describes a concise synthesis of siphonazole B. Both oxazole units are formed from a simple propargylamine using a novel domino cycloisomerization&#8208;rearrangement approach. Additional synthetic features include a direct aldol&#8208;type reaction for assembling the tricyclic siphonazole core and an oxidative amidation reaction to install the sensitive (E)&#8208;penta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dieneylamide.








Abstract
4&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;acyloxazoles represent important substructures across a diverse array of bioactive molecules. Practical methods to synthesize these motifs are, therefore, of considerable interest. Here, we develop a novel domino process wherein a cycloisomerization is followed by a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement via an oxazolonium ion to yield 4&#8208;alkenyloxazoles from an abundant &#946;&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl propargylamine and acyl chlorides. The synthetic utility of the method is highlighted by its application to both oxazole units of siphonazole B, leading to a concise convergent total synthesis of this natural product.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed photoredox strategy has been developed to provide an alternative and efficient approach for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diarylallenes from propargyl alcohols under N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;and hydride&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
Allenes are a class of important organic compounds, and their synthesis has always been of great interest. In this article, we have developed a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed photoredox strategy, providing an alternative and efficient approach for the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diarylallenes from propargyl alcohols. The reaction utilized organic amines as a hydrogen source to avoid the use of conventional hydride additives and does not require the addition of extra N,N&#8208;ligands to activate the cobalt catalyst, achieving a mild reaction condition. As a result, the reaction was able to synthesize the desired 1,3&#8208;diarylallene compounds with good yields and functional group compatibility.

A water/trimethylolpropane (TMP) hybrid electrolyte with expanded ESW and lowered freezing point is designed for ASIBs. An ESW of 2.85&#160;V and a freezing point below &#8208;80 &#176;C are realized, benefiting from the reconstruction of hydrogen bonds due to the introduction of TMP molecules. Equipped with this hybrid electrolyte, the full cells display a specific capacity of 56.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 88% capacity retention after 800 cycles. Even at low temperatures of &#8208;20 &#176;C, a specific capacity of 50.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles is also achieved.








Abstract
Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) have attracted significant attention due to the advantages of high safety and low cost for energy storage devices. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes and freezing at low temperatures limit practical applications. Herein, we broaden the ESW to 2.85&#160;V and reduce the freezing point (below &#8208;80 &#176;C) by using trimethylolpropane (TMP) additive to 1&#160;M NaNO3 aqueous solution. Based on this hybrid electrolyte and equipped with a bimetallic Prussian blue analogue (NaCuHCF) cathode and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode, the full cells display a specific capacity of 56.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 88% capacity retention after 800 cycles. Even at low temperatures of &#8208;20 &#176;C, a specific capacity of 50.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles is also achieved. A series of spectral tests illustrate the interaction between TMP and water molecules, which realizes the excellent electrochemical performances, especially at low temperatures. This work provides a new strategy for the application of ASIBs in extreme weather and expands the practical application of aqueous batteries.

DFT calculations for the Hg(I) 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene complex, [(MesDPM)Hg]2, predict a 199Hg chemical shift of &#8722;648&#160;ppm. The experimental 199Hg NMR spectrum features a singlet close to the predicted shift, at &#8722;772&#160;ppm, demonstrating the utility of DFT for the characterization of Hg coordination complexes.








Abstract
In this work, we describe the easy synthesis of mercury complexes with the 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene (MesDPM) ligand. The compounds were characterized using standard analytic methods such as NMR, IR, as well as UV/Vis spectroscopy. The molecular structures in solid state were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments. In addition, the 199Hg NMR chemical shifts were determined by measurements and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Controlling Topology of a Telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex DNA With a Chemical Cross&#8208;link</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically stable G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA: Chemical cross&#8208;linking between distant nucleotides led to formation of G4&#8208;DNA that is stable in the presence of complementary DNA. This methodology can be used to reliably form G4s within DNA fibers for subsequent structural studies of G4&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical structures formed in guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, they are nonrandomly distributed and influence DNA replication, gene expression, and genome maintenance. Numerous proteins involved in these processes have been identified as G4&#8208;binding proteins. However, the interaction of proteins with G4s in the context of double&#8208;stranded DNA in vitro has been difficult to study due to the transient nature of G4s in the presence of complementary DNA. To overcome this challenge, introducing internal covalent cross&#8208;links between distant nucleotides within the DNA sequence may promote pre&#8208;folding of G4 structures, thereby shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium toward G4&#8208;formation. We used a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to create a cross&#8208;link between 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;propargylguanosine and N6&#8208;azidoethyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine in the DNA telomeric sequence (TAG3T)2. A cross&#8208;link between G3 and A8 reinforced the parallel G4 topology that was stable in the presence of complementary DNA. Moreover, even in the presence of its complementary strand, this cross&#8208;linked G4 recruited the parent native DNA (TAG3T)2 to form a hybrid G4. These results suggest that cross&#8208;linking provides a useful tool for stabilizing noncanonical DNA structures in the presence of complementary strands, enabling their study within the context of genomic DNA.

         <title>Strong Magnetic Coupling and Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Behavior in Tetrazinyl Radical&#8208;Bridged Metallocenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine with Ln metallocenes led to the isolation of two new radical&#8208;bridged dinuclear complexes. Strong magnetic Ln&#8211;rad coupling was observed, which afforded zero&#8208;field SMM behavior for the Dy analogue.








Abstract
Exchange coupling is essential in defining the magnetic behavior of polymetallic lanthanide&#8208;based (LnIII) single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), where, thanks to the unpaired electron(s), radical ligands show promise as magnetic bridges between the paramagnetic metal centers. Combining high&#8208;performance lanthanide metallocene [Cp*&#8322;Ln]+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) units with the 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine radical ligand (bmtz&#8226;&#8722;) yielded two new radical&#8208;bridged dinuclear lanthanide metallocenes, [(Cp*&#8322;Ln)&#8322;(bmtz&#8226;&#8722;)](BPh4)&#183;Solvent (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd (1), Solvent&#160;=&#160;THF; Dy (2), Solvent&#160;=&#160;toluene). The strong magnetic exchange coupling of JGd&#8211;rad = &#8208;12.6 cm&#8722;1 observed in 1, was probed via SQUID magnetometry as well as computational studies.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of 3,6-bis(2-pyrimidyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine with Ln metallocenes led to the isolation of two new radical-bridged dinuclear complexes. Strong magnetic Ln&#8211;rad coupling was observed, which afforded zero-field SMM behavior for the Dy analogue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange coupling is essential in defining the magnetic behavior of polymetallic lanthanide-based (Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;) single-molecule magnets (SMMs), where, thanks to the unpaired electron(s), radical ligands show promise as magnetic bridges between the paramagnetic metal centers. Combining high-performance lanthanide metallocene [Cp*&#8322;Ln]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) units with the 3,6-bis(2-pyrimidyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine radical ligand (bmtz&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) yielded two new radical-bridged dinuclear lanthanide metallocenes, [(Cp*&#8322;Ln)&#8322;(bmtz&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)](BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&#183;Solvent (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Solvent&#160;=&#160;THF; Dy (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), Solvent&#160;=&#160;toluene). The strong magnetic exchange coupling of &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Gd&#8211;rad&lt;/sub&gt; = -12.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; observed in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, was probed via SQUID magnetometry as well as computational studies. This, combined with the highly anisotropic Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, leads to zero-field SMM behavior and slow magnetic relaxation through thermally activated processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1) reacts with potassium alkoxides to give potassium hydrido&#8208;alkoxo&#8208;germanato&#8208;borates {K(THF)2[BH3&#183;Ge(L)(H)(OR)]}2 (R&#160;=&#160;tBu (2), C(CH3)2CH2CH3 (3)) as products of KOR addition. Moreover, complex 1 was tested as useful catalyst for esterification of aldehydes by KOtBu to yield t&#8208;butyl esters of appropriated carboxylic acids.








Abstract
The reactions of the monomeric C,N&#8208;chelated organogermanium(II) hydride L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1) with potassium alkoxides KOR provided potassium hydrido&#8208;alkoxo&#8208;germanato&#8208;borates {K(THF)2[BH3&#183;Ge(L)(H)(OR)]}2 (R&#160;=&#160;tBu (2), C(CH3)2CH2CH3 (3)) as products of KOR addition. Compounds 2 and 3 react with benzaldehyde under formation of alkyl esters of benzoic acid along with elimination of a neutral complex L(H)Ge&#183;BH3 (1). Thus complex 1 was tested as a useful catalyst for esterification of aldehydes by KOtBu. The GC&#8208;MS analysis revealed formation of t&#8208;butyl esters of appropriated carboxylic acids. The mechanistic studies for the esterification of benzaldehyde with KOtBu catalyzed by 1 were also performed either theoretically (DFT calculations), or experimentally (NMR and IR spectroscopy).

         <title>Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Deoxygenation of Alcohols by Using Hydrosilanes as Reductants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for selective C&#9472;O bond cleavage using Sc(OTf)&#8323; as the catalyst in the presence of hydrosilanes as reductants is reported. Alcohols, ketones, and alkyl halides were efficiently reduced to the corresponding alkanes, with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.








Abstract
Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient scandium&#8208;based catalytic system that enables highly selective reduction of &#963; bonds (C&#9472;O) in the presence of more reactive &#960; (C&#9552;O) or O&#9472;H bonds. Employing 5&#160;mol% of Sc(OTf)3 as the catalyst, a diverse range of aryl and alkyl hydrosilanes proved to be highly effective in reducing secondary and tertiary alcohols to the corresponding alkanes. Furthermore, this protocol was extended to the deoxygenation of ketones and the hydrodehalogenation of alkyl halides.

         <title>What Can be Learned From the Electrostatic Environments Within Nitrogenase Enzymes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic M&#8208;clusters of nitrogenase enzymes exhibit characteristic electrostatic patterns around the sites involved in N2 fixation. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site is consistently identified, as well as a minor field pointing toward the Fe6 sites. Furthermore, a significant long&#8208;range field along the Fe2&#8211;Fe6 axis is computed. These patterns may significantly impact the chemical reactivity of these clusters.








Abstract
Nitrogen fixation is a fundamental, and yet challenging, chemical transformation due to the intrinsic inertness of dinitrogen. Whereas industrial ammonia synthesis relies on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process, nitrogenase enzymes achieve this transformation under ambient conditions&#8212;yet at the expense of a remarkably high ATP demand. Understanding their mode of operation could inspire the development of more efficient synthetic catalysts. In this study, we scrutinize the electrostatic environment surrounding nitrogenase's active site, the so&#8208;called M&#8208;cluster. Strikingly, we observe that all types of M&#8208;clusters exhibit similar trends, with distinct patterns around the individual metal sites that have been proposed as potential N2&#8208;coordination sites. Specifically, a strong local electric field pointing away from the Fe2 site is identified, as well as a minor field pointing toward the Fe6 sites. Furthermore, a significant oriented long&#8208;range field along the Fe2&#8211;Fe6 axis is computed across the entire family of nitrogenases. In the final part of the manuscript, we discuss how the observed electrostatic patterns may impact chemical reactivity, and how they can be connected to previously made mechanistic hypotheses. Overall, this study provides further evidence for the ubiquitousness of local electric fields in enzyme catalysis, even when substrates that seemingly have only limited electrostatic susceptibility are involved.

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potential&#8208;Enabled Discovery of Chlorofullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 40, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work introduces a DFT&#8208;accurate machine learning potential for the C&#8211;Cl system, enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP accurately reproduces various experimentally known chlorofullerenes and uncovers structural and stability correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives, offering theoretical insights into chlorofullerene formation.








Abstract
Chlorination is an effective method for stabilizing fullerenes with pentagon adjacencies, transforming reactive sp2 carbon sites into sp3 hybridization to release local strain and reorganize orbital and spin distributions. Yet, the immense variety of fullerene isomers and their diverse chlorination sites pose significant challenges for accurate structural prediction. This study introduces a density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;accurate machine learning potential (MLP) for the C&#8208;Cl system, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP precisely replicates a range of experimentally identified chlorofullerenes and establishes correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives in terms of structural features and stability, offering theoretical insights into the formation principles of chlorofullerenes.

&lt;p&gt;The present work introduces a DFT-accurate machine learning potential for the C&#8211;Cl system, enabling high-throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP accurately reproduces various experimentally known chlorofullerenes and uncovers structural and stability correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives, offering theoretical insights into chlorofullerene formation.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chlorination is an effective method for stabilizing fullerenes with pentagon adjacencies, transforming reactive sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon sites into sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization to release local strain and reorganize orbital and spin distributions. Yet, the immense variety of fullerene isomers and their diverse chlorination sites pose significant challenges for accurate structural prediction. This study introduces a density functional theory (DFT)-accurate machine learning potential (MLP) for the C-Cl system, facilitating high-throughput screening of chlorinated fullerenes. The MLP precisely replicates a range of experimentally identified chlorofullerenes and establishes correlations between parent fullerenes and their chlorinated derivatives in terms of structural features and stability, offering theoretical insights into the formation principles of chlorofullerenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Sequence Structure of Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Containing Segment on Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>

The influence of sequence structure of donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;conjugated segment on CDSA behavior and photophysical/chemical properties is examined by using block copolymers containing block&#8208;like BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT and alternative&#8208;like B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT segments, respectively, as model samples. The results reveal that B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT segments exhibit more pronounced intra/ intermolecular charge transfer than BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT, which leads to much stronger intermolecular interactions for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b units, higher resistance toward the dissolution for the seed micelles with a B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT core and appealing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;based fiber&#8208;like micelles.








Abstract
Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has emerged as a facile strategy to generate donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanofibers with potential applications from photocatalysis to nanomedicine. However, the reports on CDSA of D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;based block copolymers (BCPs) are rather rare. In this context, we report two types of BCPs containing the same corona&#8208;forming poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) segment, but different core&#8208;forming D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated blocks, one of which (BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT) contains an OPE5 segment flanked by two electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) unit and another one of which (B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT) contains four phenylene (B) units and three BT units placed in an alternate way. The BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles were not kinetically frozen with obvious micellar dissolution at room temperature, whereas almost no micellar dissolution occurred for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles. However, only polydisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles can be formed by self&#8208;seeding approach owing to presence of multiple packing modes for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 over the micellar elongation. The B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT exhibited much more pronounced intra/intermolecular charge transfer effect than BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT, and thus the micelles of B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 exhibited about 50&#160;nm red&#8208;shift in UV/vis absorption band than that of BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 and appealing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities. This work highlights the importance of sequence structure of D/A units of D&#8208;A segments on both CDSA behavior and photophysical/ chemical properties.

         <title>Productive Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Fatty Esters with Carboxylate SNS Ruthenium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylate ruthenium complexes, prepared from easily accessible ruthenium precursors and bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethyl)amine (SNS ligand), efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation (HY) of methyl decanoate (model for the FAME reduction) to 1&#8208;decanol with H2 under mild conditions and without solvents. The acetate trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh3)] derivative catalyzes the HY of a number of long&#8208;chain and aromatic methyl&#8208; and ethyl esters at extremely high S/C (up to 100,&#160;000).








Abstract
The carboxylate pincer complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OCOR)2(SNS)(PPh3)] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3 1, tBu 2; SNS&#160;=&#160;bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethylamine) are obtained from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OCOR)2(PPh3)2] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3, tBu) and HN(CH2CH2SEt)2 in acetone by elimination of PPh3. Substitution of PPh3 in 1 with PPh2Me gives trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh2Me)] (3) in toluene at 105&#176;C. The cationic complexes cis&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(dppb)]OAc (4) and [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)(SNS)(PPh3)]OAc (5) are synthesized from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(dppb)] and [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(CO)(PPh3)2], respectively, by treatment with the SNS ligand in toluene. Hydride trans&#8208;[RuH(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(PPh3)] (6) is obtained by reaction of 1 with NaOiPr in a mixture of iPrOH/toluene. The carboxylate complexes 1&#8211;6 catalyze the homogeneous hydrogenation of methyl decanoate to 1&#8208;decanol with NaOMe under mild reaction conditions (T&#160;=&#160;40&#176;C, H2 pressure 27.5&#160;bar) and extremely low catalyst loading (S/C 10,000&#8211;100,000). Complexes 1 and 2 display remarkably high catalytic activity for the reduction of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters at S/C of 50,000&#8211;100,000, with high selectivity for the reduction of the carboxylate group in the presence of C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C functionalities. An easy scale&#8208;up of this process (100&#160;mmol of substrate) has been demonstrated. Mechanistic studies show that 1 reacts with H2 (5&#160;bar), affording the monohydride 6, that by further reaction with H2 and an alkoxide gives the dihydride cis&#8208;[RuH2(SNS)(PPh3)], which reduces methyl benzoate to benzyl alcohol.

         <title>Hybrid Tuning in NHC Ligands: Synergistic Effects of BIAN &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Aryl &#963;&#8208;Modulation in Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study investigates how combining &#960;&#8208;extended backbones with aryl substituent variation in Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes affects their structure, photophysics, reactivity, and toxicity. It is evident that subtle changes in substituent type and position give rise to distinct trends, thus demonstrating how it is possible to harness &#960;&#8211;&#963; interactions in order to fine&#8208;tune properties for catalytic and biomedical applications.








Abstract
In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &#960;&#8211;&#963; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X&#8208;ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine&#8208;grained design of NHC&#8208;based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;The present study investigates how combining &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended backbones with aryl substituent variation in Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; complexes affects their structure, photophysics, reactivity, and toxicity. It is evident that subtle changes in substituent type and position give rise to distinct trends, thus demonstrating how it is possible to harness &lt;i&gt;&#960;&#8211;&#963;&lt;/i&gt; interactions in order to fine-tune properties for catalytic and biomedical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; complexes were synthesized by introducing electron-withdrawing substituents (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-, and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-positions of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X-ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV-Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine-grained design of NHC-based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Crystal Actuation of Fluorinated Acylhydrazones Enabled by [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;IND, DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD) were successfully synthesized and demonstrated dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365 nm UV irradiation. The photochemical mechanism was explored in detail and highlighted the essential role of the C&#9552;N bond in the acylhydrazone framework for enabling [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;driven actuation. Our structural engineering strategy established a design paradigm for photoresponsive materials through rational selection of hydrazide precursors, enabling precise modulation of optomechanical properties.








Abstract
Crystalline materials with photomechanical responsiveness have garnered significant attention in flexible actuators and micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems due to their unique capability to directly convert light into mechanical energy. In this work, four novel fluorinated acylhydrazone compounds were successfully synthesized through direct condensation reactions between 4,4&#8242;&#8208;difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and acylhydrazine compounds, including benzoylhydrazine (BHD), 3&#8208;fluorobenzoylhydrazine (3&#8208;FBHD), isoniazid (IND), and acetylhydrazine (AED). Systematic investigation of their photomechanical responses revealed distinct molecular mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that isomeric fluorinated acylhydrazone derivatives (DFBP&#8208;BHD, DFBP&#8208;3&#8208;FBHD, DFBP&#8208;IND) exhibit dynamic photo&#8208;responsive behavior ranging from crack initiation to crystal fragmentation under 365&#160;nm UV irradiation, whereas the hydrazone derivative DFBP&#8208;AED remains inert. This confirms the essential role of [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloaddition&#8208;dependent C&#160;=&#160;N double bonds in photomechanical activity. Comprehensive characterization through DSC, TG, XRD, &#185;H/&#185;3C NMR, and MS elucidated the formation pathways and structural characteristics of photocycloaddition products. Density functional theory calculations revealed that energy disparities between (0 0 1) and (1 0 0) crystallographic planes govern longitudinal fragmentation patterns. This study establishes a &#8220;molecular structure&#8208;crystal arrangement&#8208;macroscopic response&#8221; multi&#8208;scale regulation strategy, offering novel insights for developing high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven materials.

         <title>Preparation of Hierarchically Porous Monolithic Corn Straw@COF Composite for Fat&#8208;Rich Food Pretreatment in Non&#8208;Targeted Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous monolithic composite CS@COF was synthesized by the in situ growth of covalent organic framework (COF) on the CS surface. It achieved 98% removal of triglycerides and high recovery of 190 chemical hazards from fat&#8208;rich food, providing an efficient and cost&#8208;effective solution for sample pretreatment in food non&#8208;targeted analysis.









Abstract
In the food safety non&#8208;targeted analysis, it is urgent to develop suitable adsorbent materials for sample pretreatment, so as to achieve efficient removal of interference matrices in food samples and &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of potential chemical hazards. Traditional adsorption materials exhibit limitations such as poor removal efficiency and high cost. To address these issues, this study presents the preparation of a hierarchically porous monolithic corn straw@COF (CS@COF) composite for efficient sample pretreatment of fat&#8208;rich foods. CS@COF combines the advantages of corn straw (CS) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), offering a high specific surface area and porosity. CS serves as a carrier for in&#8208;situ growth of COF, resulting in a material with easy operation and low cost. CS@COF demonstrates strong adsorption capacity, effectively removing over 98% of triglycerides within 8 minutes from fat&#8208;rich food samples like soybean. Moreover, it achieves &#8220;full recovery&#8221; of 190 chemical hazards with 89% recoveries within the ideal range. The reusability of CS@COF for 5 cycles after elution further underscores its practicality. This innovative CS@COF composite shows great potential in sample pretreatment for non&#8208;targeted food safety analysis, providing a cost&#8208;effective and efficient solution.

         <title>The Nature and Stability of Transition Metal&#8208;Anchored Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our quantum chemical analyses of the bonding trends between period 4 transition metals and nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support reveal that the metal&#8211;support interaction strengthens from Ti to Ni, then weakens from Ni to Zn. This trend arises from changes in bonding interaction between the transition metals&#8217; 3dxy orbital and nitrogen lone pairs of the graphene support.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;anchored nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent an emerging class of catalysts that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To prevent demetallation and ensure catalyst stability, sufficiently strong bonds between the transition metal and the support are essential. We have quantum chemically analyzed the trend in bonding interaction between period 4 transition metals (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and the four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene support. We find that the metal&#8211;support interactions strengthen from Ti to Ni but weaken from Ni to Zn. Activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital (KS&#8208;MO) analyses reveal that this trend stems from changes in the interaction between the metal's 3dxy atomic orbital and the nitrogen lone pair orbitals of the support. As we move along period 4, the bonding mechanism changes from an increasingly more stabilizing HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti&#8208;Ni), due to the higher effective nuclear charge of the metal, to a less favorable HOMO&#8211;SOMO (TM&#160;=&#160;Cu) and unfavorable HOMO&#8211;HOMO (TM&#160;=&#160;Zn) interaction, as a result of the filling of the metal's 3dxy atomic orbital. This results in the observed strengthening, followed by weakening, of the metal&#8211;support interaction. These insights could guide the rational design of future single&#8208;atom catalysts.

&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; atomic orbital. This results in the observed strengthening, followed by weakening, of the metal&#8211;support interaction. These insights could guide the rational design of future single-atom catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers With Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D CPs are promising materials for the adsorption of VOCs. Solid&#8208;state NMR was applied to characterize host&#8208;guest interactions and dynamics of chlorobenzene in two CPs with different topologies. While ligand dynamics were similar in both CPs, chlorobenzene was found to undergo more restricted dynamics in the CP with polycatenated topology because of the smaller free volume and stronger interactions.








Abstract
1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as a metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on&#8208;resonance 1H free induction decays (FIDs), 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated with the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.

         <title>Cathepsin L&#8208;Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Resistant Breast Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an urgent need for non&#8208;invasive tools capable of real&#8208;time, in situ tracking of drug&#8208;resistant cell populations. Cathepsin L (CTSL), a cysteine protease overexpressed in aggressive malignancies, presents such an opportunity. This work designs a CTSL&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe by synergizes a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (FR) with a fluorophore (DCO), tailored for imaging drug&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells. FR&#8208;DCO can achieve fluorescence enhancement upon CTSL activation, distinguishes MCF&#8208;7/ADR from non&#8208;resistant cells and visualizes resistant tumors in vivo with 2&#8208;fold higher signal intensity than controls.








Abstract
Precise identification of drug&#8208;resistant tumor cells remains a critical challenge for optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. Herein, we present FR&#8208;DCO, a cathepsin L (CTSL)&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe, engineered for targeted imaging of doxorubicin&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells (MCF&#8208;7/ADR). Capitalizing on the overexpression of CTSL in chemoresistant malignancies, FR&#8208;DCO integrates a CTSL&#8208;specific dipeptide substrate (Phe&#8208;Arg, FR) with a dicyanoisophorone (DCO) fluorophore, enabling fluorescence activation via a single&#8208;step enzymatic cleavage. Upon hydrolysis, FR&#8208;DCO transitions from an intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;quenched state to an activated DCO fluorophore, achieving a 12.8&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield. In vitro studies demonstrated both caveolin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis in MCF&#8208;7/ADR cells, yielding 2.3&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensity than its nonresistant counterparts (MCF&#8208;7 and 4T1). In vivo imaging in murine models revealed rapid and specific activation within drug&#8208;resistant tumors, with intratumoral fluorescence intensity doubling that of nonresistant lesions within 20&#160;minutes post&#8208;injection. Notably, dual&#8208;tumor xenograft models confirmed precise discrimination of MCF&#8208;7/ADR tumors from 4T1 tumors, highlighting the spatial resolution of the probe. This work not only provides a molecular tool for spatiotemporal resistance monitoring, but also establishes a modular design paradigm for enzyme&#8208;responsive probes targeting tumor microenvironment biomarkers, advancing precision oncology strategies.

         <title>Functionalized in Triplicate: A Ring&#8208;By&#8208;Ring Approach to Tailored Prodiginine Derivatives for Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation Through Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prodigiosin is a potent cytotoxic alkaloid but lacks target selectivity. We advance functionalization of all three pyrrole rings of prodigiosin to enable site&#8208;specific conjugation via click chemistry. The presented azide&#8208; and maleimide&#8208;functionalized prodiginines are suitable for generating covalent prodiginine conjugates and attaching auspicious vectors for targeted drug delivery. The developed methodology promotes the expansion of conjugable pyrrole&#8208;based building blocks and natural products in the future.








Abstract
The tripyrrole prototype alkaloid prodigiosin and members of the prodigiosin family are structurally diverse bacterial secondary metabolites. The privileged scaffold accounts for versatile biological activities, for example, antimicrobial, antitumoral, and immunosuppressive. Its Lewis&#8208;basic lipophilic tripyrrole core and the aliphatic side chains allow for passive membrane diffusion, thereby trespassing the natural permeability barrier. However, diffusion&#8208;controlled uptake is accompanied by low target specificity, hampering the development of tailored prodigiosin therapeutics and their selective delivery to target sites. To address this downside, this work focuses on providing the chemical methodology to synthesize prodiginines that are amenable to click chemistry on each of the three pyrrole moieties and facilitate the development of prodigiosin conjugates. Installing reactive azides and maleimides in the A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and C&#8208;ring of the cytotoxic scaffold enables further functionalization per azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC and SPAAC) and thiol&#8208;maleimide addition, giving rise to protein&#8208;conjugable prodiginines for the first time. The presented synthetic routes comprise yields of 3.24.7% over 1215 steps and grant access to valuable synthetic elements for expanding the toolbox of click chemistry to other pyrrole&#8208;, pyrrolidinone&#8208;, and tetramic acid&#8208;containing natural products. Together, the devised methodology for prodiginine derivatization will collectively advance the development of alkaloid&#8208;based conjugate therapeutics, eligible for target&#8208;selective delivery.

         <dc:description>
The reported aza&#8208;dibenzodiprromethenes present a rare helical architecture, placing terminal aryl groups in a close, &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement. Differentially terminated derivatives are prepared by statistical condensation or controlled synthesis via conversion of one partner to its tosylate or triflate. Borylation (BF3) is significantly improved by addition of TMS&#8208;Cl; an important protocol change that could improve general BODIPY syntheses. The alkene stereochemistry switches in the formed aza&#8208;BODIPYs, separating the termini.








Abstract
The dipyrromethenes (DPMs) and their borylated adducts (BODIPYs) constitute a class of versatile chromophores that has become one of the most widely studied over recent decades. They combine excellent photochemistry properties with opportunity for synthetic manipulation and tuning. We report here a related class of aza&#8208;dibenzodipyrromethenes and show that they present an interesting architecture where the core adopts a helical arrangement that places terminal aryl functional groups directly on top of each other in close, &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement. Complexation by reaction with boron trifluoride, demonstrated to be significantly improved by addition of trimethylsilyl chloride, induces a stereochemical inversion that destroys the helix, flattens the system, and switches on fluorescence. A wide range of terminal aromatic fragments can be easily introduced. Unsymmetrical derivatives can be made conveniently by simple mixed condensations, but a controlled, rational approach is also described whereby the ability of one component to homocondense (the more reactive partner) is removed by conversion to its corresponding tosylate or triflate. The two approaches have been investigated through successful introduction of complementary electron rich, electron poor, and &#960;&#8208;extended functional termini.

The synthesis and conformational analysis of pyran interhalides unveiled the shortest F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding involving Csp3&#8208;bound I and F atoms.








Abstract
There is growing interest in the preparation of multivicinal interhalide molecules. Herein, we described the synthesis of several pyran interhalide analogues of d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;mannose, d&#8208;talose, and d&#8208;glucose. A robust and simple halogeno&#8208;divergent strategy provided pyran&#8208;bearing multivicinal interhalide stereocenters. However, a different strategy was implemented for the synthesis of glucose interhalides. The solid&#8208;state conformational analysis of some interhalide analogues showed differences in the deviation of the intra&#8208;annular torsion angles. Moreover, we observed the shortest F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding (XB) involving Csp3&#8208;bound I and F atoms.

         <title>Exploring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded 3D MOFs: High&#8208;Performance, Thermally Stable Self&#8208;Assembled Iodine&#8208;Encapsulated Frameworks with Optimal Energetic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;based E&#8208;MOFs derived from TBTT were synthesized and evaluated for their energetic performance. These E&#8208;MOFs also exhibited promising iodine encapsulation ability, indicating their potential for dual energetic and environmental applications.








Abstract
Modern high&#8208;performing insensitive energetic materials are becoming more and more in demand to meet the growing needs of civilians and military applications. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of azole&#8208;based energetic molecules was described to construct potassium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;based energetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (E&#8208;MOFs) using polyazole&#8208;based energetic 5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;((1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)bis(1H&#8208;tetrazole) (TBTT) linker. The X&#8208;ray analysis authenticates K&#8208;MOF (1) and Na&#8208;MOF (2), introducing hydrogen&#8208;bonded 3D frameworks. Both compounds were extensively studied by thermogravimetric analysis&#8208;differential scanning calorimetry (TGA&#8208;DSC), elemental analysis (EA), infrared spectroscopy (IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses (PXRD). Further, mechanical sensitivity, detonation properties, and Hirshfeld surface analyses were examined. As expected, both E&#8208;MOFs showed excellent thermal decomposition temperature (Td = 333&#8211;387&#160;&#176;C), which exceeds benchmark explosives like hexahydro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (RDX) (210&#160;&#176;C), 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (318&#160;&#176;C), and 2,4,6&#8208;triamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trinitrobenzene (TATB) (315&#160;&#176;C). They also have shown high positive heat of formation (HOF&#160;=&#160;366&#8211;525&#160;kJ/mol) and superior detonation performance (VOD&#160;=&#160;6857&#8211;8903&#160;m/s; DP&#160;=&#160;17.41&#8211;28.23&#160;GPa). Additionally, the two E&#8208;MOFs exhibited low sensitivity toward impact sensitivity (IS &gt; 60&#160;J) and friction sensitivity (FS &gt; 360&#160;N), which may be attributed to strong structural reinforcement and multiple hydrogen bonding interactions, which is also proven by Hirshfeld surface analyses. Moreover, the high covalent bonds are beneficial in strengthening the E&#8208;MOF structures, which require high energy to collapse, thereby sustaining excellent thermal stability. E&#8208;MOFs 1 and 2 exhibit high iodine encapsulation and recyclability, maintaining effectiveness over six cycles, making them ideal for water remediation. Thus, compounds 1 and 2 can serve as promising next&#8208;generation highly thermally stable energetic materials, which can be a perfect replacement for currently used conventional explosives RDX, HNS, and TATB.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy for the synthesis of pyridinyl ketones from styrenes, 4&#8208;cyanopyridines, and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones is described. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photosensitizer&#8208;free protocol employs &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones as intrinsic photocatalysts, serving dually as acyl donors and reductants. The method features readily available substrates, broad functional group compatibility, high selectivity, and mild reaction conditions.








Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photosensitizer&#8208;free three&#8208;component acylpyridylation of styrenes is presented. In this strategy, &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones play a triple role: they act as visible&#8208;light&#8208;activated photosensitizers, acylation reagents, and reductants. This approach does not require transition&#8208;metals, external photosensitizers, or reductive reagent, demonstrating high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, and robust tolerance to various functional groups.

         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the relationship between charge localization and the second hyperpolarizability &#947; in the mixed&#8208;valence state of molecules with two equivalent redox centers by quantum chemical calculations. It was revealed that the sign of &#947; reverses and their absolute values become large near the charge localization boundary.








Abstract
Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valence systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#8226;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant variation&#160;of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.

         <title>The Versatility of Diazirines: Properties, Synthetic and Modern Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazirines are 3&#8208;membered heterocycles containing two nitrogen atoms connected by a double bond. They possess a multi&#8208;faceted reactivity that holds great potential for organic synthesis. This review discusses their properties, modes of activation, and their many modern uses, underlining their underappreciated versatility: as carbene precursors, but also as electrophilic nitrogen donors, as NMR hyperpolarization probes, or as molecular tools in materials science.








Abstract
Diazirines are 3&#8208;membered heterocycles containing two nitrogen atoms connected by a double bond. They are mostly known for their usage in photoaffinity labeling (PAL), due to their stability and their facile photolysis for on&#8208;demand carbene generation. Yet diazirines possess a multi&#8208;faceted reactivity that also holds great potential for organic synthesis. This is illustrated in the present review, which is meant to be a beginner's guide for new diazirine users. After briefly summarizing the main synthetic approaches to these derivatives (with a focus on recent improvements), we emphasize some of their most critical features and properties before describing the various modes of activation toward carbene generation, some of which were only uncovered in the past decade. We then review the many modern uses of diazirines, underlining their underappreciated versatility: as carbene precursors in synthesis, but also as electrophilic nitrogen donors, as NMR hyperpolarization probes, or as molecular tools in materials science.

         <title>Fluorinated Phenylazopyrazoles for Monitoring the Photoisomerization in Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated azopyrazole photoswitches can be obtained in a straightforward synthesis on a wide range of substrates and isomerize efficiently under light&#8208;irradiation. The molecular motion can be followed by 19F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy even in complex systems, such as dopants in vesicles. 








Abstract
Photoswitches have been impacting diverse areas of research, introducing means of dynamically regulating their environment through reversible photochemical isomerization. Among the different classes of photoswitches, phenylazopyrazoles (PAPs) stand out due to their facile synthesis, beneficial photochemical properties, and the long thermal stability of their metastable forms. Not surprisingly, they have been applied in different fields, from material sciences to pharmacology. However, once incorporated into complex systems, following the photoisomerization behavior of PAPs with routinely used analytical methods becomes challenging. In this work, we focused on synthesizing and studying the isomerization behavior of a series of differently substituted PAPs possessing two trifluoromethyl groups on the pyrazole moiety (F&#8208;PAPs). By studying their isomerization with steady&#8208;state and transient absorption spectroscopy, we found marked trends in the isomerization efficiency and photophysical properties of the different switches. Most importantly, these molecules can quantitatively isomerize between their stable and metastable forms, with relatively long lifetimes of thermal back relaxation. Leveraging these characteristics, we highlight in this work the potential application of F&#8208;PAPs as photoswitchable 19F&#8208;NMR probes to generate light&#8208;responsive vesicles.

         <title>Unraveling Structural Evolution of Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) with Co&#8208;N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co&#8208;HHTP) with Co&#8208;O units on carbon paper (CP) exhibit structural evolution into Co(OH)2 during catalytic process, which could promote the more favorable activation of *H2O and hydrogenation of *NO3 and *NO toward the wide&#8208;potential and high&#8208;yield electrochemical ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied for various complex electrocatalytic reactions, such as nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia. Currently, their real active sites are controversial due to the inevitable structure transformations of MOFs during the catalytic process, limiting the rational design of effective electrocatalysts. Here, we clarified the structural evolution of zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) with Co&#8208;N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co&#8208;HHTP) with Co&#8208;O units on carbon paper (CP) toward enhancing NO3RR. Both ZIF&#8208;67/CP and Co&#8208;HHTP/CP achieve NH3 Faradaic efficiencies more than 95% within the wide potential range of &#8208;0.2 to &#8208;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). At &#8208;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, they deliver NH3 yield rates of 87.41 and 79.11&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively, which outperform the most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Combining with in&#8208;situ Raman and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we verified the faster transformation of ZIF&#8208;67 into Co(OH)2 compared to Co&#8208;HHTP. The newly generated Co(OH)2 was recognized as the catalytic species and presented more favorable hydrogenation as elucidated by in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy. This work offers insightful understanding on the active phase of MOFs for designing reasonable active units toward different electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Ni&#9472;C Bond Formation via Selective Gas&#8208;Phase C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage in 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CID experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent the 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively), cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds, with the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#9472;C bonds.








Abstract
Mechanistic investigations into the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds to form M&#9472;C (M: metal) bonds are crucial for the comprehension, optimization, and design of chemical reactions. In this study, collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent a 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively), cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds, leading to the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#9472;C bonds. In contrast, the [NiL]+ cation, without the phen ligand, produces small neutral molecules, such as CH4, CO, and C6H6. Theoretical calculations suggest that a decarboxylation&#8208;like mechanism is responsible for the generation of the M&#9472;C bond in [(phen)Ni(bac)]+ (bac&#160;=&#160;benzoylacetone). Although the phen ligand is not directly involved in the fragmentation of nickel complex cations, it significantly alters the electronic structures and fragmentation mechanisms of nickel complex cations. This work presents a novel approach for the generation of M&#9472;C bonds through a gas&#8208;phase method and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds in homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Multifunctionality, Catalytic Mechanisms, and In Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer multifunctional platforms to suppress the shuttle effect, catalyze polysulfide conversion, and enable stable cycling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This review dissects their diverse roles, catalytic mechanisms, and the application of in situ techniques for mechanistic analysis&#8212;highlighting COFs as powerful enablers for advanced lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as polysulfide shuttle, sluggish redox kinetics, and electrode instability hinder their practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring high porosity, tunable functionality, and structural regularity, have emerged as versatile materials to address these issues. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in COF&#8208;based strategies for LSBs, including their multifunctional roles as sulfur hosts, separators/interlayers, and catalytic additives. The predominant catalytic mechanisms associated with COFs are further elucidated, with specific focus being placed on electrostatic field catalysis, supramolecular channel catalysis, redox&#8208;mediated catalysis, and metal&#8208;coordination catalysis. While conventional characterization techniques have been extensively described in previous reviews, particular emphasis is placed on the application of in situ characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), which offer mechanistic insights into COF&#8208;catalyzed polysulfide conversion.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer multifunctional platforms to suppress the shuttle effect, catalyze polysulfide conversion, and enable stable cycling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This review dissects their diverse roles, catalytic mechanisms, and the application of in situ techniques for mechanistic analysis&#8212;highlighting COFs as powerful enablers for advanced lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, challenges such as polysulfide shuttle, sluggish redox kinetics, and electrode instability hinder their practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring high porosity, tunable functionality, and structural regularity, have emerged as versatile materials to address these issues. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in COF-based strategies for LSBs, including their multifunctional roles as sulfur hosts, separators/interlayers, and catalytic additives. The predominant catalytic mechanisms associated with COFs are further elucidated, with specific focus being placed on electrostatic field catalysis, supramolecular channel catalysis, redox-mediated catalysis, and metal-coordination catalysis. While conventional characterization techniques have been extensively described in previous reviews, particular emphasis is placed on the application of in situ characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which offer mechanistic insights into COF-catalyzed polysulfide conversion. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8211;function&#8211;performance relationship of COFs and guide the rational design of next-generation COF-based materials for high-performance LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production via COFs represents a sustainable approach to addressing energy and environmental challenges. This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; generation using COFs, focusing on rational material design strategies and fundamental mechanisms. By combining photochemical principles with tailored COF design, this approach offers a sustainable route for solar&#8208;powered H&#8322;O&#8322; production.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a pivotal role in energy and environmental applications, but its industrial synthesis remains hampered by high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and safety risks. Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable alternative by leveraging solar energy to catalyze H2O2 production from oxygen and water. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts due to their well&#8208;defined structures and customizable active sites, enabling efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC). This review comprehensively explores recent progress in COF&#8208;mediated photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. It begins with an overview of photocatalytic principles, followed by a detailed analysis of reaction mechanisms and performance metrics for H2O2 generation. Emphasis is placed on tailored COF design strategies&#8212;such as electronic structure optimization and redox&#8208;active site engineering&#8212;to improve catalytic efficiency. Finally, we identify key challenges hindering the development of high&#8208;performance COFs photocatalysts tailored for sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; synthesis.

         <title>Chemical Fuel&#8208;Driven Networked Catalytic Machinery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A networked molecular machine has been developed where protonation&#8208;induced metal translocation activates catalysis in a time&#8208;programmed manner. A silver(I)&#8208;loaded receptor and a [2]rotaxane undergo a reversible cascade upon fuel addition, transiently switching on the catalytic cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldoxime.








Abstract
We present a pivotal advancement in networked molecular machinery by integrating chemical&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven communication and catalysis. When the self&#8208;sorted system of a zinc hexacyclen, a silver(I)&#8208;loaded receptor, and a [2]rotaxane (= NetState&#8208;I) was exposed to 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid as chemical fuel, the protonation first entailed a translocation of Zn2+ onto the receptor and, concomitantly, of silver(I) onto the [2]rotaxane, a cascade process that gradually reversed to the initial state. In the initial networked state, the silver(I) ions were tightly captured inside the receptor so that their catalytic activity was zero, while the transiently generated silver(I) [2]rotaxane (k298 = 176&#160;kHz) catalyzed the 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;alkynylbenzaldoxime. The pulsed operation of this networked catalytic machinery, driven by chemical fuel, presents a novel paradigm for cascaded signaling and time&#8208;programmed catalysis, mimicking the complexity of biological systems.

         <title>Spatially Coordinated Delivery of siRNA and Peptide Antagonist by Using Quantum Dots for Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present in this work a quantum&#8208;dot&#160;(QDs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for siRNA which shows pronounced improvements of stability against enzymatic degradation by ribonucleases, cellular uptake due to positively charge, and release from endosomes. The introduction of RNA&#8208;binding peptide to the QDs surface&#160;enables the dual delivery of the siRNA&#8208;peptide assembly. Briefly, EZH2&#8208;targeting peptide (EIP103) was first introduced to QDs surface via biotin&#8208;streptavidin interaction&#160;(PQDs), followed by incubation of siRNA that silences EZH2&#160;(siEZH2). The self&#8208;assembly of EIP103 and siEZH2&#160;on the QDs surface (RPQDs) was achieved via electrostatic attraction between the cationic EIP103 and the negatively charged siEZH2. The results revealed that the obtained RPQDs&#160;not only protect both EIP103 peptides and siEZH2 from enzymatic hydrolysis but also promote their endocytosis and endosome escape. This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual delivery and targeting of peptides and siRNA, offering a novel strategy for the synergistic cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>

         <dc:description>Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische&#8217;s allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence.

Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.</dc:description>

         <title>Implementation of the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base Principle for the Direct Synthesis of Bimetallic Zirconium&#8208;Nickel and Hafnium&#8208;Nickel Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with a Polar Pore Environment</title>

Successful implementation of the HSAB principle using a bifunctional pyrazole&#8208;carboxylic acid organic linker afforded in one&#8208;pot synthesis heterometallic (Zr/Ni and Hf/Ni) MOFs with a polar pore environment, suitable for gas separation applications.








Abstract
An important direction in MOFs is the development of materials with well&#8208;defined and ordered heterogeneity toward novel functionalities and control of important properties at the atomic scale. A great approach is the designed synthesis of mixed&#8208;metal MOFs (M'MOFs) made of different building units based on distinct metal cations. However, their in&#8208;situ formation and co&#8208;assembly into an extended crystalline framework present great challenges due to the different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We report the successful synthesis of two isostructural, bimetallic Zr&#8208;Ni and Hf&#8208;Ni M'MOFs following the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) principle. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of a 3D structure that features an in&#8208;situ formed [Ni(HPyC)4Cl2]4&#8722; 4&#8208;c nonplanar metallo&#8208;ligand that bridges 8&#8208;c Zr(Hf)6&#8208;clusters. The resulting (4, 8)&#8208;c scu&#8208;type framework shows polygonal 1D channels, with a largest pore diameter of approximately 9&#160;&#197;, decorated by Cl&#8722; anions. This polar pore environment was found fully accessible, and both materials were investigated for Xe/Kr and CO2/CH4 separation. The results are very promising, showing that the IAST selectivity calculated for a 20:80 Xe/Kr molar mixture is 8.2 and 7.1 at 298&#160;K for the Zr_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Hf_Ni&#8208;scu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, respectively, which is comparable to some of the best&#8208;performing materials.

     alt="Implementation of the Hard-Soft Acid-Base Principle for the Direct Synthesis of Bimetallic Zirconium-Nickel and Hafnium-Nickel Metal-Organic Frameworks with a Polar Pore Environment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful implementation of the HSAB principle using a bifunctional pyrazole-carboxylic acid organic linker afforded in one-pot synthesis heterometallic (Zr/Ni and Hf/Ni) MOFs with a polar pore environment, suitable for gas separation applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important direction in MOFs is the development of materials with well-defined and ordered heterogeneity toward novel functionalities and control of important properties at the atomic scale. A great approach is the designed synthesis of mixed-metal MOFs (M'MOFs) made of different building units based on distinct metal cations. However, their in-situ formation and co-assembly into an extended crystalline framework present great challenges due to the different kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We report the successful synthesis of two isostructural, bimetallic Zr-Ni and Hf-Ni M'MOFs following the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) principle. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of a 3D structure that features an in-situ formed [Ni(HPyC)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; 4-c nonplanar metallo-ligand that bridges 8-c Zr(Hf)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-clusters. The resulting (4, 8)-c &lt;b&gt;scu&lt;/b&gt;-type framework shows polygonal 1D channels, with a largest pore diameter of approximately 9&#160;&#197;, decorated by Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. This polar pore environment was found fully accessible, and both materials were investigated for Xe/Kr and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The results are very promising, showing that the IAST selectivity calculated for a 20:80 Xe/Kr molar mixture is 8.2 and 7.1 at 298&#160;K for the Zr_Ni-&lt;b&gt;scu&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-1 and Hf_Ni-&lt;b&gt;scu&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-1, respectively, which is comparable to some of the best-performing materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation of 2&#8208;Arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]Pyridines with Maleimides: Regioselectivity Switch and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report presents the first example of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed switch in regioselectivity during the annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, achieved under low catalyst loading (1.5 mol%). The observed switch in regioselectivity is attributed to the preferential activation of the pyridine&#8208;ring hydrogen over that of the aryl ring. Photophysical studies of the annulated products revealed impressive quantum yields of up to 0.78. Notably, compound 3ba exhibited 63% quenching of picric acid, underscoring its potential for sensing applications.








Abstract
Herein, we report a palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, representing the first example of the regioselectivity reversal for this class of substrates. Notably, the transformation proceeds efficiently with a low catalyst loading (1.5&#160;mol%). A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed, supported by control experiments and in situ HRMS analysis. Photophysical investigations of the annulated products reveal moderate to high quantum yields, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, these molecules demonstrate promising sensitivity as picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.

         <title>Redox Cycling at Tellurium: Selective and Multiple Activation of Si&#9472;H Bonds in Common Organosilanes and SiH4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] effectively activates the Si&#9472;H bonds of Et3SiH, Ph4&#8211;nSiHn (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3), SiH4, and complex H&#8208;siloxanes and catalytically converts them in the presence of quinones into siloxylated phenols of high interest for the chemical industry.








Abstract
Redox catalysis involving the tellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] was utilized for the activation of the common silanes Et3SiH, Ph4&#8211;nSiHn (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3) as well as the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle gaseous SiH4. Furthermore, complex siloxanes containing multiple Si&#9472;H bonds were converted into siloxylated phenols, which are of high interest for the chemical industry. Insights into the catalytic cycle utilizing para&#8208;quinones as both oxidants and substrates were provided by identification of key intermediates and by using in situ time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations. Based on this study, the catalytic cycle is initiated by a Si&#9472;H bond activation resulting in the formation of a ditelluride species and the corresponding silyl triflate. In turn, the ditelluride species is first oxidized by the presented quinone, forming an unprecedented tellurium&#8208;based oxonium intermediate, resulting in the formation of the siloxylated phenols and liberation of the tellurium catalyst upon subsequent reaction with the silyl triflate. Our proposed catalytic cycle can be generalized for any silane used in this study.

         <title>Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 and the Influence of Void Filling with Li in the Hcp Array of P Atoms on the Ionic Conductivity for X = 0 and 1 as well as Li2Sr2Al2P4</title>

         <dc:description>
The influence of void occupancies on the ionic conductivity of the novel Zintl phases Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li2Sr2Al2P4 is investigated. Their structures and structural relationships are discussed in detail and compared to the known Li4Sr2SiP4. Additionally, a solid solution between Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li4Sr2SiP4 is presented. Methods of investigation include X&#8208;ray diffraction, MAS NMR, impedance, and Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich ternary lithium phosphides have proven to be good model systems for ionic conductivity, achieving lithium&#8208;ion conductivities up to 4.5 mS/cm (&#969;&#8208;Li9GaP4). Compounds in which lithium is partially substituted by alkaline&#8208;earth metals bear the possibility of vacancy generation and thus the possibility to reach better ion conductivity and also to gain further insight into structure&#8208;property relationships. Based on the recent report on the quaternary compound Li4Sr2SiP4, we investigated the substitution of Si by Al and found the new compounds Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li2Sr2Al2P4. The examination of the solid solution Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;x SixP4 for x =&#160;0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, and 1.0 resulted in a series of crystalline materials that adopt two different structure types in dependency of x. Compounds crystallize either in space group P3&#175;$\bar{3}$;m1 (No.&#160;164) (Li5Sr2AlP4, Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 with x&#160;&lt;&#160;0.5) or in space group P21/m (No.&#160;11) (Li2Sr2Al2P4, Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 with x&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.5). Li5Sr2AlP4 is structurally related to Li4Sr2SiP4 but exhibits an additional statistical disorder of Al and Li atoms, which is also found in Li2Sr2Al2P4.

         <title>Crystal Structure of Carbonic Acid (H2CO3) at Elevated Pressures from Single&#8208;Crystal Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonic acid (H2CO3) was synthesized by a reaction of H2O with CO2 at moderate pressures and temperatures. For the first time, the crystal structure of an H2CO3 polymorph was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structural model was confirmed by DFT&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Single crystals of carbonic acid (H2CO3) were synthesized in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell at moderate pressures between 5 and 13&#160;GPa by reacting H2O with CO2. Its monoclinic crystal structure (P21/n with Z = 4) has been obtained from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments at &#8776;8&#160;GPa. The positions of the hydrogen atoms have been determined from the experimental data. Density functional theory&#8208;based calculations in combination with experimental Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural model derived from the diffraction data. This is the first single&#8208;crystal structure solution of water&#8208;free carbonic acid, H2CO3. The structural model provided here differs from structural models reported earlier for lower pressures derived from neutron powder diffraction&#160;data.

         <title>Phase Selective Synthesis of SBT and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS Intergrown Zeolites Using Asymmetric Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents for Upgrading of Polyethylene Pyrolysis Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBT zeolites and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS triple intergrowth zeolites were synthesized using three asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts as structure&#8208;directing agents. The FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowth exhibited higher selectivities for ethylene and propylene than that of Y zeolite in catalytic upgrading of polyethylene pyrolysis oil, owing to presence of more strong acid sites.








Abstract
Organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) based on asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonia compounds have been rarely explored in crystallization of zeolites, owing to difficulties in structural control. Their use holds promise to regulate physicochemical properties of zeolitic materials toward enhancing the relevant catalytic performances. In this study, a stepwise alkylation of 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dab) to generate asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary derivatives has been established, enabling their use as OSDAs in large pore zeolite synthesis. Through exploratory syntheses, we showed that small Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;Et can direct the formation of SBT zeolite in multiple inorganic cation (Cs+&#9472;Na+) crystallization, while the bulky Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;iPr and Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;sBu lead to the formation of FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowths. The obtained SBT zeolite exhibited higher olefin selectivity in catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil derived from polyethylene, with respect to alike cage&#8208;containing faujasite (FAU) zeolite. Our findings expand the library of asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and highlight their capability to achieve phase selective synthesis of large pore zeolites.

         <title>Catalytic Oxidation of Naphthalene and Polycyclic Arenes by Iron(III) TAML/H2O2 in Water Aiming at Their Efficient Removal from Aqua Natural Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TAML in the presence of hydrogen peroxide efficiently catalyzes the oxidative degradation of naphthalene in aqueous medium of neutral pH. Products are identified and key mechanistic features are discussed.








Abstract
The electron transfer from naphthalene at an oxidized iron TAML species (TAML&#160;=&#160;tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) is a key step of its environmentally relevant deep degradation by hydrogen peroxide in water leading first to naphthoquinones which are further converted to smaller fragments. Other polycyclic arenes are also oxidized, often faster than naphthalene consistent with their lower ionization potentials than that of naphthalene.

Abstract
We report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium catalyzed trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;). This is the first ever report on trifluoromethylation using in situ generated N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate as the CF3 source under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The present one&#8208;pot transformation enabled direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers. It has also shown a remarkable compatibility toward aroyltrifluoroborates for the mechanochemical synthesis of aryl trifluoromethyl ketones. This method offers several advantages, including operational simplicity and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the current mechanochemical approach not only proceeds under sustainable conditions but also provides a practical route for the late&#8208;stage modifications of related substrates to access the valuable fluorinated compounds.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Mn2+/Octadecylamine Codecorated Carbon Dots with Ultrabroadband Yellow Emission for High&#8208;CRI White LEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the synergy of Mn2+ and ODA codecoration, CDs with ultrabroadband and efficient yellow fluorescence in the solid state were synthesized through a simple one&#8208;step solvothermal process. These synthetic phosphors exhibit a production yield of 80%, an FWHM of 98&#160;nm, and a solid&#8208;state quantum yield up to 62.8%, allowing for high&#8208;CRI white LEDs in green and health lighting.








Abstract
Exploiting environment&#8208;friendly and efficient phosphors is crucial to constructing high&#8208;quality and sustainable white light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Vacuum Condensation of Hybrid Polymeric Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Extended Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vacuum condensation route was developed to synthesize g&#8208;CN with a hybrid polymeric structure, consisting of melon&#8208;type chains combined with completely condensed domains. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated system can be effectively extended for more efficient visible&#8208;light absorption and exciton dissociation, leading to a significantly improved hydrogen evolution activity, particularly in the extended spectral region up to 520&#160;nm.








Abstract
Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) has attracted considerable attention as a promising photocatalyst; however, its practical application is still hindered by the poor visible&#8208;light absorption and rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Herein, we report a vacuum&#8208;condensation approach for synthesizing g&#8208;CN with a hybrid polymeric structure that contains melon&#8208;type chains combined with completely condensed domains, which induces a notable structural disorder with the N/C atomic ratio less than 1.5 (the nominal value of melon). This hybrid polymeric structure intrinsically extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the heptazine&#8208;based framework, narrows its band gap, accelerates the exciton dissociation, and thus substantially improves its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Compared to the counterparts synthesized under inert atmospheres (N2 and Ar), the vacuum&#8208;polycondensed g&#8208;CN exhibits a threefold enhancement for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. In particular, its PHE activity can be effectively maintained under the light wavelength extended to 520&#160;nm. This work presents a promising strategy to break through the limitation of linear polymerization pathway during the conventional g&#8208;CN synthesis and offers new opportunities for rational design of more efficient g&#8208;CN&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning NIR Absorption and Emission of Diphenyl&#8208;Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Merocyanines with Ultra Narrow Band Gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel merocyanine derivatives with a strong diphenyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine donor and a series of strong electron acceptors were developed. The indanone and indandione acceptor units were modified by dicyanovinylene groups to tune acceptor strength. Among these derivatives, DPPZ&#8208;IDD realized an ultranarrow electrochemical gap of 0.93 eV and an optical band gap of 1.09 eV. Fluorescence in the visible to NIR region was also achieved in solution and solid states.








Abstract
Five merocyanine derivatives with a 5,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine donor and various indanone&#8208;and indandione based&#8208;acceptors with one or two dicyanovinylene groups were prepared by Knoevenagel condensation for tuning absorption and fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region. Molecular conformation, bond length alternation, and molecular packing in the solid state were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction of single crystals in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By enhancing electron&#8208;accepting ability, a considerable decrease of lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) energy by 1.01 eV and retained highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) energy within 0.13 eV were estimated by cyclic and rotating disc electrode voltammetry, relating semi&#8208;quantitatively to DFT prediction. Optical properties in solutions with various polarity, neat amorphous films, and crystalline powder states were studied. The absorption maxima of the neat films evolved from 545 nm to 931 nm. An ultranarrow optical band gap of DPPZ&#8208;IDD (1.09 eV) was found from the onset of thin film absorption and well agreed with the electrochemical gap of 0.93 eV. Detectable fluorescence in the NIR region was observed in the film and polycrystalline powder states.

         <title>Impact of Oxygen and Sulfur Heteroatom Core Substitution on Catalyst Properties of Phenoxazines and Their Performance in Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenoxazine core structural modification reveals the impact of charge transfer on stronger excited state reduction potentials. We observed that modifying the core of a photocatalyst that does not exhibit charge transfer yields a highly reducing singlet excited state reduction potential compared to a charge transfer equivalent.








Abstract
Phenoxazines are a successful class of organic photoredox catalysts (PCs) with tunable redox and photophysical properties. Originally, we aimed to realize more reducing phenoxazine PCs through heteroatom core substituted (HetCS) derivatives, while maintaining an efficiently oxidizing PC&#183;+. However, core modification with thioether or ether functionality to a PC that exhibits photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (CT) negligibly alters the singlet excited state reduction potential (ES1&#176;*), while yielding a less oxidizing PC&#183;+ (E1/2) (E1/2&#160;=&#160;0.50&#8211;0.64&#160;V vs. SCE) compared to the noncore modified PC 1 (0.68&#160;V vs. SCE). Photophysical characterization of HetCS PCs revealed that increasing electron density on the core of a CT exhibiting PC stabilizes the emissive state and PC&#183;+, resulting in a relatively unchanged ES1&#176;* compared to PC 1. In contrast, modifying the core of a PC that does not exhibit CT yields a highly reducing ES1&#176;* (PC 3 = &#8722;2.48&#160;V vs. SCE) compared to its CT equivalent (PC 1d = &#8722;1.68&#160;V vs. SCE). The impact of PC property on photocatalytic ability was evaluated through organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP). HetCS PCs were able to yield poly(methyl methacrylate) with low dispersity and moderate targeted molecular weight as evaluated by initiator efficiency (I*) in DMAc (&#208; = 1.20&#8211;1.26; I* = 47&#8211;57%). Ultimately, this work provides insight into how phenoxazine PC properties are altered through structural modification, which can inform future PC design.

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning of Physicochemical Properties of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes Introducing Fluorine Atom(s) on the Building Blocks Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated oxetane derivatives garner significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse bioisosteric possibilities for potential applications in medicinal chemistry. We developed robust methodologies for the synthesis of 3&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted oxetanes, leveraging nucleophilic substitution, deoxy&#8208; and deoxofluorination, as well as fluoroiodination as key steps of introduction of fluorine atoms directly to the oxetane core or adjacent alkyl groups. Optimized reaction sequences enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various small building blocks, i.e. amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc. Physicochemical studies revealed that fluorination significantly impacts acidity, with oxetane derivatives demonstrating the decrease of pKa values on up to three units in the case of replacement of gem&#8208;dimethyl, cyclopropyl&#8208; or cyclobutylidene moieties. These findings underscore the utility of fluorinated oxetanes as versatile building blocks for future applications in drug design and advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Harnessing secondary energy sources for water electrolysis to generate &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is instrumental in constructing a zero&#8208;carbon&#8208;emission hydrogen value chain. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a bottleneck due to its complex four&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Investigation of high&#8208;performance anodic OER catalysts has been developed into a hot research field. The high kinetic barrier associated with OER is strongly linked to the interplay between singlet state of OH&#8722;/H2O and triplet state of O2, this interconversion process is significantly influenced by the spin states of metal centers in catalysts. In this short review, the fundamental mechanisms of spin effects in oxygen evolution are briefly discussed with respect to the thermodynamics, active species formation, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, the recent approaches to modulate spin configuration of electrocatalysts are summarized, such as lattice substitution, defect engineering, interface regulation, ligand adsorption, and size modulation. In last section, the challenges and perspectives for future development of spin&#8208;related catalysis are discussed, aiming to provide insights into spin effects in water oxidation and guidance for designing efficient OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Sodium&#8208;Ion Conducting Sulfonated Polytriazole and Composite Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The table of contents illustrates the structural engineering of the polymer electrolytes, which results in a self&#8208;assembled, phase&#8208;separated morphology. This morphology resulted&#160;in enhanced solvent absorption and wettability, which in turn leads to improved ionic conductivity that is suitable for alkali metal battery applications.








Abstract
The ongoing energy crisis and the increasing demand for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have raised concerns about the availability and affordability of lithium. In light of their abundance and lower production costs, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have the potential to replace LMBs. However, due to the reactivity of organic electrolytes with the sodium anode, it is essential to design safer electrolytes to prevent short&#8208;circuiting. This study focuses on the design and evaluation of fillers and single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs), including sodium salt of sulfonated graphene oxide (Na&#8208;SGO), sulfonated polytriazole (PTSICPE&#8208;90), and various blend composites, which outperform Celgard 2400 in terms of thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. The Na&#8208;SGO filler demonstrated a desirable Na&#8208;ion conductivity of 11.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 Scm&#8722;1 at 90 &#176;C in a solvated state. Due to the high solvent absorption (70&#160;wt.%), good wettability (22.2&#176;), and significant porosity (58%) of the SICPEs, notable Na&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (nonsolvated at 30 &#176;C) and 1.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (solvated at 40 &#176;C) were observed. These properties make them an appealing choice for electrolytic applications in SMBs.

         <title>Bis(phenylsulfonyl)Methane (BPSM) as Multifunctional Electrolyte Additive Constructing a Stable Interfaces for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Graphite Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) as an electrolyte additive enhances the performance of NCM811/graphite batteries. BPSM facilitates the formation of a more stable interfacial film on the electrode surface. The available data demonstrate that the capacity retention of the battery at low temperature is significantly improved. BPSM showcases potential as an influential additive for NCM811/graphite batteries under the condition of low temperature.








Abstract
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) is used as a functional electrolyte additive to assist in the construction of stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial films to improve the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite batteries at room and low temperatures and compared to the non&#8208;BPSM&#8208;containing batteries, rate and cycling performance of BPSM&#8208;containing batteries can also be enhanced. After 1200 cycles at 25 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 8.68% to 83.07%. After 130 cycles at &#8722;10 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 21.01% to 98.97%. The spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that BPSM is preferentially oxidized and reduced on the cathode and anode, respectively, to construct stable and high&#8208;conductivity electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The enhanced performance reveals that BPSM is an effective film&#8208;forming additive with promising applications in nickel&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Regulated &#914;&#8208;Phase Crystallization of Strong and Tough Polypropylene Through Hyperbranched Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the regulating crystallization and morphology of &#946;&#8208;nucleated PP with a HBPN and provides a new perspective on toughening polypropylene using hyperbranched topology.








Abstract
Achieving both enhanced strength and improved toughness of polypropylene (PP) remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. The present study addresses this limitation by constructing a robust crystalline network through the strategic integration of hyperbranched topology. We demonstrate that a hyperbranched nucleating agent (HBPN) effectively induces high&#8208;content &#946;&#8208;crystal formation in PP, which organizes into an interconnected crystalline architecture. This &#946;&#8208;phase network significantly enhances the mechanical performance of PP, with tensile strength and notched impact strength increasing by 35.78% (to 42.5&#160;MPa) and 140% (to 13.2 KJ/m2), respectively, compared to pure PP. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergy between strength and toughness originates from HBPN mediated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization, which refines the morphology of spherulites and increases the degree of crystallinity. The hyperbranched topology of HBPN inhibits entangled PP chains and facilitates crystallization of PP chains. Thus, it contributes to efficient stress redistribution by dissipating localized energy through multidirectional load transfer, while arresting crack advancement via microvoid&#8208;induced stress relaxation. This work demonstrates an effective conceptual approach to engineering high&#8208;performance PP, unlocking its potential for various value&#8208;added applications.

A Ni0 atom is fixed into a nine atomic germanium cluster core and remains active in the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene. This clearly confirms the idea to use Zintl cluster as support material for catalytically active transition metals.








Abstract
Homogeneous catalytic reactions performed without or with highly abundant transition metals is an increasing field of research due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability. Therefore, using main group element Zintl cluster as support material for transition metals via synthesizing single site homogeneous catalysts (SSHoC) could be a way to make such metals feasible for catalysis, without the risk of metal loss or agglomeration like in classical single site catalysts. A synthetic protocol for four cluster compounds K[Hyp3Ge9Ni(PR3)] (Hyp&#160;=&#160;Si{SiMe3}3; R&#160;=&#160;Ph, ptolyl, iPr, Me, 1&#8211;4) is presented, in which the nickel atom is embedded into the cluster core. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI/MS as well as for 1 and 3 by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination comprising a closo&#8208;[Ge9Ni] core. The cleavage of the triphenylphosphine ligand in 1 in THF, with and without 2.2.2&#8208;crypt, and acetonitrile as well as the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene in the same solvents have been investigated via NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Fe3+ Oxidation Strategy Enhances the Nonradiative Transition Ability of a Near&#8208;Infrared BODIPY Photosensitizer for Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing near&#8208;infrared photothermal reagents with intramolecular charge transfer properties using high&#8208;priced metal oxides, effective killing of tumor cells was achieved.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizer NIR&#8208;2BDP is constructed through an Fe3+ oxidation strategy. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that intramolecular charge separation effectively reduces the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, broadens the light absorption range, and suppresses radiative transition (RT) processes. The decrease in the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of NIR&#8208;2BDP (the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (S1&#8594;T1) is 2.5 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP, and the singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield is 2.1 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP). The low RT (only 2.2% fluorescence quantum yield) and relatively low triplet generation (11.7% 1O2 quantum yield) suggest that NIR&#8208;2BDP should have a stronger contribution of nonradiative transition (NRT) processes (and hence a higher photothermal conversion capability). Nanoparticles constructed from NIR&#8208;2BDP and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 exhibit good photothermal conversion efficiency (41.4%) and killing efficiency to tumor cells in the NIR&#8208;II window (1000&#8208;1700&#160;nm). Therefore, this study extends the sensitization window and improves the NRT ability, paving the way for the construction of multi&#8208;functional NIR BODIPY&#8208;like photosensitizers.

         <title>New Click on the Block: Photocaged Hydroxylamine, an Addition to the Light&#8208;Activatable Bioorthogonal Toolbox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retro&#8208;Cope bioorthogonal reactivity of hydroxylamines was disabled transiently with a coumarin photolabile protecting group, which could be recovered upon removal of the protecting group by a short, 400 nm light illumination. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated in bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling schemes of intracellular proteins in live cells.








Abstract
A new photoactivatable bioorthogonal function was added to the photoactivatable bioorthogonal toolbox by transiently disabling the bioorthogonal reactivity of the hydroxylamine moiety with a photolabile protecting group. The photocaged bioorthogonal function was further equipped with a HaloTag substrate to enable its use in live&#8208;cell labeling schemes. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated by bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling of intracellular proteins in live cells.

         <title>Constructing Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Systems with High&#8208;Contrast Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Through a Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient phosphorescent systems are constructed by doping weakly emissive hosts and guests. The doping systems exhibit high&#8208;contrast multi&#8208;stimuli response in both fluorescence and phosphorescence, which is rarely reported.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted significant attention because of their potential applications in information storage, bioimaging, sensors, among others. However, the design of high&#8208;performance stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP materials remains challenging. In this work, multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP systems are constructed by utilizing the acid&#8208;base responsive properties of the pyridine group, the heavy&#8208;atom effect of halogen and sulfur atoms, and d&#8208;p&#960; bonds. Six phenothiazine derivatives are designed and synthesized. A systematic investigation is conducted on the effects of molecular structure, molecular conformation, stacking arrangements, and intermolecular interactions on their luminescence properties. Employing phenothiazine derivatives as the guest and their corresponding 5,5&#8208;dioxide phenothiazine derivatives as the host, host&#8208;guest doping is achieved through the slow solvent evaporation and the melting&#8208;blending methods. The host&#8208;guest doping system exhibits highly efficient and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence through the formation of triplet exciplexes, with a phosphorescence quantum yield of up to 63.6%. The doping systems exhibit higher&#8208;contrast acid&#8208;base, acid&#8208;thermal, and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive luminescence characteristics than the single compounds. The potential applications of these systems in sensors, multicolor patterning, and multi&#8208;information encryption are explored.

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active H6HHTP ligand is isolated in two redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand allows accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes, increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system.








Abstract
A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8722;/cat2&#8722; couples of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.

         <title>Nucleophilic Addition versus Migratory Insertion Pathways in the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Heck Reaction: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction&#8221; could in principle proceed either via nucleophilic attack by triflate, or by migratory alkene insertion. This DFT study shows that nucleophilic attack is strongly preferred but ligand dependent.








Abstract
The initial reaction steps in the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalyzed by P^N chelated Au(III) complexes have been studied computationally. Two mechanistic alternatives have been explored: (1) alkene coordination and insertion into a gold&#8208;carbon bond, and (2) nucleophilic attack on a gold(III) alkene adduct. The common starting point, the [(P^N)AuPh(alkene)]2+ dication (alkene&#160;=&#160;C2H4, H2C&#9552;CHEt, or H2C&#9552;CEt2), shows unequal bonding to the olefinic carbons of the 1&#8208;alkenes (P^N&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;C6H4NMe2(PR2); R&#160;=&#160;H, Me, 1&#8208;adamantyl). This polarization increases with steric hindrance and with the inclusion of an OTf&#8208; anion in the model. While the reaction pathways are strongly governed by the trans&#8208;influence of the ligand, the effects of steric hindrance in the ligand and alkene are remarkably small. In all cases the nucleophilic attack pathway is energetically favored. However, changing the ligand from a P^N to a P^P chelate, with a strongly electron&#8208;donating &#8208;PMe2 donor trans to Ph, sufficiently destabilizes the Au&#9472;Ph bond to make alkene insertion competitive. Alkene 1,2&#8208;insertion regiochemistry is always preferred, unlike Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction that requires a 2,1&#8208;insertion. Based on these results, an alkene insertion pathway en route to Heck&#8208;type olefins can therefore be ruled out.

         <title>Ca2+ Stabilized by Carborate Anions: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium salts consisting of Ca2+ weakly coordinated by carborate counterions have been prepared through anhydrous and aqueous methods. The Ca2+ center is sufficiently Lewis acidic to weakly coordinate olefins, alkynes and aromatics, and catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes.








Abstract
The syntheses of calcium carborates, Ca[HexCB11Cl11]2, 1, Ca[HCB11Cl11]2, 2, and Ca[MeCB11Cl11]2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), 3&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB), (o&#8208;DFB&#160;=&#160;1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene) including the structure of 2&#183;4(o&#8208;DFB) are described. The large size of the Ca2+ cation is reflected by the coordination geometry with the Ca center being coordinated by three Cl donors from each of the carborate anions and one F donor from each of the two coordinated solvent molecules. Based on 11B NMR and DOSY NMR studies, the salts 1, 2 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) form close ion pairs in PhBr and o&#8208;DFB solutions. The Fluoride Ion Affinities (FIA) in PhBr for the salts 1 and 2&#183;2(o&#8208;DFB) were DFT&#8208;calculated (&#969;B97XD/6&#8211;31&#160;+&#160;G**) at 211.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 and 217.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, which is below that of the landmark Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (241.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). The Ca2+ center in salt 1 is sufficiently Lewis acidic to coordinate 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene (1,5&#8208;COD) and 2,6&#8208;octadiyne and to catalyze the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;hexene and several alkynes, albeit slowly. Compound 1 also displays moderate activity as a catalyst for transfer hydrogenation catalysis and carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (COM), a first for Ca compounds.

A double click&#8208;strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8208;Alder reactions involving a reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained diene is reported. Three different one&#8208;pot protocols (i.e., sequential or three&#8208;component reactions) are proposed and offer valuable guidance for future applications. The reactions are performed under mild conditions (37 &#176;C in H2O/iPrOH for 1&#8208;2&#160;hours) and can afford the desired bioconjugates in good overall isolated yields. Successfully applied on small peptides, the method demonstrates its efficiency and interest toward applications in chemical biology.








Abstract
We report an efficient double&#8208;click strategy combining copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with (thia&#8208;)Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reactions, enabled by newly designed heterobifunctional platforms bearing orthogonal clickable groups: alkyne&#8211;dithioester, alkyne&#8211;maleimide, or azide&#8211;diene. These platforms were evaluated through both one&#8208;pot sequential protocols (CuAAC/DA or CuAAC/thia&#8208;DA) and three&#8208;component reactions (3CR), using model substrates with complementary functionalities. The use of a highly reactive s&#8208;cis&#8208;constrained exocyclic diene, enabled rapid cycloadditions with maleimide or phosphonodithioester dienophiles. All reactions were performed under mild, biocompatible conditions (37&#160;&#176;C, 1:1 H&#8322;O/iPrOH, 1&#8211;2&#160;hours), and most afforded the desired conjugates in good isolated yields. The methodology was further validated through the successful bioconjugation of three small peptides with either a fluorophore or biotin, demonstrating its efficiency, versatility, and compatibility with biologically relevant functional groups.

         <title>Supramolecular Polyelectrolyte Film for Spontaneous Electricity Generation With Photoresponsive Output Signals and Intrinsic Recyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an alternative new type of spontaneous moisture electricity generator, a recyclable polyelectrolyte film was developed by the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of LA and polyelectrolyte HA, with an azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid. This film can absorb ambient moisture and induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow, thereby enabling electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals.








Abstract
Developing recyclable polymeric films for spontaneous power generation with stimuli&#8208;responsive output signals is a significant step toward sustainable wearable sensors, fashion textiles, etc., which remains highly challenging. Herein, we developed polyelectrolyte films for moisture&#8208;sorption&#8208;based electricity generation with photoresponsive electrical output signals from supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of alkaline solutions of lipoic acid (LA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with amphiphilic azobenzene dopant and ionic liquid via an evaporation&#8208;induced polymerization process. Due to the intrinsic hygroscopic property and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer structure with water channels, the corresponding polyelectrolyte films can absorb ambient moisture to induce charged ion dissociation and ion flow in the water channels, enabling spontaneous electricity generation. The polyelectrolyte film (0.4&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;1.5&#160;cm) generated currents up to 11.8 nA at ambient conditions (21.6&#176;C and 69% RH). Notably, an immediate increase of current signal was observed by exposure to UV light because of variations in molecular geometry and polarity of the azobenzene dopant between trans and cis isomers. Besides, the polyelectrolyte films were easily recycled by dissolving in water and subsequent re&#8208;evaporation. The results demonstrated a new and simple pathway for developing recyclable supramolecular materials featuring spontaneous electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals, providing attractive opportunities for future sustainable advanced materials.

Besides, the polyelectrolyte films were easily recycled by dissolving in water and subsequent re-evaporation. The results demonstrated a new and simple pathway for developing recyclable supramolecular materials featuring spontaneous electricity generation with photoresponsive output signals, providing attractive opportunities for future sustainable advanced materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Supramolecular System of Bioactive Ionic Liquid, Peony Extract, and Peptide for Enhanced Permeability and Synergistic Skincare Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a sustainable supramolecular system composed of naturally derived ingredients: PE, AHP8, and a bioactive ionic liquid from betaine and MA, which offers multiple anti&#8208;aging benefits while promoting skin permeability.








Abstract
The growing demand for safe and sustainable cosmetics has led to a marked inclination toward natural extracts and peptides as raw materials. In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple antiaging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide&#8208;8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid (MA) ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration, but also exerts synergistic anti&#8208;aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti&#8208;wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.

         <title>Highly Stable Sp2 Conjugated Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastable redox&#8208;acitve PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF has been synthesized for sustainable energy storage, with more than 100% capacitance retention even after 5000 charging/discharging cycles during the electrochemical process.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with reversible redox&#8208;active units are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. The highly extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated redox&#8208;active PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF is synthesized via Schiff&#8208;base condensation between p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPDA) and 2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;(p&#8208;formylphenoxy)1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) monomers. The ample redox active sites of PPDA&#8208;TFPT&#8208;COF enabled exceptional energy storage, achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 250 F g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 34.72&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 current density. The material demonstrated extraordinary cycling stability, retaining over 100% capacitance after 5000 cycles at 7 A g&#8722;1 current density. This superior performance is attributed to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, abundant redox&#8208;active centers, and an efficient charge transport pathway, making it an ideal supercapacitor electrode material. The presence of diamine moieties enhanced conductivity, while redox&#8208;active imine sites facilitated hydrogen ion storage. Electrochemical investigations under acidic conditions revealed significant perturbations in the electronic structure, elucidating the redox charge storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirmed extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation in HOMO and LUMO orbitals, providing key insights into charge mobility. This study presents a novel strategy for designing redox&#8208;active COFs for high&#8208;performance pseudocapacitive energy storage.

         <title>The Ascent of Supramolecular Polymers and Gels in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SPs and gels emerged as modular platforms for asymmetric catalysis. This review ranks literature reports according to the achiral or chiral nature of the monomers bearing the catalytic site. New paradigms showcased by this approach are particularly highlighted, such as catalysts operating with a low amount of chiral inducers, or with no chiral inducer, and the development of switchable asymmetric catalysts.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) and gels, formed by the spontaneous assembly of small molecules through various types of noncovalent interactions, are attractive materials for many applications. Their modularity also offers many opportunities in asymmetric catalysis that have been tackled in the last two decades and more intensively in the last one. In this review, strategies adopted to develop efficient asymmetric catalysts supported on SPs and gels are first categorized according to the chiral or achiral nature of the monomers used for their construction and second to their ability to be commuted into different states. Catalytic SPs have been described for which enantioselectivity stems mostly from the molecular chirality located next to the reactive group, or at opposite ends of the spectrum, exclusively from the chiral environment provided by the supramolecular helices. New paradigms revealed by these systems include (i) the organization of catalytic sites at the periphery of modular and well&#8208;structured 1D assemblies, (ii) the possibility to conduct asymmetric reactions with a sub&#8208;catalytic amount of chiral inducers and even in the absence of chiral monomers, and (iii) the development of a new class of switchable asymmetric catalysts.

         <title>Perspectives of Soft Lattice Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts, Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;activity relationship between the microstructure of MHPs and various photocatalytic properties was prospected, including excited state structural distortion, energy level rearrangement, and ion doping.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in lead&#8208;free perovskite materials (LFPMs). By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Advances in Copper and Nickel C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O Cross&#8208;Couplings of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ancillary Ligand Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important recent advances in ancillary ligand design that enable superlative copper or nickel catalyst systems for C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of inexpensive and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple thermal conditions are discussed.








Abstract
The evolution of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;N and C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling chemistry into first&#8208;choice methods for the synthesis of aniline and phenol derivatives can be attributed to innovations in ancillary ligand design that facilitate challenging elementary steps of thermal catalysis. Inspired by this strategy, and in the quest to establish more sustainable thermal base metal catalysis that is competitive with and complementary to such precious metal protocols, several successful mechanism&#8208;inspired ancillary ligand classes for use in enabling high&#8208;performing copper and nickel catalysts have emerged over the last decade. In this Review we document key ancillary ligand advances of this type, with a focus on superlative copper and nickel catalysts that enable C&#9472;N or C&#9472;O cross&#8208;couplings of cheap and abundant (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles under operationally simple conditions of relevance to end&#8208;users in academia and industry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Chlorination and Bromination of Pyrazolopyridines and Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report electrophilic ring&#8208;opening halogenation of pyrazolopyridines and isoxazoles. Selective cleavage of C&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds enables the synthesis of tertiary chlorinated and brominated compounds under mild conditions.








Abstract
We report the development of electrophilic ring&#8208;opening chlorination and bromination reactions of pyrazoloazines and isoxazoles using chlorinating and brominating agents. These transformations proceed via selective cleavage of heteroaromatic N&#9472;N or N&#9472;O bonds, delivering structurally diverse tertiary halogenated compounds. Furthermore, treatment of formylated pyrazolopyridines with two equivalents of chlorinating or brominating agents afforded dihalogenated products in good yields. This strategy represents a valuable platform for constructing halogenated scaffolds from simple heteroaromatic precursors and broadens the synthetic utility of skeletal transformations in the functionalization of heteroaromatics.

Abstract
[{Cp'Fe(&#956;&#8208;I)}2] (I; Cp&#8217; = &#951;5&#8211;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2) reacts with [Na(OCP)(1,4&#8208;dioxane)x] and K(OCAs) to yield [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;P2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (1) and [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;As2)(&#956;&#8208;CO)] (3), respectively. While complex 1 was previously accessed by Scherer and co&#8208;workers using rather harsh reaction conditions, the new synthetic method already proceeds at ambient temperature. UV&#8208;light irradiation of 1 and 3 induces CO release forming complexes [(Cp'Fe)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E2)] (E&#160;=&#160;P (2) and As (4)), respectively. However, both reactions also yielded several byproducts which were spectroscopically identified. Furthermore, upon thermally triggered CO elimination from 3 the Fe3As6&#8208;cluster [(Cp'Fe)3(As3)2] (5) is isolated in low yield. In addition, zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra were recorded on complexes 1&#8211;4 and computational studies complement the experimental findings and provide additional insights into the bonding in these complexes and the reaction pathways resulting in the formation of complexes 1&#8211;4.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and in Vitro Selection of De Novo Thiazole&#8208;Containing Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone Thz moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. Here, we report an in vitro selection platform for Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides, established through a posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand development in pseudo&#8208;natural peptide discovery.








Abstract
Backbone thiazole (Thz) moieties prevail in bioactive peptidic natural products and play important roles in their biological functions. However, the de novo discovery of artificial Thz&#8208;containing peptide ligands remains challenging. Here, we report an mRNA display&#8208;based selection platform for Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptides (ThzteMP), established through a dedicated posttranslational chemoenzymatic transformation. This method exploits the unique reactivity of ribosomally incorporated thioamides, enabling enzyme&#8208;free spontaneous heterocyclization to form thiazoline (Thn), which is further oxidized using the substrate&#8208;tolerant azoline dehydrogenase (GodE) to yield a Thz moiety. By integrating this chemoenzymatic process with chloroacetyl&#8208;mediated thioether macrocyclization and mRNA display, we have successfully discovered Thz&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide ligands with high binding affinities against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 (PAK4). This study establishes a robust system to expedite ligand discovery of pseudo&#8208;natural peptides and to investigate the functional benefit of their backbone Thzs.

         <title>Discotic Liquid Crystalline Phenazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenazines, otherwise known as dibenzo annulated pyrazines, are a unique class of tricyclic organic molecules. They are chemically stable and highly aromatic due to their extended conjugation. Along with their biomedicinal significance, phenazines often play a major role in manipulating the optical as well as electrical properties of organic semiconductors. The planar structure in the heterocyclic aromatic phenazines and their natural inclination to form stacked columns due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between two consecutive molecules has made them quite a suitable moiety for the formation as well as extension of the core part of discotic liquid crystals. Their charge&#8208;carrying ability in electrolytes makes them well&#8208;suited for organic electronic materials. Furthermore, their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned with simple chemical changes rendering them appropriate for many advanced applications. This review focuses on the chemistry of phenazine&#8208;based discotic liquid crystals and their significance in optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent&#160;N6&#160;Versus&#160;Cvinyl&#160;Arylation of 8&#8208;Vinyl Adenine Nucleosides, Sequential Diarylation, Fluorescence Properties, and Computational Evaluations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary tranformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#8211;N versus C&#8211;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl adenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

With this focus, reactions of silyl-protected 8-vinyl adenosine and 2&#8217;-deoxyadenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8217;-bis(di-t-butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd-118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6-selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of BICAAC Organocatalyst: Hydroboration of Carbonyl and Alkyne Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (BICAAC) (I) has been used as a highly effective catalyst for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones and alkynes. The catalyst is effective across a broad range of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, indicating its robust functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, supported by both experimental studies and computational analyses, suggest the initial step involves the reaction of BICAAC (I) with pinacolborane (HBpin), leading to the formation of boron&#8211;carbene complex (active catalyst II). This active species facilitates substrate activation. A subsequent hydride transfer from an additional equivalent of HBpin to the activated substrate completes the reduction process. This stepwise mechanism underscores the dual role of HBpin as both a catalyst activator and a hydride donor. The interaction between BICAAC and HBpin is pivotal, as it modulates the electronic environment of the boron center to promote efficient hydride delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by ligand&#8208;assisted re&#8208;precipitation approach. Incorporating ICA ligand in place of long chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of non&#8208;radiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518 nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75 &#177; 2% to 94 &#177; 2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation), or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin switching devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R = C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 was investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. DFT calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8211; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the +III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman-GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8211; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the +III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII&#160;versus heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI&#160;complexes for circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8211;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;complexes&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs&#160;&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and&#160;&#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and the binuclear&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (glum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying&#160;1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in&#160;IrAu&#8208;4.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of &gt;99%.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
